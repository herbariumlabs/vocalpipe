The following points are to be considered while generating FTOs:

6.  Details of credits to beneficiary account will be shared by the sponsoring bank with the accredited bank and accredited bank will share the same with the PAO.

7.  PFMS would provide reports on State/UT-wise and District-wise expenditure under the scheme. Any additional reporting requirements for Programme Division and State/UT are to be made available to PFMS.

8.  The accredited Bank will send (on receipt of the same from sponsoring banks) lists of all successful and failed transactions to the PAO (scroll) along with amount of failed transactions.

3.  Upon receipt of the details from the State level functionaries, through a separate FTO, the Programme division will re-process the failed transactions tagging the unique file reference number.

Post Disbursement Actions:

1.  The intimation from Bank / NPCI (APB) regarding deposit of fund in beneficiary's bank account, generated as per the procedure of Controller General of Accounts (CGA), would be treated as Utilisation Certificate in terms of Rule 241 of General Financial Rules (GFR), 2017.
