  The Government with a view to augment the income of the Small and Marginal Farmers

  has approved a Central Sector Scheme, namely, "Pradhan Mantri Klsan SAmman Nidhi (PM­ KISAN)" in the current financial year. It has been decided to launch the scheme by the Hon'ble Prime Minister on the 24^(th) February, 2019 followed by transfer of benefits to farmers directly to their bank account on the same day. The transfer of benefits would be executed through NPCI. In this regard, the following points may kindly be ensured:
