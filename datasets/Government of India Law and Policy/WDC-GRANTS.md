Methodology:

  Data Collection and Integration:

- Collect and integrate data from various sources, including satellite imagery, sensor data, hydrological models, and field surveys.

- Incorporate socio-economic data to understand community needs and intervention impacts.

Data Analytics:

- Apply machine learning algorithms and statistical models to analyze hydrological and environmental data.

- Develop predictive models for water flow, soil erosion, and crop yield potential.

Decision Support System Development:

- Design a user-friendly DSS interface with visualization tools for data interpretation.

- Integrate scenario analysis features to evaluate different watershed management strategies.

Validation and Pilot Testing:

- Conduct pilot testing in selected watersheds to validate the DSS's effectiveness.

- Incorporate feedback from stakeholders to refine the system.

Expected Outcomes:

  A comprehensive DSS that integrates multi-source data for enhanced watershed management.

  Improved predictive capabilities for water resource availability, soil conservation, and agricultural planning.

  Enhanced decision-making for policymakers and stakeholders, leading to more efficient watershed interventions.

Significance of the Study:

  The proposed DSS will significantly contribute to sustainable watershed management, enabling data-driven decisions that enhance water use efficiency, improve crop productivity, and reduce land degradation.
