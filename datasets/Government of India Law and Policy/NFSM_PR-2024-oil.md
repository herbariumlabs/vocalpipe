STEPS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION OF OILSEEDS AND EDIBLE OIL

  Posted On: 09 FEB 2024 5:06PM by PIB Delhi

  The Government has been implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme viz., National Food Security Mission- Oilseeds & Oil palm (NFSM-OS&OP) from 2018-19 to augment the availability of edible oils by increasing the production and productivity of nine oilseed crops and area expansion under Oil Palm & Tree Borne Oilseeds in the country.

  Under the NFSM- Oilseeds, incentives/ subsidies are being provided to the farmers through State Government for three broad interventions viz. (i) seed component covering purchase of breeder seeds

  , production of foundation seeds & certified seeds, distribution of certified seeds, distribution of seed minikits & seed hub (ii) production inputs component covering seed storage bins, Plant Protection (PP) equipments & seed treating drum, PP chemicals, distribution of gypsum/ pyrites/ lime etc., Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus/ bio agent, supply of bio-fertilizers, improved farm implements, sprinkler sets, water carrying pipes, and (iii) transfer of technology component covering cluster/ block demonstrations, Frontline Demonstrations, Cluster Frontline Demonstrations and training through National Agricultural Research System and Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Integrated Pest Management through Farmer Field School (FFS) mode, training of farmers, training of officers/ extension workers, need based R&D project including seminar/ kisan mela and oil extraction unit under flexi funds.

  Now, the Government has launched a separate mission i.e. National Mission on Edible Oils (Oil Palm)- NMEO (OP) in 2021-22 to promote oil palm cultivation for making the country Aatmanirbhar in edible oils with special focus on North Eastern States and Andaman & Nicobar by increasing area of Oil Palm from 3.70 lakh hectares to 10.00 lakh hectares in 2025-26.

  Both NFSM- Oilseeds and NMEO (OP) are being implemented in the country with the objective of augmenting the availability of edible oils by increasing the production and productivity of oilseeds & oil palm and reducing the import burden.

  In addition to above, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana- RAFTAAR (RKVYRAFTAAR) provides provision for crop production related activities on oilseeds. Under RKVY-RAFTAAR, the states can also implement programme on oilseeds with the approval of State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) constituted under the chairpersonship of Chief Secretary of the state.

  Finance Minister during her budget speech 2024 has made following announcement:-

  “Building on the initiative announced in 2022, a strategy will be formulated to achieve ‘atmanirbharta’ for oil seeds such as mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean and sunflower. This will cover research for high- yielding varieties, widespread adoption of modern farming techniques,

  market linkages, procurement, value addition, and crop insurance”.

  Due to efforts of the Government, the import dependency of edible oils have been reduced from 63.25% in 2015-16 to 57.30% in 2022-23 and domestic production has increased from 36.75 % in 2015-16 to 42.71 % in 2022-23 of the total demand of the country despite rise in overall demand of edible oil.

  The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India organizes National Conferences on Agriculture Campaign before sowing season of Zaid, Kharif & Rabi to discuss various issues related to upcoming sowing season. In these conference issues related to seeds are also discussed. The details of National Conferences organized by Ministry in last three years are given below:
