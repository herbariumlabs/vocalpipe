   venue	, phone numbers and e-mail\] and weekly training schedule for release of first instal-

   ment of training funds by MANAGE as well as monitoring by MANAGE/DOE. The training

   schedule of 45 days programme should be as per standards	https://[www.agriclinics.net/](http://www.agriclinics.net/)

   scheme-training.html	developed by MANAGE. Names of resource persons for each ses-

   sion should be clearly mentioned in the Training Schedule. The travel expenses incurred by the candidate for reaching the training institute and for returning home after training will be borne by the candidate only.

   3. The 45 days training programme aims at transforming persons qualified in the field of agriculture and allied sectors into agri-entrepreneurs. It is an intensive capacity building effort by the NTI faculty in association with locally available experts and successful agri-entrepre- neurs. The training programme is divided into two categories of activities:

      1. Exposing the trainees into potential agri-ventures in their area and providing addi- tional subject matter training to refresh their knowledge and skills. Besides motivation, train- ing will also concentrate on building communication skills, record maintenance, schemes/ programmes from where financial assistance is available etc. For instance, trainees inter- ested in setting up Soil Testing Laboratories, Small Scale Bio-inputs Preparation Units, Cus- tom Hiring of Machineries will be imparted requisite skills and knowledge. The basic idea is to customize the training modules based on individual and collective needs of the entire group while adhering to the prescribed syllabi which is available at https://[www.agriclinics.net/scheme-](http://www.agriclinics.net/scheme-) training.html. MANAGE shall prescribe relevant You Tube videos and online modules for the training programmes.  
         2. Facilitate the trainees to choose a venture and to prepare DPR based on market survey and hands on experience with the support of experienced bankers. Detailed interac- tions should be arranged with stakeholders such as farmers, bankers, department officials,

   input dealers, NGOs working in the area etc. Identification and analysis of farmers problems

   and providing solutions through extension and business advisories are focused upon. As- sessing technical feasibility and financial viability of ventures, hands-on interface with the successful entrepreneurs and DPR preparation with assistance by experienced bankers as resource persons are the other crucial parts of this activity.

      4. MANAGE will coordinate scheduling of training in each NTI by sanctioning one or more batches simultaneously depending on the availability of selected candidates, infrastructure and logistic facilities at the NTIs.  
      5. The threshold percentage for success rate for awarding another course to the same NTI shall be minimum 35 % every year. Based on documentation prescribed for assessing the success rate, verification shall be carried out by any two members of the team mentioned

   at Para 4.1.1 above	nominees of sufficiently senior levels will also be permissible for this

   purpose	based on the record available in NTI. This team of two or more members shall also

7

consider periodic & surprise inspection reports while recommending sanction of another course. One such report is mandatory at the end of the year to extend training to the next year.

6. The NTIs shall also send following reports to MANAGE	As per formats available in

   https://[www.agriclinics.net](http://www.agriclinics.net/)	:

1. In addition to the final feedback as per	iv	below, feedback shall be given by every

trainee at least twice during the training period	with a gap of at least two weeks in

feedbacks by the same candidate	in the web-based interface provided for this pur-

pose. Such feedbacks shall begin from 10 days after commencement of the course.

2. Final list of candidates in the prescribed format after 20 days of commencement of training, but within 35 days.

3. During the last week of Training, NTIs will guide and ensure that each trained candidate

9

6. Incentives to Candidates and NTIs:

   1. NTIs with cumulative and respective batch success rate of more than 50 percent are eligible to get an additional incentive of Rs. 2000/- per candidate for every candidate estab- lished after 50% success rate, reported in respective batch. NTIs shall submit receipt to MAN- AGE for accounting purpose and Utilization Certificate is not needed for this amount.

      2. Every candidate who establishes his/her venture and submits proof to that effect is eligible to receive an incentive of Rs. 1000/-. This incentive amount may be electronically transferred to the candidate on verification by NTI and random verification by MANAGE.

         3. As hand holding and reporting the progress are continuous activities, MANAGE may release the hand holding amount to NTIs on bi-monthly basis.

      7. Payment of hand holding charges to another NTI:

         1. Presently, the Training Institutes where the candidates undergo training receive the

   hand holding charges. For some reasons	e.g. distance, inactive NTIs etc	, the NTI which

   trains a particular candidate might not have been able to submit the DPR or successfully complete the hand holding support leading to setting up of venture. While such hand holding is to be provided for one year, a trained candidate may know whether the hand holding is on the right track, from MANAGE.

         2. If a venture is not successfully established within one year and the candidate feels that this has happened due to the lack of appropriate hand holding by NTI that trained him, he may opt for subsequent hand holding by a different NTI. In such a case, full hand holding

   amount of Rs. 9,000/-	or	3000/-	where even the first instalment would not have been

   disbursed due to non-submission of DPRs	or the amount excluding the first instalment of

   Rs.1500/-	if DPRs are submitted	which will be considered for hand holding charges only

   after the trained candidate expresses his willingness to get associated with such other NTI in writing to MANAGE. Besides this, the NTI which is willing to provide hand holding to a candi- date not trained by it has to convey its willingness to MANAGE in writing to provide hand holding. Confirmation about setting up of a successful venture as a sequel to such hand holding by another NTI will be reported in the prescribed format. The above steps will ensure non-duplication of payment to more than one NTI. Responsibility of hand holding of candi- dates trained by NTIs, which have been subsequently declared as inactive, may be given to willing/active NTIs in respective States.

      8. Criteria for declaring Recognized NTI as Inactive NTI:

1. Not conducting any programme during the last one year	Except NTIs in J\&K, Ladakh and NE States

2. Cumulative Success rate below 35%	Except NTIs in J\&K, Ladakh and NE States

3. Not starting training within six months from the date of signing MOU J\&K, Ladakh and NE States

4. Not providing hand holding activities as per guidelines

Except NTIs in

5. Default in submitting Utilization Certificates	UC	for more than a year

to be declared

inactive only after receiving UCs	.

10

6. Violating the norms of Guidelines, MOUs signed with MANAGE or the above instructions. Any one of the criteria is sufficient to consider any NTI as inactive.

   6. Certificates to successful ventures:

   Certificates are being issued to trainees by MANAGE after successful completion of 45 days training. It has been decided that successfully established ventures will a get a certifi- cate recognizing that their enterprise is set up under the Scheme. Such certificates will be issued to ventures after verification and recommendation by PD, ATMA, Programme Coordi- nator of KVK or Head of nearest Research Station of State Agriculture University/ICAR insti- tute as per the following procedure.

* On establishing the venture and running it successfully	including provision of extension

  services	for at least 6 months, the candidates will seek the certificate from MANAGE

  through respective NTI by submitting the verification report and recommendation to MAN AGE as above.

* Certificates consisting Candidate s ID No. and venture details will be issued by MAN AGE indicating the date on which verification was conducted.  
  This certificate entitles the agripreneurs to be recognized by the Development Departments and KVKs of same/nearby districts in supplementing the efforts of public extension services. Proof of establishment of venture will be provided in the format given in Annexure VIII.

  7. Refresher & Sensitization Trainings and Workshops:

     1. Every year About 500 selected agripreneurs will undergo refresher training in 20 batches of 25 candidates each. This training of about 3-5 days duration may be conducted in special- ized Institutions like SAUs/ ICAR Institutes /IIMs/IITs/CSIR Institutes /DST Institutes/ reputed Private/ Non- governmental Institutions. Candidates who have lapsed 5 years or more after completion of training and not established any venture will be given preference. Remaining slots will be filled with those completed training within 5 years, but not established ventures, followed by established agripreneurs who have lapsed 5 or more years. Detailed financial norms for refresher courses under AC\&ABC Scheme are given at Annexure-IX.  
     2. NABARD will organize sensitization training/workshops to motivate the bank- ers across the country to provide credit to Agripreneurs for establishing ventures. One State level training/workshop followed by District level trainings/workshops in at least 50% of the total Districts shall be organized by NABARD every year in each State/UT. Budget of Rs. 25 lakh per year has been provided to NABARD for the purpose. NABARD will submit details of cost norms, numbers of courses, duration and officers to be trained. NABARD will necessarily inform MANAGE and DA\&FW for participation of their representatives in such sensitization programmes. These trainings /workshops shall be organized in physical /virtual mode depending on the prevailing situations/ feasibility and availability of funds. NABARD shall prepare the tentative calendar for workshops for the entire year, during the first quarter of every year, and communicate to all concerned stakeholders. NABARD shall promote “One

  Bank Branch	One Agri-Clinic” as decided in the 11th Bankers review meeting and

  report the progress on monthly basis to the Ministry.

11

5. FINANCIAL SUPPORT:

   Trained candidates can avail financial support in the form of credit linked back ended subsidy. Banks shall extend credit facilities for establishment of ventures by trained candi- dates under priority sector norms as per the provision at Para 6.3 of Chapter-III of RBI circu-

   lar, RBI/ FIDD/ 2016-17/33	Master Direction-FIDD.CO.Plan.1 /04.09.01/2016-17	dated

   July 7, 2016 or as amended from time to time.

   1. Linkage with Credit and Subsidy:

      1. Assistance under the scheme would be purely credit linked, subject to sanction of the project by banks based on economic viability and commercial considerations. The eligible financial institutions under the scheme are:  
* Commercial Banks  
* Regional Rural Banks  
* State Cooperative Banks  
* State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks

* National Scheduled Castes Finance & Development Corporation  
* National Backward Classes Finance & Development Corporation  
* National Safai Karmachari Finance & Development Corporation  
* Such other institutions eligible for refinance from NABARD.

  2. Project Cost Ceiling for Subsidy:

NSFDC NBCFDC NSKFDC

1. Ceiling of project cost for subsidy is Rs.20 lakh for an individual project	25 lakh in

   case of extremely successful individual projects	and up to Rs. 100 lakh for a group

   project	Established by a group comprising at least 5 trained persons under the scheme	.

   The bank may, nevertheless, subject to their own satisfaction, finance groups with 2	4

   trained persons also under the scheme, within the Total Financial Outlay	TFO	ceiling

   Rs. 20 lakh per trained person for the purpose of subsidy. However, the actual credit sanctioned by the bank for a venture established under the scheme could be higher de- pending on the financial viability and technical feasibility. Thus, for instance, if an indi- vidual is granted a loan for TFO of Rs. 35 lakh, subsidy shall be reckoned only on TFO of

   Rs. 20 lakh. In case of group projects with candidates of different categories	General/

   Women/SC/ST/PWD	, subsidy shall be calculated as per the eligibility for each category

   of members by dividing the project cost equally among the members keeping Rs.20 lakhs as the TFO ceiling per each candidate.

   2. To encourage exceptionally successful individual agripreneurs, the project cost limit for subsidy purposes may be extended by Rs. 5 lakh in addition to the generally applicable project cost limit of Rs. 20 lakh for calculating subsidy. This will serve as an incentive to an agripreneur to expand his/her already established and successful venture. Format for consid- ering such cases is given on the MANAGE website [http://www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/An-](http://www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/An-)

   nexure-Xpdf	Ventures which score minimum 75 marks as per the format will be considered

   exceptionally successful	. Such cases are to be approved by the Empowered Steering Com-

   mittee using the criteria given at Annexure X based on the recommendation of the Banker

12

and ATMA officials.

3. In order to provide extension services using web-enabled resources of DA\&FW and other agencies, computer, printer and broadband connection should be an integral part of TFO.

   4. To attract more women candidates to the scheme parents/husbands/ in \-laws of the trained women candidates can be made co-borrowers with the eligibility for subsidy.

   3. Term Loan:

      1. For getting credit linked subsidy benefit, the credit availed from banks shall be term

   loan which would be composite in nature and participating bank	s	would extend bank loan

   as per the TFO, which would include fixed capital cost and working capital for one operating cycle for dealing with inputs like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, organic manures etc. Loan sanctioned will be the differential amount between TFO and margin money. Trained agripreneurs shall submit the DPRs with loan applications through Jan Samarth Portal https:/

   /[www.jansamarth.in/home.](http://www.jansamarth.in/home) and	or	https://agriinfra.dac.gov.in/Home.

      2. Composite subsidy will be provided even for low capital investment cases as it is

   definitely possible that some agripreneurs already have capital	e.g. a building	to start a

   venture, thereby requiring minimal capital investment. At least 10% value of the Total Finan- cial Outlay of the project should be in capital form.

      3. The repayment schedule will be drawn on the total amount of the loan	including

   subsidy	in such a way that the subsidy amount is adjusted after liquidation of net bank loan

      excluding subsidy	.

      4. Repayment period will depend on the nature of activity and will vary between 5 to 10

   years. The repayment period may include a maximum grace period of 2 years	to be de- cided by the financing bank as per needs of individual projects.

      2. The margin money to be contributed by the general category entrepreneur will be as per prevailing norms. However, concessions would be made in respect of SCs/STs, women and beneficiaries of North-Eastern States, Hill areas. In such cases, a maximum of 50% of the margin money prescribed by banks could be given by NABARD to meet the shortfall in

13

borrower s contribution, if the bank is satisfied that the borrower is unable to meet the mar- gin money requirements. Such assistance to banks by NABARD will be without any interest. The banks may, however, levy a service charge up to 2% per annum from the borrowers.

5. Security:

   As most of the eligible activities pertain to agricultural input supply and services and the cost of investment will be less than Rs. 25 lakh in most cases, the security norms applicable to tiny industries as prescribed in RBI circular No. RPCD.PLNFS.BC.65/06.02.31/ 99-2000 dated 31.3.2000 would be made applicable to these units.

6. SUBSIDY:

and depending on the amendments

National Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development	NABARD	is the nodal agency for

implementation of subsidy component through financing banks for credit linked projects. NABARD has to ensure that at least 50% of the ventures established under the programme, every year, are getting the subsidy benefit.

1. Eligibility for Subsidy:

   1. All candidates trained under the scheme as per Para 3 including all sub-paras and fulfilling the conditions in all sub paras related to credit facilities under Para 5 shall be eligible for subsidy. Subsidy shall be credit linked. Trained candidates, whose knowledge acquired during the training might have become obsolete due to passage of time, may undergo a refresher course. Whether or not a candidate trained sufficiently long time ago needs his skills to be upgraded by refresher courses, shall be decided by the Selection Committee for candidates at the NTI level. However, need for such refresher trainings shall not be consid- ered, if the training has been within 5 years before date of loan application. Funds for such skill upgradation courses can be pooled from various resources including MANAGE coordi- nation charges, savings from funds allocated for refresher courses and budget earmarked for advertisement and publicity of ACABC Scheme with DOE.

      2. Delivery of extension services shall also be a component of AC\&ABC projects for availing of the benefit of subsidy under the Scheme.

   2. Linking Subsidy Adjustment to Delivery of Extension Services:

      1. Adequate safeguards are put in place to ensure providing extension services by the

         15

   agripreneurs to their clients. For this purpose, any two out of a group of rank and status not below the following officials/ persons would make a periodic / surprise inspection at least on quarterly basis and submit its report to NABARD/ financing bank / office of ATMA. Record of advisory services provided to farmers by the agripreneurs as per the format given at Annex- ure XI may form the basis for providing the report.

* Block Technology Manager/Subject Matter Specialists under ATMA

* Chairman	or his nominee	, ATMA Block Farmers Advisory Committee

* Panchayati Raj Members  
* NABARD / Bank official  
* Block level officer of State Department of Agriculture and allied sectors.  
* Heads of nearby EEIs/KVKs/ICAR Institutes/Director Extension of SAUs/CAUs.

  2. A consolidated report has to be finalized before the expiry of three years lock-in period. The financing bank has to send the report to the NABARD and ATMA for information. The report may highlight nature of enterprise initiated by agripreneur, its coverage / reach, impact on income of agripreneur, impact on farmers and agricultural development in the area.  
     3. States are encouraged to provide information on all government policies, programmes, schemes etc to agri-preneurs and also use their services in implementation of extension activities funded by the government like Agricultural Technology Management Agency

  ATMA	, Public Private Partnership	PPP	model.

  3. Change of Capital & Interest Subsidy to Composite Subsidy:

     1. Subsidy pattern has been revised from capital and interest subsidy to Compos-

  ite Subsidy in case of bank financed projects which will be back-ended in nature. It will be

  44% of project cost or Total Financial Outlay	TFO	for women, SC/ST/ PwP & all catego-

  ries of candidates from NE and Hill states and 36% of total project cost or TFO for all others. Interest subsidy scheme is replaced with enhanced quantum of back-ended subsidy, subject to a maximum amount equal to the total loan amount.

     2. The subsidy admissible under the scheme will be kept in the “Subsidy Reserve Fund

  Account”	Borrower-wise	in the books of the financing bank. No interest will be charged on

  this by the bank. In view of this, for the purposes of charging interest on the loan component, the subsidy amount should be excluded by the banks. The balance lying to the credit of the “Subsidy Reserve Fund Account” will not form part of Demand and Time Liabilities. NABARD will ensure that the banks do not charge interest on subsidy portion of the loan from the date the subsidy is credited in the “Subsidy Reserve Fund Account”, as back-ended subsidy is released to banks up-front.

     3. In all new cases, subsidy will be released as Composite Subsidy	Annexure XIII	.

  The subsidy in all such cases will be worked out on the basis of the Fixed Capital and one

  Operating Cycle of the Working Capital as a Composite Loan. Loan / subsidy	i.e. capital

  and interest	cases sanctioned so far	but not yet closed	shall be converted to Compos-

  ite Subsidy regime and the differential amount between the Composite Subsidy and subsidy already	released	shall	be	paid	to	the	Agricultural	entrepreneurs

  agripreneurs	as per the Scheme Guidelines	Annexure XIV	. Entrepreneurs whose loan

16

accounts have been closed can avail fresh loan to expand the project activity or start a new venture under the scheme in which case the TFO for subsidy calculation be limited to Rs. 20

lakh	25 lakh in case of extremely successful	for Individual projects and Rs. 100 lakh for

Group projects	Annexure- XV	.

4. Candidates trained under this Scheme can avail subsidy from any Scheme of Central or State Government related to his/her field of agri-business, if it is beneficial to the candidate. However, subsidy for the same project cannot be availed from more than one Scheme by a candidate.

   5. Sometimes entrepreneurs start small and then ramp up their business later on. There- fore, it has been decided that the benefit of subsidy will be extended up to 2 times to a candidate under the Scheme as per the approved rates, mentioned at Para 6.3.1, of the project cost of Rs. 20/25 lakhs or Rs. 100 lakhs as the case may be. Such cases may include cases where the project is expanded in phases or financed in phases. However, if an existing venture is expanded or financed in phases, Composite Subsidy limits shall be reckoned only on such incremental component of Total Financial Outlay. Following are the cases where such a facility can be availed:

1. When two independent projects are financed to same beneficiaries.

2. When an existing project	that has availed subsidy under the scheme	is undergo ing expansion.

3. If the fresh/ expansion of project is sanctioned by the bank before August 4, 2010, the

TFO ceiling of 10.00 lakh	pre-revised	will be applicable. The TFO ceiling of 20.00

lakh	revised	would be applicable only for fresh/ expansion of project sanctioned

by the bank on or after August 4, 2010\.

However, in all such cases the maximum amount of subsidy shall be limited to the stipu-

lated TFO ceiling	for both projects put together	. In case of expansion of an existing ven-

ture, composite subsidy shall be computed only on the TFO for expansion. This will not in- clude the project cost of the existing project.

6. The subsidy will be back \- ended with minimum 3 years lock-in period. This implies that once the loan is taken with subsidy, the account cannot be closed within three years.

   7. The subsidy, which is back ended, will be admissible only if all repayments till date had been made. When there is procedural delay on the part of banks/NABARD to release sub- sidy, beneficiaries can opt for payment of only interest portion keeping principle amount equal to the subsidy value as balance. Subsidy release shall be done through AIF programme portal.

      8. The subsidy will be adjusted in one lump-sum against the last remaining instalments of repayment of bank loan.

      9. Banks should prescribe interest rates as per declared policy of the bank for the rel- evant sector, at the time of sanction of loan amount.

   4. Procedure for release of subsidy:
