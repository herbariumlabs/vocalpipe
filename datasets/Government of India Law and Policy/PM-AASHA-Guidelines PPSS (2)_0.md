  Sub: Guidelines for pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme under umbrella scheme of Pradhan Mantri - Annadata Aya Sanrakshan Abhiyan " PM AASHA"

1.  Title : This is a pilot scheme of Govt. of India under umbrella scheme of Pradhan Mantri - Annadata Aya Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM AASHA) and will be called as Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme(PPSS) for oilseeds.

2.  Objective : The objective of implementation of PPSS is to assess the workability of private agencies in the procurement operation at MSP . Till now procurement operations for ensuring MSP have remained in the domain of public sector and cooperatives only. There is a need to tap into the private sector expertise and efficiencies for procurement operations. Therefore, it is essential to test the workability of Private Procurement Stockist Scheme on pilot basis for oilseeds. A well designed and closely monitored private sector intervention can be made to serve the cause of farmers' welfare without an additional burden on the government exchequer. Such an intervention may be particularly required in regions with production surpluses but there exists no effective demand. In such areas private sector led procurement operations will create a demand and possibly influence the market positively. In such areas, the private trader should promote warehouses, processing mill, so that it is the processed product that is transported and not just the raw produce.
