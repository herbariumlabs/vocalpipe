  GUIDELINES FOR ACCREDITATION OF CHEMICAL AND BIO-PESTICIDE TESTING LABORATORIES AS PER ISO 17025

Necessity for accreditation

  Accreditation is the formal recognition, authorization and registration of a laboratory that has demonstrated its capability, competence and credibility to carry out the tasks it is claiming to be able to do. It provides feedback to laboratories as to whether they are performing their work in accordance with international criteria for technical competence.

  As per National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) accreditation is the third party attestation related to a conformity assessment body (Laboratory) conveying the formal demonstration of its competence to carry out specific conformity assessment task.

  In simple words, for Pesticides Testing Laboratories, accreditation is necessary to show their competence in the work of analysis of pesticides. Laboratory accreditation is a mean to improve Statkeholders confidence in the test reports issued by the laboratory, so that the stakeholders like Pesticide manufacturers and their association may not doubt and shall accept the reports with confidence.

  Benefits of Accreditation

Formal recognition of competence of a laboratory by an Accreditation body in accordance with international criteria has many advantages like:

1.  Increased confidence of all stakeholders in Testing Reports issued by the laboratory.

2.  Better control of laboratory operations and feedback to laboratories as to whether they have sound Quality Assurance System and are technically competent

3.  Savings in terms of time and money due to reduction or elimination of the need for re-testing of products.

ISO 17025

  ISO (International organisation for standardisation) is an independent, non-governmental organization with a membership of 162 national standards bodies. Through its members, ISO brings together experts to share knowledge and develop voluntary, consensus-based, market-relevant International Standards that support innovation and provide solutions to global challenges.

  ISO 17025, General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories, is the international reference for testing and calibration laboratories wanting to demonstrate their capacity to deliver reliable results.

  ISO 17025 enables laboratories to demonstrate that they operate competently and generate valid results, thereby promoting confidence in their work both nationally and around the world. It also helps facilitate cooperation between laboratories and other bodies by generating wider acceptance of results between countries. Test reports and certificates can be accepted from one country to another without the need for further testing, which, in turn, improves international trade.

Recognized Organization in India for providing accreditation as per ISO 17025

  Although there are few autonomous bodies/ institutes which are providing accreditation as per ISO 17025. However, National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) which is a constituent Board of Quality Council of India is an internationally recognized board for accreditation, as per International standards. NABL has been established with the objective of providing Government, Industry Associations and Industry in general with a scheme of Conformity Assessment Body’s accreditation which involves third-party assessment of the technical competence of testing including medical and calibration laboratories, proficiency testing providers and reference material producers.

  NABL maintains its linkages with the international bodies like International Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation (ILAC) and Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation (APLAC). NABL is a full member of both and regularly takes part in the Technical Committee Meetings of both ILAC & APLAC, engaged upon development and updating of guidelines connected with accreditation activities. In order to achieve the objective of the acceptance of test/ calibration data across the national borders, NABL operates and is committed to update its laboratory accreditation system as per international norms.

  The laboratory accreditation services to testing and calibration laboratories are provided by NABL in accordance with ISO 17025: 2017 ‘General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories

Requirements and procedure for getting accreditation from NABL

  Getting ready for accreditation

14. Laboratory has to maintain records of Internal audit as well as training documents of IA in respective form and files

Accreditation Process

  An applicant laboratory will apply on the website of NABL for submission of application and the concerned fee. The Legal identity of laboratory, Authorised signatory and quality manual prepared by the laboratory will be submitted online. For different discipline the laboratory has to apply separately.

  The Quality Manual will be forwarded by NABL to a Lead Assessor to judge the adequacy of the Quality Manual as to whether it is in compliance with ISO 17025 standards.

  Thereafter the Lead Assessor will conduct a Pre-Assessment of the laboratory for one day. Based on the Pre-Assessment report the laboratory may have to take certain corrective actions, so as to be fully prepared for the final assessment.

  Finally, when the laboratory is ready, the Lead Assessor and a team of technical assessors will conduct the final assessment. The number of technical assessors will depend on the number of disciplines applied for. The accreditation process involves a thorough assessment of all the elements of the laboratory that contribute to the production of accurate and reliable test data. These elements include staffing, training, supervision, quality control, equipment, recording and reporting of test results and the environment in which the laboratory operates. The laboratory may have to take certain corrective actions, after the final assessment.

  After satisfactory corrective actions are taken by the laboratory (within a period of one month), the Accreditation Committee will examine the report and if satisfied recommend accreditation. The time required for the process of accreditation will depend upon the preparedness of the laboratory and its response to the non - conformances raised during the pre-assessment and final assessment. The total duration ranges between 6 and 8 months.

Surveillance and Re-Assessment

  Accreditation to a laboratory shall be valid for a period of two years.. The laboratories may enhance or reduce the scope of accreditation during surveillance. After every year, Lab has to apply for the desktop surveillance audit which is conducted in NABL office itself for the work done by the Laboratory to check the technical competence to comply ISO 17025 standard.

  The laboratories need to apply for renewal of accreditation, at least six months before the expiry of validity of accreditation for which a re-assessment shall be conducted.

  The information on fees of accreditation and its further maintenance may be gathered from NABL document No 100.
