Objective of the Scheme

  Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) aims to mitigate the hardship of the insured farmers against the likelihood of financial loss on account of anticipated crop loss resulting from adverse weather conditions relating to rainfall, temperature, wind, humidity etc. RWBCIS uses weather parameters as “proxy‟ for crop yields in compensating the cultivators for deemed crop losses. Pay-out structures i.e. Term Sheets are developed to the extent of losses deemed to have been suffered keeping the weather triggers as per requirement of the crop and comparing it with actual weather data for the specific period. The whole crop life cycle is divided into different phases i.e. periods keeping in view the crop phenology and accordingly the sum insured is allocated to each period based on susceptibility of crop to the insured peril during a specific phase.

Adoption of Technology for Scheme Administration:

1.  In an endeavour to integrate Technology in implementation and execution of the Scheme, the Govt. of India has designed and developed a National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) (www. pmfby.gov.in). This will bring in better administration and coordination amongst stakeholders viz. Farmers, States, Insurers and Banks as well as real time dissemination of information and transparency.

2.  The successful running of the Portal calls for responsible participation by different stakeholders who will have the responsibility for census coding and updating revenue/administrative units, AWS code mapping and updating requisite information/details as per login credential module

3.  Implementing States and Insurance Companies during each crop season are required to digitize and upload on the web Portal in the relevant module, basic information like notified areas, crops, sum insured, Govt. subsidy, and premium to be paid by farmers and name of the implementing Insurance Companies in the particular insurance unit etc., well within the prescribed time. This will facilitate farmers and other stakeholders to get the relevant information on Internet and through SMS. State Govt. and concerned Insurance Company will be responsible for any incorrect entry/ errors/ omissions etc.

4.  Digitization of basic information/notification should compulsorily be done before floating tender documents which will be followed by entry of bid Premium rates and name of selected Insurance Company immediately after finalization of bids and issue of work order.

  For further details please refer Para 2 of Revised Operational Guidelines of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY).

Coverage of Farmers

1.  Refer para 3 of Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

Coverage of Crops

I.  Food crops (Cereals ,Millets and Pulses),

II. Oilseeds

III. Annual Commercial / Annual Horticultural crops.

  State Government can consider only those crops for notification under the RWBCIS who have demonstrated correlation on impact of selected weather perils on the yield of the crop and should be examined and approved by the State Level Technical Committee (SLTC).

Coverage of Risks and Exclusions

1.  Entire or partial crop life cycle stage susceptible to crop loss due to inclement weather conditions are covered under the scheme. All such perils which are caused by the weather conditions and are measurable and quantifiable in Automatic Weather Stations or Automatic Rain Gauges stands covered under RWBCIS, subject to notification of the same by the State Govt. through a term-sheet.

Weather Perils to be Covered:

  Following major weather perils, which are deemed to cause “Adverse Weather Incidence”, leading to crop loss, shall be covered under the scheme:

a)  Rainfall – Deficit Rainfall, Excess rainfall, Unseasonal Rainfall, Rainy days, Dry-spell, Dry days

b)  Temperature– High temperature (heat), Low temperature

c)  Relative Humidity

d)  Wind Speed

e)  A combination of the above

  The perils listed above are only indicative and not exhaustive and any addition / deletion may be considered by State Govt. in consultation with SLTC and empanelled insurance companies based on availability of relevant data.

1.  Add-on coverage: The States may consider providing add-on coverage for crop loss due to hailstorm, - cloudburst and pre defined high wind speed etc wherever the risk is perceived to be substantial and is identifiable. The add-on coverage will be optional for the farmers and applicable notional premium will be borne by the farmer, however the State Govts may consider providing additional subsidy on this coverage, wherever notified. The actuarial premium rates for add-on coverage should be sought in the bid itself from the Insurance Companies, however the add-on actuarial premium rate will be considered

  separately and shall not form part of evaluation of L1. State Government can consider to allocate the add on risks to the lowest bidder for this products separately.

2.  State Government shall consider covering such perils which are capable of causing severe & quantifiable loss and can be induced directly or indirectly by change in measurable weather parameters to capture the losses during the adverse climatic conditions and have demonstrated correlation with quantifiable yield losses of crop due to such perils.

3.  Only adverse weather incidences which can cause substantial crop losses should only be covered, or the triggers identified in such a way that major losses are captured. Too conservative triggers tend to lead to frequent but smaller payouts, diluting the indemnity principle of insurance.

4.  State Governments will also continue to conduct the requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in areas where RWBCIS is implemented to enable the State Government and implementing Insurance Companies to make analytical study for assessing performance of the Scheme vis-à-vis yield Index based crop Insurance Schemes (i.e. PMFBY) and Benchmarking of products.

5.  The specific “Adverse Weather Incidence” with its timing / duration applicable to a particular Notified crop shall be notified by the SLCCCI.

6.  General Exclusions: Losses arising out of war and nuclear risks, malicious damage and other preventable risks shall be excluded.

7.  Crop damage for localised calamities under Add-on Cover losses will be assessed on the basis of individual insured farm level and hence lodging of loss information by farmer/designated agencies is essential. For remaining risks losses are caused due to weather conditions and hence lodging of intimation for claims by insured farmers / designated agencies for such weather conditions is not essential. Claims will be calculated based on the actual weather data received from the concerned agency for reference AWS/BWS/ARG as notified by the concerned State Govt.

Period of Risk (i.e. Insurance Period)

  Risk period would ideally be from sowing period to maturity of the crop. Risk period depending on the duration of the crop and weather parameters chosen, could vary with individual crop and reference unit area and would be notified by SLCCCI before the commencement of risk period.

Preconditions for implementation of the Scheme

States:

Issuance of Notification by State Govt/UT for implementation of the scheme (RWBCIS) will imply their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the scheme. The main conditions relating to RWBCIS which are binding on States/UTs are as follows.

1.  Adoption of innovative technology especially establishment of AWS & ARGs in the State and use of NCIP platform for flow of information and auto administration of the scheme.

2.  States need to arrange/provide the requisite weather data for calculation of admissible claims.

3.  Weather data will be uploaded on the national crop insurance portal/submitted to insurance company within the notified cut off date.

4.  State/UT will make necessary budgetary provision for premium subsidy based on fair estimates, at the beginning of the crop season.

5.  Dept of state govt which was earlier looking after implementation of erstwhile National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS)/National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP*) may be designated as Nodal Department for implementation of RWBCIS. The State Level Coordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI) which was overseeing implementation of NAIS and NCIP* may be authorised to oversee implementation of RWBCIS. The states/UTs which had not implemented the NAIS/NCIP* shall constitute SLCCCI for implementation of RWBCIS on the lines similar to that of NAIS/NCIP*. The present composition of SLCCCI may be strengthened by including representatives from State Horticulture Dept., State Remote Sensing Application Centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Farmers’ Representatives and empanelled Insurance Companies for implementing RWBCIS. Chairman of SLCCCI may co-opt representatives from other departments/agencies, if considered necessary.

Insurance Company:

  Please refer Para no 6.2 of Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

Submission of UID (AADHAAR) by farmer:

  Please refer Para no 6.3 of Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

Notification

  The Scheme shall operate on the principle of “Area Approach” in the defined areas called Reference Weather Unit Area (RUA) and may be equivalent/similar to “Insurance Unit Area” defined in OGs of PMFBY. For other relevant notification, refer Para No 7 of Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY.

1.  Notification of Reference Weather Stations (RWS) and Authorized Data providers

    1.  Only those AWS/ARGs of IMD/State Govt. /private agencies should be considered and notified which are as per standards defined by IMD/WMO and are certified and approved by IMD/any agency to be notified by the State/Central govt. These must be optimally operational and be able to provide real time weather data. AWS/ARG of private agencies should only be considered in absence of properly functioning AWS/ARGs of IMD/ State Govt. AWS /ARG data sourced for crop insurance should be transferred on real time basis to National Portal. The detailed guidelines for sharing of weather data on the Portal will be circulated separately.

    2.  SLCCCI based on distance and location and availability of Automatic Weather Stations / Automatic Rain Gauge will approve “Reference Weather Stations (RWS) for RUA‟s. In addition to RWS for all RUAs, additional weather stations designated as Back-up Weather Stations (BWS) shall be compulsorily notified for use in case RWS is unable to provide data for any reason. Information of RUAs along with RWS and back up weather stations shall be covered in notification issued at the commencement of the season. Such AWS & ARG should meet the requirements &standards as recommended in report of the committee constituted to draft the Guidelines for setting up Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs) and Automatic Rain Gauges (ARGs) by private agencies and their accreditation, standardization, validation and quality management of weather data etc. circulated by this Department in 2015.

    3.  Any new AWS/ARG including 5000 AWS planned to be established under PPP mode with support from Govt. of India, should be set up following the guidelines envisaged in the report of the above

  mentioned committee.

4.  All claims shall be settled based on actual data recorded by the RWS. There is no protocol to revise or make change in the actual weather data recorded by the Reference AWS (notified). The insurance companies / their data provider will provide daily weather data recorded in the notified AWSs / ARGs to the State Govt. on request and they should also be given access to view real time weather data of the notified AWSs / ARGs, if so desired.

Assessment of Loss / Shortfall in Yield

1.  The Scheme operates on the basis of ‘Area Approach’ i.e., Defined Areas for each notified crop for weather parameters i.e at Block/Taluka/Revenue Circle level, to be decided by the State/ UT Govt.. State Govt. Department/third party overseeing setting up of AWS will submit day wise weather data as per cut-off date decided by SLCCCI, on National Crop Insurance Portal. Weather data so arrived at will be approved/ uploaded by the concerned authority/State nodal department and made available to Insurance Company.

2.  To bring better transparency and confidence in the weather data, state must mandatorily ensure 100% data from Automatic Weather Stations and Automatic Rain Gauges only. No other source of weather data shall be used or referred to for providing data for claim settlement. Secrecy and security of AWS/ARG locations should be maintained in order to rule out moral hazard and tempering of weather data/station.

3.  In order to provide proper benefit to the farmers and to compensate them as per the actual loss experience, AWS/ARG shall be installed and notified at lowest possible level of revenue/administrative hierarchy.

4.  State should strengthen audit process for inspection, calibration and validation of standards of the sensors used in the AWS/ARG for collection of weather data. Standards of setting up and installation of AWS/ARG shall be followed as prescribed in relevant IMD/Govt. Of India guidelines.

5.  Wherever services of external/third party agencies are utilized for setting up of AWS/ARG and provisioning of weather data, only licensed, certified and accredited agencies with adequate experience shall be considered.

6.  District level Steering Committee: State Govt shall compulsorily constitute a Steering committee in each district to plan, install/outsource/arrange and supervise the AWS/ARG for weather data and to facilitate provisioning of weather data to the State Nodal department.

  The Steering committee should be headed by District level Head of Department/Organisation responsible for implementing crop insurance. The Steering committee will compulsorily associate the representatives of Insurance Companies. Head of Steering Committee will be responsible for uploading of all requisite information on National Crop Insurance Portal. Steering Committee will compulsorily send all their proceedings / minutes etc to DLMC and Nodal officer of the State. Concerned Insurance Companies shall compulsorily deploy one well conversant official at the office of head of Steering Committee for better coordination. District Administration will provide requisite space and logistics at the office for the insurance company official.

7.  In instance where weather data could not be collected due to fault/malfunctioning of reference AWS, weather data of back-up station shall be used for calculation of claims. In absence of availability of weather data from back-up AWS, weather data from nearest IMD station shall be used.

Dispute resolution regarding Weather Data/Crop loss

1.  Wherever the weather data provided are abnormally low or high vis a vis the general weather condition; the Insurance Company in consultation with State Govt. can make use of weather data from back-up Weather Station or nearby IMD station. If Insurance Company witnesses any anomaly/deficiency in the actual weather data(partial /consolidated) received from the concerned agency, the same shall compulsorily be brought into the notice of concerned State department within 7 days from date of receipt of weather data with specific observations/remarks under intimation to Govt. of India and anomaly, if any, may be resolved in next 7 days by the Arbitration Committee headed by Principal Secretary/Secretary of the concerned Department in consultation with the State/Regional representatives of IMD.

2.  The Arbitration Committee may refer the case to State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) for dispute resolution (Constitution of STAC is defined in Para 19.5). In case the matter stands unresolved even after examination by STAC, it may be escalated to TAC along with all relevant documents including minutes of meetings/records of discussion and report of the STAC and Arbitration Committee. However, data with anomalies which is not reported within 7 days will be treated as accepted to insurance company. The protocol of timelines defined above shall also be applicable to the actual weather data being provided by the concerned agency in batches, i.e. Crop-wise-District- wise-Phase wise lots of data and timelines for each batch of data shall be counted separately/batch wise. Unnecessary delay in finalization of weather data will attract penal interest on due claim amount payable to the farmers as decided by the STAC in the matter.

3.  The existing Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) comprising of representatives from Directorate of Economics and Statistics, DAC&FW, MNCFC, NSSO, IASRI, India Meteorological Department (IMD) etc will be further augmented and constituted under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary, DAC&FW

  and additional members depending on case to case basis will be drawn from various organizations namely, relevant institution under Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI), National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Space Applications Centre (SAC), Central Statistical Organization(CSO), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), National Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development (NABARD), any other such organisation.

4.  The role of TAC shall be to review the technical matters related to execution of the Scheme. In case, the matter requires further focused deliberations, the TAC will refer the issue to Technical Agency. Technical Agency (TA) will compulsorily take input/reports/relevant information from concerned State Department and Insurance Company and may also opt for representatives of other organizations/experts (if required) with permission of chairman of TAC and follow the procedure as defined in the SOP.

5.  State shall also constitute the State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) on similar pattern to resolve disputes. The STAC may be chaired by the Principal Secretary/Secretary of the concerned department with members from State Agricultural University, State Remote Sensing Centre, IMD (state centre), DES, any ICAR centre in the state, NSSO, etc.). However, in case of disagreement between the concerned parties, the case may be referred to TAC along with recommendations and findings for further deliberation/examination and decision.

6.  TAC/TA/STAC shall deliberate and examine the subject matter and indicate their views /decisions based on statistical/technological inputs and other related scientific and technical parameters.

Use of Innovative Technologies

1.  State Govt. should strive for setting of a dense network of Automatic Weather Station and Automatic Rain Gauges specially for a larger benefit of generally agriculture sector and specifically the farmers. The weather data inputs from these stations can be used by the respective State Governments for various agro-advisories, sowing, cropping, harvesting and marketing planning, consultation and advisories to the farmers.

2.  Such weather data from these stations can also be used for identification and validation of loss triggers for crops covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna. State Government can also find utilization of such weather data for testing and development of new products and risk mitigation methods for the Agriculture/Horticulture and allied agricultural sectors.

  For further relevant details, please refer Para no 22 of Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY.

Assessment of Claims

1.  Insurance company shall be responsible for all claims arising out of adverse weather incidence and shall settle claims strictly as per the terms and conditions of the scheme mentioned in the notification. In case of adverse weather incidence all the insured cultivators growing the notified crop in a RUA shall be deemed to have suffered the same level of adverse weather condition & same proportion of crop loss and become eligible for the same rate of claims.

2.  Claims shall be assessed only on the basis of weather data recorded by the notified RWSs or BWS, as the case may be, and the claims process shall commence once the weather data is received. The weather data providers should ensure that the exposure conditions of AWS, their standardization / calibration, maintenance and weather data transmission meet the guidelines issued by the Government.

3.  []Claims processing should be strictly as per the insurance term sheets, payout structure and the Scheme provisions. Claims shall be worked out as per the Insurance Declarations received from the Nodal Branches/ Nodal Banks for each notified area and crop.

4.  If observed index value falls below or above, (as the case may be) the notified trigger value, then claims per unit shall be calculated using following formula depending upon index definition:

5.  Claims per Unit = (Difference between Observed & Notified index values) X Notional Payout .Overall claims will be ‘Claims per Unit’ X ‘Number of units’.

  RUA X: In this case notified trigger value is 200. Observed index value is 300. In this case there would be no claim payable as the notified trigger is not breached.

  RUA Y: Here observed index value is 120.

  Hence, claims per unit will be: {(200-150)*50}+{(150-120)*80} = Rs. 4900. For two hectares, overall claim= Rs. 4900 X 2= Rs. 9800/-

  RUA Z: Here observed index value is 80 which has breached the exit level. Hence in this case the full sum insured assigned to the phase of Rs. 6500 per unit would be payable.

  For two hectares, overall claim= Rs. 6500 X 2= Rs. 13000/-

  Using the methodology discussed above, total claims will be worked out.

ANNEXURE- 1

Suggestive Illustration for Preparation and Evaluation of Term Sheet

  []Crop life cycle is divided into 3-4 phases according to phenology and crop growth stages taking place in growth cycle of the crop (i.e. critical stages). For example, if rainfall period is from 15th June to 31st August. The requirement of rain (water) by the crop plant may also vary fortnightly (i.e. 1-15th July, 15-31st July, 1-15th August, 16-31st August, 1-15th September and so on) or monthly or such other period that the State Government decides. Therefore, the requirement of rainfalls / weather parameters should be assessed for each fortnight / month according to historical data and crop phenology and requirements of the crop. The pay-out trigger(s) should be fixed strictly according to demonstrated correlation with requirement of weather parameters to the crop at each critical stages and also soil types, topography etc.

  If rainfall period is from 15th July to 31st October, the requirement of rain (water) by the crop plant may also vary fortnightly (i.e. 15-31st July, 1-15th August, 16-31st August, 1-15th September and so on) or monthly or such other period that the State Government decides on prevailing weather condition.
