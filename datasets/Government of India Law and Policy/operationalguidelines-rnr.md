**_Operational Guidelines for Coconut Development Board Schemes_**

Replanting and Rejuvenation of Coconut Gardens (R&R) 2024-25

**Background:** The prevalence of disease advanced, old, and senile palms, poor genetic base of the planting material under cultivation, poor management attention given to the crop and severe incidence of pest and diseases and drought are the major reasons for the low productivity of coconut in coconut growing states. One of the strategies to vitalize the coconut industry is to improve the general agricultural base with large scale replanting and rejuvenation of the coconut gardens.

**Goal:** Goal of the scheme is to increase production and productivity of coconut by promoting adoption of cutting and removal of disease advanced, old, and senile palms and integrated management practices to address state specific problems in coconut growing states.

**Objective:** The main objective of the scheme is to enhance production and productivity of coconut by removal of disease advanced, old, and senile palms, replanting with quality seedlings and rejuvenating the remaining palms through an integrated package of practices.

# Components of the scheme

*   Cutting and removal of all disease advanced, old, and senile palms.
*   Replanting with quality seedlings limited to optimum plant population recommended for coconut in the concern state.
*   Rejuvenation of existing gardens through integrated management practices.

## Cutting and removal of all old, senile, unproductive and disease advanced palms

A subsidy @ Rs.1000 per palm, subject to a maximum Rs.32000/ha shall be provided to the farmers for cutting and removal of disease advanced, old, and senile palms.

The cutting and removal of disease advanced, old and senile palms shall be undertaken on the basis of the initial base line survey to be taken up in individual holdings through a prescribed proforma (copy of the proforma enclosed). It is mandatory to cut and remove the disease advanced, old and senile palms identified and marked during the base line survey, over and above the ceiling of assistance by incurring expenditure of their own for eradicating the foci of infection. The palms identified for cutting and removal in the project area should be yielding less than 10 nuts / year. The palms to be cut and removed should be clearly marked. The palms identified in the project area for removal shall be approved by the Agricultural/ Horticulture Officer of concerned state Department of Agriculture/ Horticulture. Cutting and removal of the palms identified should be completed within 3 months of the approval. The time limit can be relaxed by the State Government.

## Assistance for replanting

*   Cutting and removal of disease advanced, old, and senile palms shall be followed by a systematic replanting programme to maintain optimum plant density. A subsidy of Rs.40/- per seedling ie 50% of cost (Rs. 80/- per seedling) subject to maximum of Rs. 4000/ ha is admissible for replanting. The applicant should use only quality coconut seedlings for replanting. The seedlings for replanting should be procured from nurseries of the State Department of Agriculture/ Horticulture or State Agricultural Universities / CPCRI nurseries or from recognised nurseries with known parenting.
*   While replanting the palm population should not exceed the recommended planting density of the state @ 160/ha.
*   Replanting in all cases should be completed within the planting season succeeding the cutting and removal.

## Rejuvenation of the existing coconut palms through Integrated Management Practices

The integrated management involving the following practices is essential:

*   Balanced nutrition through soil test based fertilizer application ( organic/ inorganic)
*   Irrigation and drainage
*   Soil and moisture conservation
*   Growing of cover crops and other green manure crops
*   Intercultural operation including basin management and weed control
*   Need based plant protection measures preferably with botanicals and bio-agents.
*   Regulation of shade and maintaining optimum palm population and
*   Promotion of inter cropping/mixed farming.

For adoption of Integrated management practices, a subsidy of Rs.17500 /ha will be provided in two annual installments of Rs.8750/-each ie 25% of cost (Rs.70,000/ha) in two equal installments. The maximum eligibility for availing assistance under this component is 4 ha per beneficiary. The maximum assistance under the scheme as per the approved guidelines is limited to Rs.53,500 per ha for two years altogether for the above three components viz. cutting and removal, rejuvenation of existing garden and replanting.

# Guidelines for Implementation of the Replanting and Rejuvenation Scheme

*   The project will be implemented by the state Department of Agriculture/ Horticulture of the concerned state in association with the Coconut Development Board.
*   The project will be implemented in the most disease affected districts in farmer participatory mode in contiguous areas.
*   A quick roving survey has to be conducted in the project area by a team consisting of officials of Department of Agriculture/ Horticulture and State Agriculture University, of the concern state. The team shall make estimation for removal of disease affected old and senile palms per hectare.
*   Basic details of the agriculture scenario of the implementing area shall be collected and furnished to the Board.
*   A base-line survey will be carried out in a farmer participatory mode covering all holdings in the project area. The palms for cutting and removal, number of palms for rejuvenation, seedlings required for replanting and other prevailing agricultural practices will be documented by the farmers themselves and verified by the concerned Officer of Deptt. of Agriculture/ Horticulture of the concern state.
*   Based on the information collected in the base line survey, the officials of the Department of Agriculture/ Horticulture shall facilitate the formulation of the project report.
*   The district level consolidated project reports shall be prepared by the District Level Agriculture

/ Horticulture Officer and presented to the State Level Committee.

*   Actual number of seedlings that need to be replanted after removal of diseased/senile unproductive palms has to be worked out keeping in view the optimum planting density (160-

175 palms per ha subject to the limitation of topography) as recommended by the state Agriculture University.

*   Irrigation component and drought management practices have to be included in the integrated management practice in the state. The irrigation schemes of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare under the ‘Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana’ (PMKSY) may be linked with the proposed irrigation component. Besides, assistance extended under other schemes viz., State Horticulture Mission (SHM), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yogana (RKVY) may also be converged for adoption of integrated management practices.
*   Implementation of the scheme will be supervised and monitored by the District Level Monitoring Committee constituted by the State Government.
*   The project report recommended by the District Level Committee shall be placed in the State Level Monitoring Committee for approval of the Projects.
*   Chief Coconut Development Officer, CDB, Kochi or representative as a member with Director/ Deputy Director, CDB, Regional Office/ State Centre for the state will be the convenor of the State level Monitoring Committee.
*   Funds should be released to the individual bank accounts of the eligible farmers through online in DBT mode after cutting and removal, rejuvenation and replanting with quality seedlings.
*   The funds shall be released to the state through PFMS platform based on the milestones for scheme implementation.
*   The State Government may, if required, provide additional financial support to the farmers from own resources to any or all components of this project.
*   Systematic replanting measures to be adopted so as to maintain the optimum palm density in the gardens during replanting.
*   Proper documentation/ registers for the project implementation with beneficiary wise details & photographs during cutting of palms and replantation as well as for input distribution to be maintained by the field level implementing agency.
*   **Geotagging** is mandatory for implementation of Replanting & Rejuvenation (R&R) scheme.
*   Monthly progress report to be furnished periodically and final progress report along with Utilisation Certificate on completion of the project to the Board.
*   Final outcome of the scheme implementation shall be documented and furnished to CDB on completion of the project. Documentation of the pre and post implementation of the scheme with photographs to be maintained for visible impact of the scheme.
