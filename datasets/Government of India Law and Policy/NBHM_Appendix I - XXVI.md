  Setting up of Integrated Beekeeping Development Centre (IBDC) at District level as a Role Model

  Infrastructural facilities are not available for integrated development of beekeeping in the country, particularly at grass root level. The facilities, including availability of bee hives & other equipments, quality queen bees, bee colonies, honey processing facilities, basic information relating to beekeeping, information on marketing of bees and bee products, etc. are not accessible to the farmers/ beekeepers in the country due to non-availability of infrastructural facilities. Due to non- accessibility of information to the public, the general public is not fully aware about the importance of beekeeping in overall sustainable development of Agriculture/ Horticulture by enhancing productivity of crops, role in environmental sustainability and bio-diversity and its other benefits. Though the National Bee Board, under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) has made efforts to create awareness about the role of beekeeping in Agriculture/ Horticulture by organizing various National & State/Regional Seminars and so many other capacity building programmes in various parts of the country. To speedup / gear-up the growth of beekeeping by promoting Scientific Beekeeping, there is need for setting up of Integrated Beekeeping Development Centers (IBDCs) at National /State/ Regional/ District levels. In these centers all the infrastructural facilities and information & demonstration units, etc. may be developed in integrated manner. Infrastructural facilities for collection, handling, storage, marketing and export of honey and other bee products, small honey processing plant, bee equipments manufacturing unit, etc. may also be developed. The State Govts. Agencies/ Organizations in association with State Agricultural Universities and expert member societies/ firms/ companies of NBB, including Cooperative Societies, Federations, Corporate Sector, etc. may develop these centers on PPP mode under overall guidance and supervision of NBB. The setting up of these centers may serve the purpose of overall development/ promotion of Scientific Beekeeping in the Country/ State / Region/ District assigned to the respective center. These facilities may also be directly linked with the beekeepers to extend the benefits of these facilities. Mainly the following units / centers be created/ developed in the IBDCs:

(i) Nucleus stock development unit/ Queen bee rearing/ multiplication centre.

(ii) Multiplication of nucleus stock into bee colonies (Bee Breeding Centre).

(iii) Equipments manufacturing unit/ centre.

(iv) Training and other capacity building programme centre.

(v) Awareness, motivation and latest technological advances/ new innovations centre.

(vi) Information centre for scientific beekeeping.

(vii) Technology & impact demonstration centre.

(viii) Center for collection & storage of honey and other bee products & their quality control.

(ix) Processing and marketing centre.

(x) Various products development centre, etc.

(xi) Disease diagnostic lab.

(xii) Honey & other bee hive products testing laboratory.

(xiii) Registration & expert advice, guidance, monitoring/ supervision unit, etc.

(xiv) Bee surveillance/disaster management centre, etc.

(xv) Developing bee friendly floral/ Bee Garden.

(xvi) Any other unit/ centre.

2.  For setting up of one IBDC at least 20-25 acres of land will be required. Out of this land, about one fourth to one fifth of area may be covered in the form of building & sheds in which all the above mentioned various units /centers may be set up. The remaining area may be used to plant /grow the bee friendly flora/plants /crops. The approximate expenditure on each of the center may vary from Rs. 5 to 15.00 crores, depending upto existing infrastructural facilities with the organization/ agency and States to States/ Region to Region, developing for IBDC. The cost includes the cost of building/ shed/ construction, setting up of the above units/centers, staff, etc. (excluding cost of land).

3.  Hon’ble Prime Minister has also, among others, desired that at least one district in each State should be developed as a role model for beekeeping. Therefore, the proposal of setting up of IBDCs at Distt./ Regional level has great importance and the State Govts. have been, time to time, requested to take action in this regard. The funding of these centres may be explored by the State Govts. under NBHM/ RKVY/ MIDH, etc. schemes of Govt. of India and State Govt. Hence, decision on setting up of IBDC may bring breakthrough in overall sustainable development of robust bee keeping industry in the country.
