Brief Overview

Introduction

  The Department of Land Resources (DoLR) was earlier implementing three area development programmes namely Drought Prone Area Programme (DPAP), Desert Development Programme (DDP) and Integrated Wastelands Development Programme (IWDP) on watershed basis. These three programmes were integrated and consolidated into a single modified programme called the Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) with effect from 26.02.2009. Department of Land Resources has sanctioned 8214 watershed development projects in 28 States (except Goa) [during the period 2009-10 to 2014-15] (now 27 States and 2 Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh) covering an area of about 39.07 million hectare, under Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) for development of rainfed and degraded areas. The activities undertaken, inter alia, include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rainwater harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for assetless persons, etc. In 2015-16, the IWMP was amalgamated as the Watershed Development Component (WDC) of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). Since inception of the scheme, an amount of Rs. 19926.67 crore has been released to the States /UTs as Central share.

  The defined life span of WDC-PMKSY got over in March, 2021. However, on the request of various States/UTs and with due approval of the competent authority, the project period has been extended till March, 2022.

  The Government has approved the continuation of programme as WDC-PMKSY 2.0 for the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26 with physical target of 4.95 million ha and indicative financial outlay of Rs. 8,134 crore, as the Central share. Under WDC 2.0, a total of 1099 projects have been appraised and sanctioned in 28 States and UT of J &K.

  WDC-2.0 shall be implemented according to the Guidelines for New Generation Water which has already been issued to the States /UTs. The main features and the major improvements envisaged in the new guidelines inter alia include the following:

- The cost norm of Rs. 28,000/- per ha. for hilly & difficult area, Rs.22,000/- per ha. for other areas and upto Rs. 28,000 per ha. for watershed projects in Integrated Action Plan (IAP) Districts.

- DPR of projects to be based on actual requirement. Per unit cost as proposed from Center, and over & above cost to be met by States through convergence or from their own budget.

- Geo-tagging of all planned activities before implementation, Outcome and impact-oriented and user-focused monitoring (before & after).

- Project period reduced from 4 - 7 years to 3-5 years.

- Introduction of Farmers Producers Organizations (FPO) right from planning stage of the project.

- Focused efforts on climate change issues.

- Spring-shed development- Introduced as new activity under watershed projects.

- Introduced building Land Resource Inventory at least for 10% of the sanctioned projects.

- Introduced- Participatory Water Budgets is to be carried out one each in pre and post rainy seasons.

  Therefore a Management Information System of WDC-PMKSY 2.0 has been developed and deployed which may act as a tool for monitoring of projects sanctioned by DoLR, Govt of India. It captures the basic information related to each project such as Base line Survey details of each project, Financial targets/plan and achievement related to each project, Ground water table. FPOs/ SHGs, EPAs/Livelihood/Production system etc. There are different stake holders at each level who will be filling these data online. The stakeholders can also view the flow of action plan/achievement against each project at all levels. A citizen section provides to view the reports available in public domain.

Features:

  WDC-PMKSY 2.0 MIS software is a webbased workflow system that facilitates to cover all the projects sanctioned by DOLR in 27 States and 2 UTs. Financial data would be integrated in MIS from PFMS system along with integration with NRSC 2.0 geo-spatial applications. The key features of the software are :

  Workflow and Integration - Captures the workflow of Physical Action Plan/achievements/Work-ID against the projects. WDC-PMKSY2.0 MIS is an integrated system with PFMS and NRSC 2.0 Applications. LGD code has been used for integration between the applications.

  Reports - A number of reports are generated to help even a general user in a very effective way. There is a vast range of reports for the ease of the application users. A number of detailed reports are incorporated there.

  Availability – The software is web based and is available on 24*7 basis with proper login authentication.

  Security - Encrypted password are used and password expiration facility for the continuous wrong entry of the password. WDC-PMKSY2.0 software has been security audited.

Target Users

  WDC-PMKSY 2.0 MIS users include:

- Central Government Departments

- State Government Departments

- Rural Local Bodies

- District-Level Line Departments

- Financial Institutions

- District Planning Committees

- Citizens

  In WDC-PMKSY 2.0 MIS there are various Stake holders who would be responsible to enter the data related to WDC-PMKSY 2.0 Projects. These stake holders are : DoLR (Govt. of India) , SLNA, WCDC,PIA. PIA would be responsible to feed the data on behalf of GP and WC.

  All the reports related to WDC-PMKSY 2.0 projects would be in the public domain which can be accessed by citizen.The diagram shows the various Users of WDC-PMKSY 2.0 MIS application.

General Workflow

  WDC-PMKSY 2.0 MIS software is based on workflow system. The information/data flows from one stake holder to another stake holder. In this software, there are different stake holders who have different roles and functions. These stake holders are DoLR , SLNA, WCDC (District) ,PIA (Project Implementing Agency).
