About Implementation Guidelines

  The Pilot Scheme of Nagar Van Yojana (NVY) was started in 2020 with some modifications in existing Nagar Van Udyan Scheme during launched in 2015. From the experience gained in its implementation and discussion held with the States/ UTs from time to time, it has been observed that it is very difficult to find forest land within Municipality limit and that too in the extent of minimum 10 ha, which resulted in slow implementation of Scheme.

  The Nagar Van Yojana (NVY) has, therefore, been reviewed to bring more area under the scheme and to reach out to all cities with Municipality. The Revised Nagar Van Yojana aims at developing 400 Nagar Van and 200 Nagar Vatika with the objective to significantly enhance the tree outside forests and green cover in cities leading to better environment, enhancement of biodiversity and ecological benefits to the urban and peri-urban areas apart from improving quality of life of city dwellers.

  The salient features of the revised scheme are as under:

1.  All cities with Municipal Corporation / Municipalities/Urban Local Bodies (ULB) are proposed to be covered under the scheme.

2.  For Nagar Van minimum area limit is 10 ha to any size, but the grant will be limited to a maximum of 50 ha.

3.  In congested part of the cities minimum 1 ha to 10 ha can be taken up as Nagar Vatika.

4.  Nagar Van site can be up to 5 km distance from the city limit, taking into account future expansion of cities and provide greener surroundings.

5.  Area other than forest land can also be considered

6.  The Scheme proposes development of 400 Nagar Van and 200 Nagar Vatika in four years i.e. 2021-22 to 2024-25.

7.  Municipal Corporation/ Municipalities/ULBs and other Land owning agencies can also submit proposals through concerned State Forest Department for financial assistance.

8.  Development and Management of Nagar Van and Vatika should encourage PPP mode with active participation of people, students and other stakeholders.

9.  Selection of trees should be from the species best suited for local conditions with emphasis on enriching biodiversity, planting of fruit bearing, medicinal plants species to attract birds, butterflies etc., enhancing ecological values and pollution abatement.

10. All Nagar Van/ Vatika must be open to public subject to suitable restrictions.

11. At least two third area of Nagar Van/ Vatika must be under tree cover/ wood lands. Nagar Van/ Vatika may include components of Biodiversity Park, Nakshatra Van, Butterfly Conservatory, Waterbody, Smriti Van and Herbal Garden etc. to attract people and help in in-situ conservation of biodiversity.

12. The financial assistance component remains the same i.e. Rs. 4 lakh per Ha.

  The above modifications have been incorporated in the guidelines appropriately.

  Introduction

  The forests of India constitute the first line of defence against pollution resulting from economic activity, whether of agricultural or industrial origin. So there is a need to preserve this line with adequate policy interventions for protecting and enhancing India’s forest cover and to counter the perils of climate change.

  Urbanization is a global phenomenon, the degree of urbanization and the rate of urban growth varies in different parts of the world. This uncontrolled urbanization resulted in deterioration of natural resources and environment in urban areas in many of the cities in India as well as in the world. Nearly two third of the world’s population is expected to live in urban areas by 2025. Increase in population has adversely affected the green cover in urban India. Due to this urbanization trend, distance between city inhabitants and nature is increasing. Rapid urbanization has led to severe depletion of forest cover in the last few decades. The depletion of forest cover has in turn adversely affected the ecological balance and the economic stability of the society. The health of the people has been affected as well.

  The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) is focused on enhancing forest quality and increasing tree cover for maximizing carbon stock as well as to tackle the ill effects of urbanization. With a view to achieve these objectives, Ministry has taken many initiatives to bring out transformational changes in our policies and programmes and implement several initiatives with the peoples’ participation.

  The Nagar Van Scheme was initiated during June, 2020-21 during ‘World Environmental Day’ Celebrations. The implementation of the revamped “Nagar Van” Scheme, from the Nagar Van Udyan Yojana implemented during 2015, aimed to develop ‘Nagar Vans’ across the country in next five years. The Scheme is revised with a renewed focus on peoples’ participation, and is to be implemented in collaborative mode by various agencies. The primary objective is to create forest/green spaces in urban areas, by protecting forest/non-forest land within cities/towns or its vicinity from degradation and encroachment. The scheme is designed to actively engage local residents and different agencies in

  developing bio-diverse forests for social and environmental benefits in an urban landscape.

  The efforts so far made towards ameliorating the ill effects of climate change through afforestation/tree plantation programmes of the Ministry have succeeded to certain extent. Considering there is a need to move towards a holistic approach, necessary modifications in the existing interventions are inevitable. The implementations Guidelines of NVY have been revised based on the feedback from the implementing agencies. These implementation guidelines are expected to give clear idea of the scheme and to expand its benefits by covering more area under the scheme.

Expected Scheme Outcomes

  A Nagar Van/Nagar Vatika is expected to have following outcomes:

1.  Improved air quality, pollution abatement, carbon sequestration, reduction in temperature and urban heat island effect, water and soil conservation.

2.  Creation of a green space having aesthetic value with cooling and calming effect on the minds of people.

3.  Development of green spaces may also make cities climate resilient besides providing ecosystem services.

4.  Indirect effects could be promotion of tourism and expansion of business and trade thus improving local economy.

5.  Urban forests could offer several positive community physical and mental health benefits.
