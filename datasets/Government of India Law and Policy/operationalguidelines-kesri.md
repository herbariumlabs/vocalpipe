# Kera Suraksha Insurance Scheme

**\- Operational Guidelines**

## Need for Insurance cover

One of the major challenges faced by coconut farmers today is the **shortage of skilled climbers** for timely harvest and plant protection measures. Recognizing this, the Coconut Development Board (CDB) launched an **innovative initiative** called the **‘Friends of Coconut Tree’ (FoCT)** program, aimed at attracting unemployed youth to the agriculture sector and addressing the shortage of coconut tree climbers.

The FoCT program provides skill development training, equipping interested individuals with the knowledge and tools needed for a green- collar job in coconut tree climbing. Trainees learn to use specially developed machines for climbing, along with techniques for scientific palm management, pest and disease protection, and other related activities.

Understanding the risks associated with this profession, CDB introduced the Kera Suraksha Insurance Scheme to ensure the safety and security of climbers. This scheme provides comprehensive financial and medical coverage to mitigate the impact of unforeseen accidents during their work.

Regular harvesting is crucial to maintaining high productivity and ensuring the health of coconut palms. Climbers play a vital role not only in harvesting but also in inspecting the palm crowns for signs of pests or diseases and carrying out remedial actions. However, the inherent risks involved in climbing make it a dangerous profession, further underscoring the importance of programs like FoCT and the Kera Suraksha Insurance Scheme.
