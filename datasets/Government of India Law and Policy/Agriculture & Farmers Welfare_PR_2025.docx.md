The Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DA\&FW) has been making concerted efforts to enhance the production and productivity of crops aiming to enhance the income of farmers. The MoA\&FW is committed towards taking several initiatives to empower the farmers through their capacity building on thrust areas such as crop diversification and production aspects in terms of qualitative inputs and judicious use of farm resources. The major achievements of the DA\&FW for the welfare of farmers are summarized below:

1. **Unprecedented enhancement in budget allocation-** During 2024-25 an amount of Rs 122528.77 crore has been allocated under various schemes and programmes for welfare of the farmers.

2. **Record Food Grain Production-** The food grain production for 2023-24 is recorded at

   332.30 million tonnes, while horticultural production stands at 352.23 million tonnes, according to the third advance estimates.

3. **Income support to farmers through PM- KISAN-** PM-KISAN is a central sector scheme

   launched on 24th February 2019 to supplement the financial needs of land-holding farmers. Under this scheme, the financial benefit of Rs. 6,000/- per year in three equal instalments every four months is transferred into the bank accounts of farmers' families across the country through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode. The scheme leverages technological and process advancements so that the maximum number of beneficiaries can benefit without any hassle. PM-KISAN is one of the largest DBT schemes in the World. A total of over Rs

   3.46 lakh Cr has been disbursed to more than **11** Cr PM KISAN beneficiary farmers through 18 instalments.
