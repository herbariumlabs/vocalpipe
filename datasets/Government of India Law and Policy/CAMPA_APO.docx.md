# **Sub: Submission of Integrated APOs in revised format for approval to the National Authority inclusive of physical activities and financial targets under APOs of CSS, State Plan, CAMPA** & **any other scheme \-Reg**

Madam/Sir,

The Executive Committee of National CAMPA Authority in its various meetings has emphasised that an integrated APO should be prepared by State/ Union Territory CAMPA Authorities for its consideration and approval. It has been observed that APOs are still being received without complete information viz. giving details of physical activities and financial implications in CSS, State Plan and any other scheme being implemented by State Forest Departments. It is reiterated that the physical and financial details of the individual activities mentioned in the Annual Plan of Operations of the States/UTs need to be submitted to the National Authority CAMPA as per the revised format of the Integrated APO. As mentioned in the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Rules, 2018 (Rule 38\) the Annual Plan of Operation of the State Authority shall be prepared in Form XII (Annexure I) and shall be submitted by the State Authority before 31st December of the year to the National Authority for the next financial year. However, many States/UTs are yet to furnish their APOs of 2023-24 in the format prescribed for the purpose and the summary of the proposed activities is to be provided in the Annexure-11.

2. While preparing APOs, attention should be paid to the fact that CAMPA funds are an additionality and not a supplementary fund to meet the shortages in the State Fund. The fund under CAMPA are to be utilized primarily for undertaking regeneration (both artificial and assisted natural regeneration) to compensate the loss of forest and ecosystem services to  
* create more forest, for improvement in quality of forests and the wildlife habitat. As per CAF Rules, at least 80 per cent of the NPV funds should be utilized for the purpose of forest regeneration and improvement in quality of forest and maximum of 20% only be used for essential infrastructure support and capacity building that has direct impact on extension and improvement of forest cover and wildlife habitat. Further, CAMPA funds should not be spent on routine protection activities which are to be supported from State funds. The protection of forest, forest related infrastructure development, wildlife protection, wildlife-human conflict mitigation and other ancillary activities are to be taken up through other funds (e.g. State Plan, CSS schemes etc.)

3. Therefore, NPV component in the APOs should be focused for site specific forest regeneration and restoration activities which require greater degree of resources and attention in short time to overcome the challenges for effective outcomes and addressing drivers of degradation and deforestation. The Executive Committee has decided that as a matter of principle, not more than 20% of the NPV funds available with the State should be spent annually except in special programmes/ projects, where it can go upto 25% of NPV.

4. Accordingly, the details of the following activities are required to be furnished by the States/UTs in the revised fonnat for their due approval by National Authority, CAMPA:

1\.	Site-specific activities as per Section 6(a) of the CAF Act, 20I6

11\.	Activities as per Rule 5(2) ofCAF Rules, 2018

111\.	Activities as per Rule 5(3) of the CAF Rule, 2018 1v.	Activities as per Rule 6(a) of CAF Rules, 2018

v.	Activities as per Rule 6(b) ofCAF Rules, 2018

5. The spill over works/ activities and committed liabilities like meeting fund requirements for maintenance of ANR and other afforestation/ incomplete construction of buildings should be the first priority on NPV funds.

6. It has been observed that the APOs received from some of the States do not include Annexure II. Therefore, the States/UTs Authorities are requested to prepare integrated APO for submissions as provided in Annexure II, Annexure Ill and Annexure IV highlighting all the activities given as per Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act, 2016 and Rules, 2018. In the enclosed revised Integrated APO format, it is to be ensured that similar proposed activities/items are not placed under multiple places mentioning against different rules/sub-rules.

   Yours faithfully,

Encl. as above
