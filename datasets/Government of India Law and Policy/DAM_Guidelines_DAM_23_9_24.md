Background 

1.  The agriculture sector plays a vital role in development of the Indian economy. To augment the sector's contribution to the nation's growth, India's central and state governments are implementing several schemes to benefit the nation's farmers. Taking into cognizance the role of technology in providing better services to the citizens of the country, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW), Govt of India, is witnessing a paradigm policy shift from the traditional approach to farming and monitoring scheme implementation to embracing AgriTech.

2.  In recent years, India's digital revolution has transformed governance and service delivery by creating digital identities and secured payments and transactions. This has spurred a thriving digital ecosystem in finance, healthcare, education, and retail, positioning India as a leader in citizen-centric digital solutions. Some examples include Aadhar, which is a Unique Identification Number that is linked to the individual's biometric readings; Digi Locker for storing an individual's data securely; eSign, which lets individuals electronically sign contracts and eliminates the need for physical documents; eKYC facility for instant verification of an individual; Aadhar-enabled Payment Bridge and Unified Payments service (UPI) for trustful digital payments; Electronic Health Records (EHR); Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing (DIKSHA), etc.

3.  To create a similar digital ecosystem in the agriculture sector, the government announced building digital public infrastructure for agriculture in the Union Budget 2023-24. Further, in the Union Budget 2024-25, the augmentation of the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) initiative for the agricultural sector was announced. This Digital Public Infrastructure aims to provide comprehensive and useful data on farmers comprising authenticated demographic details, land holdings and crops sown. It will include cultivators & tenant farmers, as per the policy of the State Government. It would also connect to relevant Digital Public Infrastructure of the State Governments and Ministries of the Government of India to use data of farmers on livestock, fisheries, soil

  health, other vocations, family details and schemes and benefits availed, leading to innovative farmer-centric digital services in the agriculture sector.

4.  In line with the Viksit Bharat@2047 vision, the cabinet has approved the Digital Agriculture Mission (hereinafter called "Mission"). This initiative aims to create a robust digital agriculture ecosystem in the country, fostering innovative, farmer-centric digital solutions and providing timely and reliable crop-related and farmer-related information. The adoption of digital technologies in agriculture will help improve scheme governance by providing easier access to services, bringing greater transparency, enabling data-driven decision-making, and facilitating evidence-based monitoring.

Digital Agriculture Mission 

About Digital Agriculture Mission

1.  The Digital Agriculture Mission seeks to enable a robust digital agriculture ecosystem in the country to drive innovative farmer-centric digital and space-tech solutions. Accordingly, the Mission is conceived as an umbrella scheme to support digital agriculture initiatives, such as creating Digital Public Infrastructure, Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES) and other IT initiatives undertaken by Central GovernmenUState GovernmenUAcademic & Research Institutions. The Cabinet has approved the Digital Agriculture Mission with a total outlay of { 2,817 Crores with a Central Share of { 1,940 Crores for 5 years (FY 2021-22 to FY2025- 26).

  Digital Agriculture Mission aims to establish a comprehensive farmer-centric digital and space-tech ecosystem to enhance transparency and efficiency in the execution of government programs while providing crucial support for evidence-based policymaking for farmers' welfare.

2.  The Digital Agriculture Mission aligns with the Government's vision of transforming India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. The success of Digital Public Infrastructures in other sectors, such as health, education, finance, etc., underscores the potential for similar transformative impacts in the agriculture sector.

Objectives of Digital Agriculture Mission

  Key objectives of the Digital Agriculture Mission are highlighted as under:

a)  To create a robust and holistic farmer-centric digital ecosystem in the country.

b)  To improve transparency and efficiency in the implementation of government initiatives.

c)  To support the government in making informed policy decisions.

d)  To promote public and private innovation and partnerships, encouraging Agri techs in India's digital economy.

Benefits of the Mission

  By leveraging trustful data on farmers, farmlands and crops and the use of modern digital technologies, such as data analytics, artificial intelligence, and remote sensing, the Mission aims to make service delivery mechanisms more efficient and transparent in the interest of farmers in the following areas:

1.  A farmer would be able to digitally identify and authenticate himself/herself to access benefits and services, obviating cumbersome paperwork and with little or no need to physically visit various offices or service providers. Some examples include availing Government schemes and crop loans, connecting to agri-input suppliers and buyers of agricultural produce, accessing personalized advisories in real time, etc.

2.  The trustful data would help government agencies make schemes and services more efficient and transparent, such as paperless MSP-based procurement, crop insurance, and credit card-linked crop loans. Further, the digitally captured crop­ sown data and remote-sensing data will help in accurate crop area estimation, crop diversification, and evaluating irrigation needs according to crop and season.

3.  The digital public goods developed under the Mission will also enable the stakeholders in the agriculture ecosystem to establish efficient value chains for agricultural inputs and post-harvest processes.

Key Components of Digital Agriculture Mission

(a) Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for Agriculture, i.e. Agristack, Krishi Decision Support System, Comprehensive Soil Fertility, and Profile Maps.

(b) Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES)

(c) Support to Mahalanobis National Crop Forecasting Centre (MNCFC)

(d) Activities undertaken in erstwhile NeGP- A scheme (subsumed in the Mission) which includes Development & maintenance of IT Infrastructure/Application of DA&FW and Support to States, Academic I Research Institutions for IT initiatives.

AgriStack 

  One of the key components of the Digital Agriculture Mission is to build sector-focused Digital Public Infrastructures. The DPI architecture will engender innovation and development of various applications and solutions by public and private agencies, benefiting around 11 crore farmers in the country. AgriStack is one of the DPls envisioned by the Ministry.

About AgriStack

  Agri Stack is envisaged as a digital public good like "Aadhar" for efficient and effective scheme/service delivery to the farmers. It will be built in a 'federated architecture' as a collaborative project between the various agencies of the Central and State Governments and the Union Territories. It consists of three foundational registries or databases in the agriculture sector, i.e., the Farmers' Registry, Geo-referenced village maps and the Crop Sown Registry, all created and maintained by the State Governments/ Union Territories. Various support registries such as Crop registry, seed registry, fertiliser registry, pest registry etc are also being build. The Agri stack will provide a comprehensive profile of every farmer, irrespective of their primary occupation. By integrating data from various sources, including State databases, farmer registrations, and other Government programs and schemes, it will provide a 360-degree view of a farmer. This will enable the Government to provide services to farmers more transparently and effectively.

Key Features of AgriStack

1.  AgriStack will enable farmers to authenticate their identities, verify assets, and conduct agricultural transactions digitally, enabling them to benefit from agricultural schemes and services without lengthy documentation.

2.  The crop-sown data will provide reliable and timely estimates of crop area.

3.  The Aadhar-verified Farmer ID, linked dynamically to the digitized land records and crops sown, would aid hassle-free procurement of crops at MSP, paperless and contactless crop loans, transparent and efficient crop insurance claims and compensation for crop loss due to natural calamities, personalized services to the farmers for crop planning, agri-input availability, and advisories on pests and diseases.

4.  AgriStack will enable the Government to provide services to farmers more transparently and effectively.

Foundational Registries of AgriStack

  The three (3) foundational registries of AgriStack are elaborated as under:

Farmer's Registry/ Database

  The Farmer's Registry is a dynamic, accurate, and verified database of farmers created and managed by the States/ Union Territories. It will provide comprehensive and useful data on farmers comprising authenticated demographic details, land holdings, family details, crops sown, soil health, livestock owned, fisheries assets, and other vocations.

Geo-referenced Village Maps

  Geo-referencing of village maps is being done under the Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme of the Department of Land Resources (DoLR), Government of India. Geo-referenced Village Maps are required for conducting digital crop surveys. The geo-referenced village maps will enable trustful ground truth data collection and mapping of the data points at the land parcel level during the Digital Crop Survey exercise, geography-based crop advisory system, etc. Survey-level geo-referenced village cadastral maps will serve as a base for the above objectives. Once DoLR completes the Geo-referencing under the Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme, these maps will be used to conduct the Digital Crop Survey.

3.  Crop Sown Registry or database collected through the Digital Crop Survey (DCS) System

  A Digital Crop Survey (DCS) System will be established to collect crop-sown details through a mobile interface, ensuring data is captured directly from the field. This database will provide accurate, real-time crop area information for every agricultural plot, aiming to replace traditional survey methods like Girdawari. The DCS system will also enhance remote sensing capabilities for seamless crop area mapping, reducing the need to conduct surveys in the future.

  The DCS system leverages advanced technologies like visual and advanced analytics, GIS-GPS, and Al/ML to capture accurate and time-stamped crop photos and data verified through physical inspections. A mobile interface ensures data accuracy by capturing it within plots using geo-referenced village maps and GPS. The Centralized Crop Registry standardizes crop identities while allowing states to manage local crop types.

  The Government of India has developed a Reference Mobile Application for conducting the DCS. The application integrates the Land Records of Rights (RoR) data.

Master Advisory for the creation of AgriStack

1.  A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is to be signed between the Centre and State Government to create and implement the Digital Public Infrastructure and develop a mechanism for sharing the data under the Agristack.

2.  State Governments shall authenticate and maintain the State Farmer Registry/Database in accordance with Agri Stack standards.

3.  The State Governments need to ensure that the Farmers Registry contains primary demographic data on farmers (such as name, age, gender, contact information and other details of the farmer as the State may deem fit) with linkage to family members, their lands (including other relationships such as land tenancy or

  sharecropping, as per a State's policy) and more specific details about the farmer's agricultural activities (such as crops produced, area sown, animal rearing, fish farming, etc).

4.  The registry must be dynamically linked to the land records to ensure it is updated with every land mutation.

5.  Reference applications for developing and maintaining the Farmers Registry will be provided by the Central Government. The States can choose any one or both of the following approaches to create their State Farmer Registries:

6.  Direct Registration by the Farmers themselves or with assistance followed by authentication from State Officials

7.  Direct Authentication/validation by State officials through the camps organised at the village level by District Administration.

8.  A unique 11-digit Farmer ID will be generated for each landholding farmer, facilitating nationwide identification and authentication for accessing government schemes and agricultural services.

9.  States must undertake Geo-referencing of village maps separately to conduct the Digital Crop Survey.

10. To carry out the tasks related to AgriStack, the States will set up a State Project Monitoring Unit (SPMU) and Help Desk in accordance with the directions of the Government of India.

Stages of Creation of State Farmers Registry/ Database

  To ensure smooth rollout of the Farmers Registry across all States in India, a structured approach outlining roles, expectations, pre-conditions, and responsibilities is imperative. This includes identifying and training administrative staff at all levels (State, District, and Taluka), conducting proofs of concept, and orienting farmers, farmer services assistants, i.e., Sahayaks, operators, and other individuals and groups. Handbook on creation of Farmer Registry issued by DA&FW is to be referred for detailed process of creating Farmer Registry. However, the 6 Stages recommended for creation of a Farmer's Registry are elaborated in this section.

Stage 1: State's Readiness for Building the Farmers Registry

(a) Once the Central Government's communication regarding the Farmer Registry is received, the State should create an overarching mechanism in the form of a joint committee of Revenue and Agriculture officials to coordinate and collaborate among different stakeholders and facilitate faster decision-making.

(b) To ensure the State's readiness, it is important to identify the State Nodal Officer (preferably from the Revenue Department) and nominate a State Technical Coordinator to facilitate the technical enablement.

(c) State Project Management Units- SPMUs shall act as a bridge between the Centre and the State Teams and district-level officials. They also work closely with the State officials to enable training and system rollout. While the centre provides support resources to work at the State during the initial days of system rollout, it is extremely important that the State Government onboards a PMU team that can enable successful Agri Stack operations and seamless integration with various services/ schemes.

(d) It is critical to give clear administrative direction for data sharing to enable the farmer registry. Creating a Farmers Registry requires sharing Records of Rights (RoR) data through APls. The Central team will provide a utility for the generation of the Farmland Plot ID, also known as the Farm ID, which represents the extent of the land parcel owned by an owner. The State may use this utility as is or customize it to apply the State-specific rules of ownership to generate Farm IDs and assign them to owner extents within every Agricultural Land.

(e) To provide benefits such as KCC and crop insurance, it is essential for the schemes to know the exact extent of land owned by a farmer. For example, in the case of KCC, the banks will refuse the loan unless a farmer's land extent is provided. Agri Stack maintains owner extents provided by states from their RoR for this purpose. Hence, it is vital for the State to take a policy decision on the assignment of land extents to individual farmers explicitly, generate a Farm ID for that extent, and share the same for land bucketing through the unified land API.

(f) Additionally, States must identify schemes where Aadhaar seeding and land linkage of Aadhaar numbers has been done using Demo Authentication, preferably, and eKYC where possible. The data from these schemes can be used to further enrich the Aadhaar seeding of the land buckets.

(g) The majority of the activities are administrative in nature and require decisions at senior level. Hence, it is extremely important that senior State Government officials and the appropriately empowered nodal officer get involved in the decision process and provide their timely and apt approvals.

Stage 2: RoR Data Provisioning

(a) Once the State readiness is complete, to ensure technical readiness, the State Government/ NIC teams should generate the Farmland Plot ID (Farmland Plot Token, Farm ID). To do so, they need to port the ownership data as per the extant allocation policy decision and use the tool provided by the central government or its customized version.

(b) Once the Farm IDs are generated, the State Government/ NIC teams can share the RoR data. The sharing of RoR data is to be done by the State/ NIC Team under the guidance of the Revenue Department. The data is to be shared through an API or ported directly to the State Bucketing Servers provided by the central government.

(c) In addition to RoR data, data from Aadhaar-authenticated scheme systems, which link one or more lands with the Farmer's Aadhaar (such as State DBT data), should also be provisioned to enable the seeding of the buckets with the Farmer's Aadhaar to make the bucket claim process more efficient and accurate.

(d) This bucketing database (SFDB) application is set up to enable the next stage.

(e) Thereafter, Unified Land API is to be created. This API provides owner and owned extent data along with the corresponding Farm ID, from RoR. It is to be ensured that the land API provides all the essential information, including Farm ID which is needed to enable the claiming of land by the owner (Farmer) in Farmer Registry as well as for verification of a bucket claim by a Farmer.

(f)  Agri Stack will utilize the Unified Land API, which will cross-verify the bucket concurrency with the Record of Rights (RoR) database in real time. This will confirm whether a particular piece of land still belongs to a farmer through a simple Yes or No response.

Stage 3: Bucketing

(a) Land bucketing is a concept that creates a pool of all plots owned by a single farmer in a village. The combination of Father Name and Farmer Name is used to identify a Farmer, and all the plots in a particular village owned by the Farmer are populated into a virtual 'bucket' using a bucketing software tool. This bucketing tool uses fuzzy logic to match the names using a Name Match tool developed by CDAC.

(b) The advantage of using a bucket to add lands is two folds:

    i.  A farmer will not need to remember all his lands and claim each one from RoR separately.

    ii. Linking scheme-based Aadhaar from PMFBY/PMKISAN, etc., to the bucket makes it easy for Farmers to claim their Buckets without having to identify their lands. As soon as a farmer does this, Aadhaar seeded buckets are automatically shown to him for claiming.

    iii. The Bucketing process occurs in a Bucketing Database (SFDB) and is done using a bucketing tool. The tool groups the lands belonging to a farmer based on the name match.

    iv. Bucketing, in general, is a very hardware-intensive activity that requires powerful computer processing capacity to run smoothly and complete. It takes around 12 minutes on a high-end server to create buckets in one village. Hence, to cover the data of close to 55,000 villages in a month, one needs to run the tool in parallel on 20 different servers.

    v.  Ideally, the bucketing can be done by the State technical teams themselves, but owing to the capacity constraints, the Centre has a dedicated team to undertake this activity at the direction of the states, where technical team

  and infrastructure are made available for this one-time activity. The decision to use the same is taken by the states.

vi. While bucketing is in progress, State Farmer Registry Web and Mobile Reference Applications for the State are integrated with the unified Land API of the State and kept ready for rolling Farmer Registry claiming software.

vii. Following the completion of the bucketing activity, all the bucket data is migrated to the live State Farmer Registry.

viii. The central team shall work with the State technical teams under the guidance of state officials to configure the Farmer Registry with state­ specific workftow rules, approval structure and user roles.

ix. Using the PMKISAN data, draft Farmer IDs will be created district by district for all Farmers who currently are availing PM KISAN benefits, to shorten the Farmer bucket claiming time and optimize the bucket claim process.

  Guidance for Bucketing

  Bucketing is grouping oflands for a given farmer, which is based on state RoR data. Land bucketing is done centrally, to enable creation ofunique Farmer IDs. The primary objective of creating bucket ids involves a comprehensive matching of farmers' names using a proprietary algorithm. Farmers with matching names (where the name match score is greater than a specified threshold) will be grouped together. Following this grouping, the system will cross-reference these entries with Aadhaar numbers from various government scheme databases. This process ensures the accurate and efficient assignment of Temp FIDs to farmers.

  The process of Temporary Farmer ID creation majorly involves the following after data acquisition:

  1. Applying data cleaning rules to the acquired datasets

  11. Matching the clean data with RoR data on required parameters

  111. Calculating the name match score of the matched data 1v. Generating the draft temporary farmer ID

  v. Populating the Aadhaar from available data sources v1. Generating village-level farmer list.

Stage 4: Field Activity Planning

i.  Technology solution alone does not ensure the success of the Farmer Registry; the entire field activity needs to be planned carefully, as per the State's socio­ political constraints. The planning and preparatory activities are described in the current section.

ii. At the onset, the State needs to identify the districts where they plan to pilot the system first, before going for a State-wide rollout. The selection can be done based upon the accessibility to the district, presence of the right set of officials within the district, presence of crop survey data to enable provisioning of attractive benefits such as the KCC.

(c) Once the districts are identified, the State needs to build a strategy for the campaign. This includes the departments and users who would be involved in the Registry activities, their levels and responsibilities, the locations within the villages where the Farmers' bucket claim and consent would be collected, the type of physical and IT infrastructure needed, the required involvement from various officials and the public, etc.

(d) The Strategy needs to be communicated to the various Stakeholders across levels

  - the communication should include a clear definition of the need, the required involvement and participation from officials, the timeframes and the various help and support that would be rendered to them.

(e) In parallel, the state identifies the Master Trainers, who will understand the system and its operations thoroughly and be responsible for training the District, Sub­ district, and Village officials.

(f) A district-level committee also needs to be formed to effectively coordinate and monitor field farmer ID issuance activities.

(g) The individuals identified as Master trainers are given user training; these officials are then given appropriate access to the training environment, along with the required training material to train the trainers and the officials.

(h)  The production system is then configured for various approval workftow rules; user IDs are created and linked to various district, sub-district, and village-level officials who will participate in the campaign.

Stage 5: Bucket Claiming and Issuance of Farmers ID (Go-Live)

(a) State officials who have been identified and trained on the system will participate in the campaign and enable the bucket claiming and consent of all Farmers across the State. The states may choose to do this exercise in a phased manner, i.e., division by division, district by district, and/or whole state.

(b) The State should design and implement APls tailored to state schemes and AgriStack to integrate them with the Farmer Registry System. These integrations include attractive schemes such as the Kisan Credit Card (KCC), crop insurance, etc. Furthermore, integration testing should be conducted to ensure optimal performance.

(c) A pilot with live farmers needs to be executed for scheme benefit provisioning. After Farmer ID issuance, farmers can be encouraged to apply for these schemes (e.g., KCC) and avail themselves of instant benefits. This benefit availment would encourage a higher level of farmer enrolment in the Farmer Registry.

(d) This pilot can be followed by a Statewide integration with the Schemes that have been successfully piloted.

Stage 6: Sustenance of State Farmer Registry Post-Go-Live

(a) After the go-live stage, a mechanism needs to be established for automatic updation of the Farmer registry with mutation updates done in State RoR. This will ensure that the Farmer registry is live with current and correct records of farmers. (The central team has developed scripts for this purpose, which would enable regular updates of farmland plot data and farmer linkages in RoR.)

(b) The State shall build State-level capacity for the long-term sustenance of the State Farmer Registry.

(c) The Farmer Registry is to be managed and monitored continuously to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness. The State will independently take over its operation and maintenance.

Geo-Referenced Village Maps

1.  The objective of Geo-referenced Village Maps (GRVM) is to establish a comprehensive database of cadastral maps digitally encoded with geographic information system (GIS) technology. Geo-referenced Village Maps are essential for collecting verifiable and truthful crop-sown details in every season through a digital crop survey system. The Department of Land Resources (DoLR), Government of India, is implementing a project to create Unique Land Parcel Identification Numbers (ULPIN) in the country. For this purpose, DoLR is developing geo-referenced village maps under the Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme. Details of the Geo-referenced process have been given on the Department of Land Records (DoLR), Government of India's website.

2.  GRVM involves the creation of GIS-ready digitized maps of revenue village cadastral, encompassing digitization in three layers: point, line, and polygon. The project aims to enable seamless integration with land records, facilitate precise area calculation, and allow for future corrections. The scale and accuracy target is set at 1:4000, ensuring reliability and dimensional accuracy.

3.  The infrastructure for GRVM requires GIS software for digitization and geo­ referencing, high-resolution satellite imagery for spatial accuracy, and IT systems for quality assurance and data integration. The Ministry has developed a mobile application to check the accuracy of Geo-Referencing for the purpose of Digital Crop Surveys. States may use this application to check the accuracy of Geo­ referencing.

Crop Sown Registry through Digital Crop Survey

  The Digital Crop Survey (DCS) enables the capture of crop information for each farmland plot from within the plot's boundary. For conducting the DCS, Central Reference applications are developed, and the States' RoR data is integrated into the application. The system takes farmer and farmland data (from RoR) and Geo-referenced map data to generate a map of owner plots and records the crop sown information against the owner plot. The State Governments would either use the Central Reference Application or the State Application (provided data format is as per the Centre's guidelines) to conduct the DCS in their State with the help of the village-level assistants/ residents/ farmers who act as surveyors, verifiers for performing the crop survey activities.

Objectives of Digital Crop Survey (DCS)

  The DCS is a crucial component of the broader Agri Stack Project, which seeks to digitize and streamline agricultural crop survey processes. The objectives for conducting digital crop survey are:

(a) To support decision-making processes with reliable data, aiding in policy formulation and risk management.

(b) To facilitate access to agricultural services like credit and crop insurance by providing verified details of the farmer's land, the area of the farmland and the crops grown.

(c) Improve soil health management through targeted interventions and promote sustainable agricultural practices.

(d) Facilitate personalized advisories to farmers, helping them make informed decisions.

(e) For accurate crop estimation and providing ground truth information for better market planning and price stabilization.

(f) To create a digitally enabled, resilient agricultural ecosystem in India, benefiting farmers and stakeholders alike.

Time Required for Conducting DCS

  The Digital Crop Survey System is an initiative of the Union Government with the participation of States. The uniqueness of this project, as far as execution is concerned, stems from the fact that the crop survey is a time-limited operation and must be completed within about 45 days from the day of initiation. Generally, a Crop Survey starts in a tehsil/taluka or a village one month after the crop is sown and should be completed about 15 days before the harvest.

  The quantum of work is large in terms of manpower involved. Hence, it is important that the State and central governments make all preparations in tandem when implementing DCS. While the crop survey work will be done entirely by the State Government, it is the responsibility of the Centre to support the State initiative in every possible manner.

Operational Mechanism for Digital Crop Survey

  This section summarizes operational and administrative guidelines and existing advisories shared with the States that have conducted DCS or will conduct DCS in the next cropping season.

Key Pre-requisites for the States on-boarding for DCS

i.  Proposal Submission: States must submit their implementation proposals alongwith Annual Action Plan under Krishnnonati Yojana.

ii. Nodal Officer Nomination: States should appoint a Nodal Officer to lead DCS implementation and facilitate coordination with the Centre.

iii. Master Trainers Identification: States must identify Master Trainers for each district, with action []an for training.

iv. IT System Preparation:Essential IT infrastructure must be in [] ace two weeks

  before the DCS start date. This includes SSL certificates, bandwidth, and storage requirements.

Operational Mechanism

i.  States must geo-reference village maps and digitize land records (RoR) before conducting digital crop surveys.

ii. Surveys will be conducted for each agricultural plot once per season (Kharif, Rabi, and Summer, if ap[]icable).

iii. Data will be captured using a Digital Crop Survey Mobile App, which will be shared

  between the Centre and the State as per the MoU signed on Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). Data will also be shared with State Agricultural Statistics Authority (SASA) for Crop Area Estimation.

iv. As per MoU, State will share following data with the Centre w.r.t. DCS through API:

    a.  Village level aggregated DCS data for crop area estimation.

    b.  Parcel level crop data for service/ scheme delivery to farmers.

    c.  Anonymized parcel level crop data for Geo-spatial use.

v.  States can use Government officials or Krishi Sakhis or private persons, including farmers, for the surveys, ensuring they are knowledgeable about local agronomy.

vi. Surveyors will log in to the DCS mobile app and access assigned surveys and land parcels for which data is to be recorded. The mobile app uses GPS to locate surveyors within designated land parcel boundaries, ensuring accurate data capture within the specified survey area.

vii. Surveyors will visit each plot, using the mobile application to capture crop details, irrigation sources, etc., geo-tagged and time-stamped photographs, and cropped areas.

viii. The Principal Secretary/ Director (Agriculture/Revenue), as designated by the State will be the Single Point of Contact (SPOC), and a Technical Nodal Officer (TNO) will be appointed for technical oversight. SASA officials are to be involved for supervision & other related activities of conducting DCS. A web portal allows supervisors to review survey details captured by surveyors, ensuring data accuracy and completeness before submission.

Stakeholder's Roles and Responsibilities

(a) Central Government

  The Central Government will provide a draft of recommended roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder involved in the project. This includes State and local officials such as the State Chief Secretary, State Development Commissioner, State Revenue Secretary, State Agriculture Secretary, Collector/Deputy Commissioners, Tehsildars, Agriculture Officers, Taluka Agriculture Officers, Village Agriculture Officers, and Village Accountants/Patwaris.

  The successful execution of the Digital Crop Survey (DCS) requires the Central Government to undertake several key responsibilities. These responsibilities are categorized under IT System Preparations and Manpower and Training.

IT System preparation

- Crop Survey Mobile and Web Application: States can use their own apps after incorporating mandatory features or the central app provided by the Ministry. States need to configure the Reference app with parameters such as the start and end of the season and Taluka names. Additionally, States must link their land records and georeferenced maps to the Crop Survey Application. The Centre will provide documentation and support for this integration.

- User Manual: The Central Government will supply a user manual in English, and States are responsible for translating it into the local/official language.

- Training Documents: The Central Government will prepare training materials (videos, PPTs, manuals) in English. States must translate these materials and distribute them to all concerned parties.

  guide the number and roles of master trainers, and representatives will visit States to assist with their training.

- District Trainers: District trainers support crop surveyors and supervisors and helping resolve issues during the 45-day survey period. Each district trainer should oversee no more than 20 surveyors to ensure effective management.

Setting up the State PMU (SPMU)

  The Digital Crop Survey (DCS) is a significant initiative designed to survey crores of agricultural []ots across all villages in a State within a tight timeframe of about 45 days. This large-scale operation requires simultaneous surveying in numerous villages, ranging from 20,000 to over 1,00,000 per state. To achieve this, an extensive

  number of crop surveyors are needed, ideally one per village, drawing personnel from various government departments, including Revenue, Panchayati Raj, Agriculture, Horticulture, Sericulture, and Animal Husbandry. The survey may also involve local youth under the supervision of these officials, necessitating substantial inter­ departmental collaboration. The successful execution of this project involves addressing numerous administrative issues and ensuring effective coordination among the departments, which is managed by the State Project Monitoring Unit (SPMU).

  The SPMU plays a central role in the DCS and the Farmers Registry, overseeing daily operations, resolving software and data quality issues, and ensuring timely communication and problem-solving among field officials and crop surveyors. It comprises a Project Head, supported by officers from different departments, domain experts, an IT consultant, and administrative staff. The Project Head is responsible for high-level supervision and reporting to senior government officials. The PMU also organizes State Level Committee meetings and ensures that surveyors receive their honorarium promptly. Unlike the Help Desk, which provides day-to-day technical support for field operations, the SPMU controls and supervises Help Desk activities.

  The SPMU's services, set up for the Farmers' Registry with administrative funds under PM KISAN, may also be utilized for DCS.

vii. Liaison with Officers: Gather feedback and relay it to the department head.

viii. Coordination and Mediation: Facilitate communication between the Help Desk, Development Team, and department officers.

Helpdesk

  The Help Desk is designed to provide timely information and resolve issues that arise during the Crop Survey. It aims to address queries from farmers, surveyors, and government officials within 5-15 minutes of registration. The DCS Helpdesk advisory has the following salient features.

Roles and Responsibilities of the Helpdesk

  The Help Desk team supports the Crop Survey Application through various activities, using CRM software to manage and allocate incoming calls. Key responsibilities include:

i.  Application Guidance: Provide step-by-step guidance and assistance to users.

ii. Remote Support: Utilize tools like Team Viewer or any desk to offer remote support.

iii. []rtual Training: Conduct training sessions to enhance user proficiency.

iv. Account Management: Manage user accounts, enabling or disabling them as needed.

v.  Device Compatibility: Ensure mobile devices are compatible with the ap[] ication and guide users on necessary settings.

vi. Application Settings: Assist with downloading, installing, and configuring the application.

vii. Data Download: Help surveyors download essential master data.

viii. Training on New Requirements: Conduct sessions on new features and functionalities.

ix. Escalation to Technical Support: Forward unresolved issues to the Technical Support Team.

x.  Data Gathering: Collect information on defective village maps for further analysis.

Helpdesk Structure

  The Help Desk consists of:

i.  Tele-executive Operators: To interact with users, provide guidance, and resolve issues promptly.

ii. Team Leaders/Managers: To oversee operations, monitor performance, and

  provide training and support

iii. Subject Matter Experts: To offer advanced knowledge and solutions for specialized issues.

iv. State Technical Support Team: This team addresses technical problems, assists

  with data backup, verifies village maps, and supports web ap[] ications.

Krishi Decision Support System {Krishi-DSS) 

About Krishi - DSS

  Krishi-DSS, launched on 16th August 2024, integrates and standardizes geospatial and non-geospatial data, including satellite, weather, soil, crop signatures, reservoir, groundwater data, and government scheme information. Krishi-DSS offers crop maps, soil maps, automated yield estimation models, drought/flood monitoring systems, etc., which support the government's evidence-based decision-making and facilitate innovative solutions by research institutions and the agritech industry. This Krishi-DSS platform is aligned with the government's National Geo-Spatial policy. The information available on Krishi-DSS would support crop map generation for identifying crop sown patterns and crop diversification, drought/flood monitoring, and technology/model-based yield assessment for settling crop insurance claims by farmers.

Collaborative Approach for Krishi Decision Support System

  Krishi Decision Support System (Krishi- DSS) is a prime example of a collaborative platform that follows the whole government approach with participation from multiple Ministries, Departments, and organizations, where multiple data sources are seamlessly exchanged to enhance agricultural decision-making. This system integrates a wide array of data types, including weather information/forecasts, soil information, satellite imageries, reservoir levels, groundwater data, Field information, etc. These datasets are sourced from various organizations - Weather data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMO); Reservoir levels and groundwater data from the National Water Informatics Centre (NWIC) of the Department of Water Resources, RD & GR; Soil data from Soil and Land Use Survey of India (SLUSI); and Field information collected by MNCFC, DA&FW and the State agencies. Open-source satellite imageries are also integrated into the platform.

  Collaboration has been done with the Space Application Center (SAC), Ahmedabad, for the implementation of Crop yield models and drought Modules through Krishi-DSS. SLUSI has been involved in developing a soil-related module on K-DSS. The WINDS platform, which is being developed in association with IMO for weather-related information, will also be integrated into Krishi-DSS.

  Through its advanced modular architecture, Krishi DSS facilitates the continuous exchange of these diverse data sets, which are processed and analyzed to generate actionable insights for farmers, researchers, and policymakers. The collaborative nature of Krishi DSS is evident in its ability to consolidate and harmonize data from disparate sources into a unified platform. The system includes modules for crop monitoring, yield estimation, insurance solutions, and advisory services.

Operational Mechanism for Krishi Decision Support System (Krishi­ DSS)

1.  Data Integration and Accessibility: Krishi DSS integrates data from central, state, and research/institutes, providing different access levels based on the data's sensitivity. There are three access levels: A1 (Central data open access), A2 (State-specific data with limited access), and A3 (Central and State data with restricted access).

2.  User Groups and Privileges: Different user groups will have varying access levels. Farmers can access farm-specific data, while government officials will have access to aggregated data.

3.  Training and Capacity Building: After deployment, state and central employees will receive training to utilize the Krishi DSS effectively. This includes hands-on training on the software's functionality and processes.

4.  Collaborative and Secure Framework: The platform will allow for collaborative decision-making and, with strict data security and privacy measures, integrate with various data sources for seamless data flow and management.

2.  A Strategic PMU consisting of resources with requisite expertise shall be established at MNCFC to oversee the development and monitor the functioning of Krishi DSS.

3.  The States are advised to set up PMUs at the state level for operations, maintenance and utilisation of the Krishi-DSS platform.

Role of the State Governments

  An integrated agriculture platform that includes a decision support system is being built by the Centre to serve as a reliable system for agricultural-related applications. The States may use the reference application and refer to the standard operating procedure for developing and utilising the standardized data available in Krishi-DSS. States will be given access to Krishi-DSS where states may customize the rules and APls or build their own, ensuring essential features prescribed by the Central Government.

National Soil Mapping Programme {NSMP) 

About the Project

1.  A Nationwide Soil Resource Mapping project has been initiated by the Soil and Land Use Survey of India (SLUSI), which is inventorying soils at a village level on a finer and more detailed 1:10,000 scale using high-resolution satellite and ground data. Under this project, a detailed soil profile study will be carried out to create standardized soil maps for rational land use and crop planning, thus promoting sustainable agriculture.

2.  Presently, SLUSI, with 52 soil survey parties spread across the country, has the capacity to survey and map about 10 m ha of land annually. Each soil survey party can survey about 1.5 to 2.0 lakh acres annually, depending on the terrain/study area. For the execution of this project, the soil survey, remote sensing, GIS, and soil analysis lab facility of SLUSI needs to be further strengthened and augmented.

Key objectives of the project include the following:

(a) To prepare a detailed soil resource inventory of the country's agricultural lands on a 1:10,000 scale at the village level for soil health management, sustainable agriculture and crop planning.

(b) To carry out a detailed soil survey and soil profile study of the soils of India for their characterization, classification (based on universally accepted taxonomy), mapping, and interpretation for rational land use planning using remote sensing, GIS techniques, ground survey, and soil analysis.

(c) To build a digital soil resource database useful for Decision Support System in Agriculture (Krishi-DSS) as a part of the development of a Digital Agriculture Ecosystem in the country for the benefit of farmers, policymakers, academia and researchers.

Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES) 

About DGCES

1.  Crop statistics information is the backbone of the Agricultural Statistical System. The availability of reliable and timely crop estimates is crucial for importantpolicy decisions on pricing, procurement, storage, transportation, marketing, export/ import, public distribution, and compilation of GVA in the country.

2.  There are two components in crop statistics. First is crop area, and the second is crop yield. The crop area statistics is product of official statistics generated out of Land Record system and is primarily maintained by State Revenue Departments. The crop-wise area submitted by the States/UTs during Kharif & Rabi seasons, as per schedule of release of advance and final estimates, is aggregated and validated to arrive at National level figures of area sown of major crops. Crop­ wise yield is estimated through a national programme called General Crop Estimation Surveys (GCES). Under GCES, Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) are conducted by States/UTs using a scientifically proved sampling methodology. Under GCES, the CCEs are conducted in randomly selected fields by randomly locating a plot of a specified size, harvesting, threshing, weighing and recording the weight of the produce from the plot. The State governments are responsible for collecting the agricultural data and implementing sample surveys for yield estimation through GCES.

3.  Previously, the process of recording and generating yield estimates was completely manual in States/ UTs except for a few States, resulting in delays and manual errors. This led to the introduction of Digital General Crop Estimation Surveys (DGCES). DGCES has re-engineered the existing process of General Crop estimation survey (GCES) with an infusion of advanced technologies to improve the quality of crop-cutting experiment data and enhance the accuracy of crop yield estimation. DGCES aims to standardize the CCEs across the country

  using a digital platform to achieve:

(a) Improved data quality and accuracy of CCEs

(b) Robust and real-time monitoring of the process

(c) Real-time data analysis and Yield estimation

4.  DGCES is designed to streamline and automate the entire GCES process, encompassing state-level planning, recording the results of CCEs conducted on the field, and report generation. By digitizing and enhancing the efficiency of CCEs, DGCES seeks to provide States/ UTs with crop yield data that is not only accurate but also accessible in a timely manner.

5.  DGCES was pilot implemented during Kharif 2023 in selected districts of 10 States: Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, and Bihar. In Rabi 2024, it was implemented in all districts of 16 major States. From Kharif 2024, DGCES will be rolled out in all the major States/UTs of India.

Infrastructure

1.  The Ministry will provide a DGCES mobile application for recording CCE results directly from the field, along with a DGCES web portal.

2.  Registration of primary workers, crop-wise and season wise CCE plan upload/ generation, crop area upload, implementation progress tracking and data approval etc. need to be done through the web-portal. DGCES mobile application will be used primarily for CCE data collection by the primary workers.

3.  Implementing states, during each crop season, are required to generate/ upload the CCE Plan exclusively as per the methodology of GCES on the Web Portal well within the prescribed time. This will facilitate primary workers and States/UTs getting the relevant information on time. The registration of primary workers is a one-time exercise. However, modification can be done in case of transfer and posting of primary workers.

4.  States that have developed their own CCE applications under GCES may either opt to use the DGCES mobile and web portal provided by the Ministry or continue using their own applications. However, in either case, the States must ensure that their CCE applications include the essential features prescribed by the Ministry (Annexure-II).This may be modified as per requirement. A team from the Ministry will facilitate a thorough demonstration of the State/UTs own application.

Operational Mechanism

1.  The departments designated as the State Agricultural Statistical Authority (SASA) in each State or Union Territory shall serve as the nodal departments for implementing and coordinating Digital GCES in their respective States.

2.  If multiple departments are involved in conducting CCEs within a state, SASAs must ensure effective coordination and collaboration among them to facilitate the smooth and efficient implementation of DGCES at the ground level.

3.  States must prepare a Crop Cutting Experiment (CCE) plan for all major and minor agricultural crops cultivated within their State at the start of each season for the agricultural year, strictly adhering to the GCES methodology as prescribed by the Department of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare. The CCE plan should be entered into the DGCES web portal at the beginning of each season.

4.  States shall ensure that CCEs planned under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) or any other crop insurance scheme are kept separate from those conducted under DGCES.

5.  The Ministry will notify States of the minimum number of CCEs required per crop before generating plans through the DGCES Portal for each agricultural year. SASAs must ensure that at least the specified number of CCEs is planned for each crop.

6.  SASAs and the departments responsible for conducting CCEs must approve the CCE data submitted by primary workers for all seasons of every agricultural year via the DGCES web portal preferably within 10 days of submission. CCE data can be approved through the portal's 'Data Approval Module', and both district and

  state-level users may approve the CCEs.

7.  Before approval, SASAs must verify the accuracy of the data submitted by primary workers. They may correct data in specific fields, provided they include justifications and upload supporting documents.
