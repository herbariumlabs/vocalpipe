  Recently, on the occasion of the release of the 19^(th) instalment of PM-KISAN in Bhagalpur, Bihar, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched the 10,000th FPO. The 10,000^(th) FPO has been registered in Khagaria district and focuses on maize, banana, and paddy.

  farmers in the country are connected to FPOs, with around 40 percent of them being women. These FPOs are now conducting business worth thousands of crores in the agricultural sector.³

  Under this scheme, there is a provision for handholding support for a period of five years to each new FPO formed, and financial assistance to the tune of Rs.18 lakhs to each FPO under the scheme towards management cost for 3 years. Additionally, matching equity grant upto Rs. 2,000 per farmer member of FPO with a limit of Rs. 15.00 lakh per FPO and a credit guarantee facility upto Rs. 2 crore of project loan per FPO from eligible lending institutions to ensure institutional credit accessibility to FPOs⁴

  What are FPOs?

  Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) is a generic name, which refers to farmer- producers’ organization incorporated/ registered either under Part IXA of Companies Act or under Co-operative Societies Act of the concerned States and formed for the purpose of leveraging collectives through economies of scale in production and marketing of agricultural and allied sector.

  The concept behind Farmer Producer Organizations is that farmers, who are the producers of agricultural products, can form groups. To facilitate this process, the Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) was mandated by Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of India, to support the State Governments in the formation of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).⁵

  The “Formation and Promotion of 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)” scheme was launched with the main focus on leveraging economies of scale in production and marketing with a view to enhance productivity through efficient, cost effective and sustainable resource use for ensuring

  sustainable income-oriented farming, thus helping in reduction of cost of farm production and increase in farmers’ income.⁶

Need for FPOs

- FPOs help in collectivization of such small, marginal and landless farmers in order to give them the collective strength to deal with such issues. Members of the FPO will manage their activities together in the organization to get better access to technology, input, finance and market for faster enhancement of their income.⁷

- They also face tremendous challenges in marketing their produce due to lack of economic strength.

- Small, marginal and landless farmers face tremendous challenges during agriculture production phase such as for access to technology, quality seed, fertilizers and pesticides including requisite finances.

  OBJECTIVES

i.  To provide holistic and broad-based supportive ecosystem to form 10000 new FPOs to facilitate development of vibrant and sustainable income-oriented farming and for overall socio-economic development and wellbeing of agrarian communities.

ii. To enhance productivity through efficient, cost-effective and sustainable resource use and realize higher returns through better liquidity and market linkages for their produce and become sustainable through collective action.

iii. To provide handholding and support to new FPOs up to five years from the year of its creation in all aspects of management of FPO, inputs, production, processing and value addition, market linkages, credit linkages and use of technology etc.

iv. To provide effective capacity building to FPOs to develop agriculture entrepreneurship skills to become economically viable and self-sustaining beyond the period of support from the government.⁸

  Services and Activities undertaken by FPOs

  The FPOs provide and undertake following relevant major services and activities for their development:

1.  Supply quality production inputs like seed, fertilizer, pesticides and such other inputs at reasonably lower wholesale rates

2.  Make available need-based production and post-production machinery and equipment like cultivator, tiller, sprinkler set, combine harvester and such other machinery and equipment on custom hiring basis for members to reduce the per 2 unit production cost

3.  Make available value addition like cleaning, assaying, sorting, grading, packing and also farm level processing facilities at user charge basis on reasonably cheaper rate. Storage and transportation facilities may also be made available

4.  Undertake higher income generating activities like seed production, bee keeping, mushroom cultivation etc

5.  Undertake aggregation of smaller lots of farmer-members’ produce; add value to make them more marketable

6.  Facilitate market information about the produce for judicious decision in production and marketing

8.  Market the aggregated produce with better negotiation strength to the buyers and in the marketing channels offering better and remunerative prices¹⁹

  Initiatives under the scheme

  Credit Guarantee Fund: FPOs need finance, both grants and loans, to quickly establish input collectivisation, working capital, marketing and improved services to member farmers. Considering FPOs' need for credit from formal financial institutions, a dedicated Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF) has been created under the Central Sector Scheme for Formation and Promotion of 10,000 FPOs. CGF provides credit guarantee cover to financial institutions for extending loans to FPOs.²⁰

  ONDC platform: Almost 5 thousand out of 8,000 registered Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) have been registered on Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) portal for selling the produce online to consumers across the country. The onboarding of FPOs on ONDC to reach out to their buyers in any part of the country is in line with the Central government objective of providing growers with

  better market access. The move aims to empower FPOs with direct access to digital marketing, online payment, business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions.²¹

  MoU to convert 10,000 FPOs into CSCs: An MoU between CSC SPV (Common Services Centres Special Purpose Vehicle) and Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer's Welfare was signed to convert FPOs registered under ‘Formation & Promotion of 10,000 FPOs scheme’ into CSCs and help them to deliver citizen-centric services. As per the MoU, 10,000 FPOs will be converted into CSCs. CSC SPV will enable them to provide the services that are available on the Digital Seva Portal. The delivery of CSC services through FPOs is aimed at increasing employment opportunities in rural areas.²²

  Conclusion

  Formation & promotion of FPOs is the first step for converting Krishi into Atmanirbhar Krishi. The successful formation of 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) under the Central Sector Scheme marks a transformative milestone for the agriculture sector. By fostering collectivization, enhancing market access, and providing financial and institutional support, this initiative has empowered millions of small and marginal farmers, including women and economically weaker sections. This achievement not only boosts agricultural productivity and income but also contributes to rural job creation and economic resilience. As India moves forward, the continued support and expansion of FPOs will be instrumental in shaping a self-reliant, efficient, and prosperous agricultural ecosystem.
