Guidelines for implementation of Seed Capital component of PM FME Scheme

Context

1.  Ministry of Food Processing Industry (MoFPI) has launched Prime Minister Formalisation of Micro food processing Enterprises (PM FME) scheme under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan with the aim to enhance the competitiveness of existing individual micro-enterprises in the unorganized segment of the food processing industry and promote formalization of the sector. The scheme to be implemented over a period five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25 with a total outlay of Rupees 10,000 crore. The scheme has a special focus on supporting Groups engaged in Agri-food processing such as Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), Self Help Groups (SHGs) and Producers Cooperatives along their entire value chain. The PMFME scheme support in terms of:

i.  Seed capital @ Rs. 40,000/- per SHG member for working capital and purchase of small tools

ii. Food processing entrepreneurs through credit-linked capital subsidy@35% of the eligible project cost with a maximum ceiling of Rs.10 lakh per unit

iii. Credit linked grant of 35% for capital investment to FPOs/ SHGs/ producer

  cooperatives.

iv. Support for marketing & branding to micro units

    1.  Under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), financial and handholding supports are extended to SHGs, their Federation at village and Cluster level. SHG members are being supported for various livelihood interventions in farm and non-farm sectors. Under the non-farm livelihoods space, a large number of enterprises in the food processing sector are supported. As on July 2020, 63.39 lakh SHGs have been formed covering 697.57 lakh households. In the context of implementation of PM FME scheme, the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) and Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) have agreed to work together to ensure that SHG members are facilitated to avail the benefits under the scheme. The designated State Nodal Agencies (SNAs) appointed by the State Governments for this scheme and State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs) under DAY- NRLM would work closely for providing scheme benefits to the target beneficiaries.
