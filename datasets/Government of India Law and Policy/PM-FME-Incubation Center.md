Revised Guidelines for Establishment of Incubation Center under PMFME Scheme

1.  Background

  Establishment of Incubation Center based on One District One Product (ODOP) is one of the important components of PMFME Scheme. The scheme envisages providing credit support to 2 lakh existing unorganized micro-food processing enterprises. Through this scheme the micro entrepreneurs/SHGs/FPOs/Cooperatives and groups can utilize this Incubation Center to manufacture their products without capital investment. In addition, this Incubation Center will be utilized to provide training and skill upgradation support to the beneficiaries.

  1.2 The raw materials will be converted into finished product by utilizing the primary/ secondary/Tertiary processing and auxiliary units that will be set up at this Incubation Center. This facility aids in overcoming the financial burdens on capital investment of start- ups and also supports the existing entrepreneurs to venture into product extension lines. In short, this facility renders machinery support required for conversion of produce from farm to fork.

Objectives

i.  To support establishment of Incubation Center for ODOP andother products

ii. To utilize the Incubation Center on commercial basis

iii. To provide training to beneficiaries (micro entrepreneurs/ SHGs/FPOs/Cooperatives and groups) through Incubation Centers at the training rates prescribed under PMFME Schemebased on National Skill Framework

Salient features of Incubation Center

  The scheme under its Incubation Center would provide the following support

iv. Primary processing facility like cleaning, grading and packaging of raw produce

v.  Secondary processing facilities like milling, flaking, minimal processing, thermal processing, brining and so on

vi. Tertiary processing like processing of Ready to eat, Ready to serve, Ready to cook and so on

vii. Cold storage facilities to store their fresh and processed produce

viii. Re-packing of foods

ix. Supports product extension lines

Components of schemes

  As per the main PMFME scheme, One District One Product (ODOP) approach is adopted in order to reap the benefit of scale in terms of procurement of inputs, availing common services and marketing of products. Based on the baseline study, the state

  governments have identified a food product for a district, keeping in view of the schemeon perishables, cereal based product or a food product widely produced in a district and their allied sectors. Shortlisted ODOPs from the state government have been pooledtogether and the food produce has been grouped into 11 categories as given below including minor forest produce for tribal districts.

i.  Food products based on Food Grains (Rice, Wheat &Pulses)

ii. Oil seeds based products

iii. Millets based products

iv. Fruits based products

v.  Vegetables & Tuber Crops related products

vi. Fish and marine products

vii. Meat/Poultry products

viii. Dairy products

ix. Spice products

x.  Plantation crops based products (including coconut andsugar cane)

xi. Minor forest produce (targeting the tribal population)

Incubation Center

  Incubation Center shall be the processing cum incubation facility based on ODOP along with 2-4 allied product lines. The Incubation Center should have a minimum three processing lines and maximum five processing lines to be funded from PMFME Scheme. The Incubation Center will be made available for the end users on custom hiring basis for startups and smaller food processing units. But it should run on commercial basisfor full utilization of installed capacity. The Incubation Center shall have the complete processing lines as per the standard norms. The space/area for any Incubation Centers should be minimum 7000 Sq. ft.

Host Institute

  The identified institutes where the Incubation Center to be established is named as Host Institute. Any government owned institutions or govt. funded autonomousInstitutions such as technical colleges, universities, other professional institutes, R&D institutes or any private institutions/agencies shall be the host institute. The concerned state government/nodal agency shall identify the host institute and location for establishingthe Incubation Center. The institutes which is having existing building shall be given preference for hosting Incubation Center.

Cost norms for setting up Incubation Center

  Each selected host institute will be funded for the following to establish the IncubationCenter
