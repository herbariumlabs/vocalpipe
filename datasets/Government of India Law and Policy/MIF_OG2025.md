  Operational Guidelines of Micro Irrigation Fund (MIF)

Introduction

1.  Water being the most critical input for agriculture, its judicious use is important to ensure sustainable agricultural development and food security. There is a need for adopting optimum cropping pattern and efficient water application that utilises available water resources in an efficient manner. The saving of water will not only help in improving soil health, enhancing productivity and providing environmental advantage, but also in supporting irrigation with extended coverage for a longer duration from the same source of water.

2.  The water use efficiency of protective irrigation sources through small water harvesting structures in rainfed areas can be enhanced by integrating them to micro- irrigation systems and provide life saving irrigation to the standing crop. Micro irrigation techniques not only help in water saving but also in reducing fertilizer usage, labour expenses, and other inputs and input costs, besides sustaining soil health. Micro- irrigation systems deliver water savings of upto 40 per cent over conventional flood irrigation methods, along with appreciable crop productivity and income enhancement.

3.  Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DA&FW) has been playing a leading role since VIII Plan for the promotion of improved irrigation methods like drip and sprinkler irrigation. DA&FW launched centrally sponsored scheme on Micro Irrigation in 2005-06, which was subsequently converted as National Mission on Micro Irrigation in 2010-11. During 2014-15, the scheme was subsumed as On-Farm Water Management component of National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and further subsumed under Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in the year 2015-16. During 2015-16 to 2021-22, PDMC was implemented under PMKSY. From the year 2022-23, the scheme is being implemented under the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (PM-RKVY).

4.  With a view to provide impetus to the micro irrigation, in the Union Budget 2017-18, Hon’ble Finance Minister announced setting up of a dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund (MIF) with NABARD with an initial corpus of Rs. 5000 crore. Accordingly, Micro Irrigation Fund was set up in 2018-19 to facilitate the States to mobilize additional resources for expanding coverage of Micro Irrigation. This fund has been augmented by another Rs.5000 Crores pursuant to Hon’ble Finance Minister’s announcement in the

  Budget Speech 2021-22 with the approval of Union Cabinet in its meeting held on 3rd

  October, 2024.

Rationale

1.  The Task Force on Micro Irrigation had estimated a potential of 69.6 m ha for coverage under micro irrigation. MIF would facilitate the States/UTs in augmenting their resources to provide top-up subsidy as well as to take up innovative projects on micro irrigation which would help in covering more area under micro irrigation. The additional funds of Rs.5000 Crores would help in further accelerating the pace of coverage of area under micro irrigation.

2.  It is observed that while Western and Southern States use substantial portion of the allocated amount under PDMC Scheme, remaining States particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, Eastern and North-Eastern regions are not availing adequate benefits from the programme.

3.  Farmers in States with high MI coverage are mainly encouraged by offering an additional (Top up) subsidy by these States, in addition to the subsidy available under the PDMC Scheme. With the operationalization of MIF, it is expected that the States/UTs which are lagging behind, would also be encouraged to promote micro irrigation on a larger scale in the line of better performing States.

4.  There is also a need to cover more area with micro irrigation in irrigation commands to improve water use efficiency for bringing additional area under assured irrigation and enable water availability to tail- end farmers.

Objective

  The main objective of the fund is to facilitate States/UTs in mobilising theresources for expanding coverage of Micro Irrigation by taking up special and innovative projects and also for incentivising micro irrigation beyond the provisions available under PDMC to encourage farmers to install micro irrigation systems.

Strategy for implementation of Micro Irrigation Fund (MIF)

1.  MIF would not only facilitate States/UTs in incentivising and mobilizing resources for achieving the target envisaged under PDMC but also in bringing additional coverage through special and innovative initiatives by State/UT Governments/Administration.

2.  The fund is to be accessed by the State/UT Government/Administration and not by individual farmers.

3.  States/UTs may access MIF for incentivising micro irrigation through an additional (top up) subsidy over and above the one available under PDMC Guidelines for achieving the target. The proposal for this purpose should clearly indicate the details of the approved Annual Action Plan of PDMC and extent of fund required under MIF for top up subsidy.

4.  The MIF should not be a substitute for State’s share in PDMC.

5.  States/UTs may access MIF exclusively for innovative integrated projects (such as high water duty crops like sugarcane/solar linked systems/ Micro irrigation in PPIC/ commands etc.) including projects in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode depending on State/UT’s specific requirements. The project proposal should clearly indicate the component/activity wise source of funding viz. MIF/State/UT Government/PDMC/Farmers’ share and convergence, if any, from other programmes/schemes of GoI/State Government.

6.  Coverage of more area with micro irrigation in irrigation command to improve water use efficiency and bring additional area under assured irrigation is also need of the hour. MIF may be accessed for taking up such projects in commands, wherever necessary.

7.  Farmers Producers Organizations (FPOs)/ Cooperatives/ Water User Associations (WUAs)/ State Level Agencies can also access the funds with State/UT Government Guarantee or equivalent collateral in the alternate.These organizations may access this fund for innovative cluster based Community Irrigation projects for Micro irrigation coverage. The cluster size would be preferably 20 ha or more in North Eastern & Himalayan States and 50 ha or more in other States. The general procedure for accessing MIF is prescribed in Para 5.1 of the Operational Guidelines.

8.  For better implementation of the programme, States/UTs should ensure assured energy support for installation of MI.

9.  Borrowings from NABARD shall be paid back in 7 years including the moratorium period of 2 years. The State/UT Government/Administration shall repay the loan to NABARD as per the instructions as specified in the Terms

  and conditions of the Sanction letter and disbursement advice issued by NABARD.

10. To keep the borrowing under MIF attractive for the State/UT Governments/Administration, NABARD shall lend at 2% lower interest rate than the corresponding cost of funds mobilized by NABARD from the market. The cost of fund shall include the rate at which NABARD borrows from the market and NABARD’s margin of 0.60 p.a. Else, the cost of funds shall be the FIMMDA rate applicable to AAA rated PSU entities for equivalent tenor, observable on FIMMDA website on one day prior to the date of disbursement plus NABARD’s margin of 0.60%. The interest subvention amount shall be paid to NABARD on annual/periodical basis by Government of India @ 3% on the amount already sanctioned and disbursed. However, interest subvention by Government of India would be 2% on the loan amount which has been sanctioned but not disbursed as well as the amount which may be sanctioned in future to States/UTs. The expenditure on interest subvention to be paid by Government of India shall be met from the ongoing scheme of PDMC under PM-RKVY with provisioning of appropriate Budget head.

11. The loan amount shall be given to States/UTs in a perspective manner for the purpose which it has been sanctioned.

12. Technical requirements/ standards, cost norms etc. for various activities/interventions involved in projects/proposals will be as per the existing Operational Guidelines of Per Drop More Crop. For additional activities/interventions involved in formulation and implementation of projects

  /proposals, not covered therein, concerned subject matter scheme Guidelines of Government of India will be followed for technical requirements/ standards, cost norms etc.

13. While formulating innovative proposals under MIF, it shall be ensured that Micro Irrigation activity is the major component of the proposal.

14. The company must provide free after sales service to the farmers for three years from the date of installation of system.

15. While preparing the Proposals/Projects, due priority should be given to small and marginal farmers in selection of beneficiaries and wherever possible, Operational Guidelines of PDMC should be adopted.

WHEREAS

1.  Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched on 1st July 2015 with the motto of ‘Har Khet ko Pani’ for providing end to end solutions in irrigation supply chain, viz., water resources, distribution network, farm level applications and improving water use efficiency. The Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare implemented the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) in the country as a component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) from the year 2015-16 to 2021-22. From the year 2022-23, the PDMC scheme is being implemented under Pradhan Mantri-Rastriya Krishi Vikas Yojna (PM-RKVY). PDMC scheme focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation, namely, Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation systems.

2.  With a view to provide impetus to the micro irrigation, the Union Finance Minister, in his Budget Speech 2017-18, announced a dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund (MIF) to be instituted with NABARD with an initial corpus of ₹5000 crore for encouraging public and private investments in modern irrigation methods such as sprinkler and drip irrigation as also water use enhancing practices to realize the objective of per drop more crop.

3.  The main objective of MIF was to facilitate the States/UTs in mobilizing resources for expanding coverage of micro irrigation, by taking up special and innovative integrated projects, including projects in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode as also for incentivizing micro irrigation through an additional (top-up) subsidy, beyond the provisions available under PDMC Scheme, for covering additional areas.

4.  As per the Budget Announcement of the Government of India, NABARD was assigned the task of hosting and administering MIF and extending credit support from MIF to State Government and in accordance with the Terms of Reference on MIF (including the modifications thereto) finalized by GoI, NABARD and State Government/Union Territory through mutual consultations and in accordance with CCEA approval. NABARD has since agreed to host and administer MIF. The Terms of Reference for loan from NABARD to State Governments/Union Territories from MIF and any modification thereto shall be read as part and parcel of the MoA.

5.  The State Government/Union Territories shall avail loan from NABARD out of MIF for the eligible projects, as per their requirement.

6.  Union Cabinet in its meeting dated 03.10.2024 has approved the proposal of Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare for continuation and rationalization of the PM-RKVY (including the MIF) and Krishonnati Yojana. The continuation and augmentation of the MIF by another ₹5000 crore has also been approved during 15th Finance Commission period, as part of the proposal. Further, the interest subvention by GoI is now 2% instead of earlier 3%.
