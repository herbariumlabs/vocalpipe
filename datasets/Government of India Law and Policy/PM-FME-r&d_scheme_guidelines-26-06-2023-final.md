1.  INTRODUCTION

  The Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) extends financial assistance as grant-in-aid to various institutions/ universities, Public funded organizations and recognized R&D laboratories both in public and private sector, to promote and undertake demand driven R&D work in the Food Processing Sector for product and process development, design and development of equipment, improved storage, shelf-life, packaging etc.

  From 1^(st) April, 2017 onwards, the scheme is being implemented directly by the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Panchsheel Bhawan, August Kranti Marg, New Delhi – 110049.

OBJECTIVE

  Objective of the scheme is that the end product/ outcome/ findings of R&D work should benefit Food Processing Industry in terms of product and process development, improved preservation, packaging, storage and distribution technologies, value addition, standardization of additives, coloring agents, preservatives, pesticide residues, etc. with focus on enhancement of production, quality, consumer safety, public health and trade.

ELIGIBLE ENTITIES

  All Universities, IITs, Central/ State Government Institutions, Government funded Organisations, R&D laboratories and CSIR-recognized R&D units in private sector. For the purpose of sanction of grant and release of instalments, the entities that are Government/ Public Sector Entities or those private universities (which have courses on Food Processing Technology) that have been granted AAAA+ accreditation by UGC shall be called Category-A entities while others shall be called Category-B entities.

ELIGIBLE PURPOSES

1.  Ministry supports research proposals preferably of applied nature with commercial value resulting in development of innovative products, processes and manufacturing practices, which lead to development of food processing industry in the country.

Preference will be given to the following R&D project proposals:

(a) Projects that are beneficial for SMEs and farmers, use outcome/ findings of previous R&D projects and are intended towards its commercialization.

(b) Projects relating to development of innovative food packaging material from waste material of food industry material of food industry.

(c) Projects relating to Millet based innovative products.

(d) Projects wherein Industry Partners have separate/ dedicated research centres, investing financial contributions of at least 10% of cost of equipment in the project

    1.  The R&D projects supported under the Scheme need to be carried out in collaboration with an industrial partner, which can take up/ purchase/ commercialize outcome of the project.

    2.  The patent rights, in all cases supported under the Scheme, shall lie with the organisation to whom grant has been provided by MoFPI and outcome of R&D project will be in public domain. An Agreement in this regard will be signed between concerned organization and the Industry Partner(s) in the format at Annexure-H.

    3.  Condition of having an industry partner in the project, may not be applicable, if the Ministry directs NIFTEMs or any other public body to undertake a specific research in public interest.
