**Operational Guidelines**

**Integrated Nutrient Management Division Department of Agriculture, & Farmers Welfare Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare**  
**Krishi Bhavan, New Delhi – 110 001**

1. ## **About Natural Farming (NF)**

   1. Natural Farming is a chemical free farming, involving livestock (preferably local breed of cow) integrated natural farming methods and diversified crop systems rooted in the Indian traditional knowledge. It is aimed towards improving soil health and restoring ecosystems and reducing input cost to the farmer to achieve greater climate resilience. NF recognises the interdependence of the natural ecosystem amongst soil, water, microbiome, plants, animals, climate and human requirements.

   2. Natural farming is integrated with livestock (preferably local breed of cow), involves use of on-farm inputs like Beejamrut, Jeevamrut, Ghan Jeevamrut, Neemastra, Dashparni, etc., multi-cropping systems, Pre-monsoon dry sowing, biomass based mulching, use of traditional varieties of seeds, integration of trees on buffer zones of farm, etc. NF practices improves soil structure, nutrition & soil organic carbon, enhances moisture retention & water holding capacity, promotes crop diversification and encourages natural habitats that enhance the on-farm biodiversity. NF follows local agro-ecological principles rooted in local knowledge and location specific technologies. On-farm innovations like application of multi-species green manure, farm made manure, compost, etc. are emerging along with the other components.

   3. Knowledge of Natural Farming which is being practiced by farmers across the country, is traditionally built within the farmers and their communities. To leverage this, NMNF will enable a decentralized cross learning ecosystem blending the traditional NF knowledge of practicing farmers and the communities with the scientific approaches evolved in the Agricultural Universities (AUs) / Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) / ICAR Institutions, etc.

2. ## **Need**

   1. The green revolution technologies have revolutionized food production and transformed the Indian agriculture from subsistence to a surplus generating enterprise. Now, there is a need for exploring alternative agricultural systems that are more sustainable and offer better climate resilience.

   2. Natural Farming is a highly location specific farming system. The transition period towards natural farming depends on the organic carbon content of the soil, practice of all NF packages of practices, cropping system adopted, local agro-ecology, among others. For example, in soil with organic carbon content higher than 1%, the

      transition to natural farming is faster in comparison to soils with lower soil organic carbon. Similarly, the transition period is quicker in rainfed agriculture areas than in irrigated regions due to factors such as high chemical input use.

   3. A planned transition towards a mass movement (*Jan Bhagidari*) for natural farming needs to be scientifically backed up and requires dedicated long term investment on the capacities/ knowledge of the scientific research and extension systems. A robust knowledge extension needs to be established to provide necessary support to the farmers, community based organisations (CBO) such as Self Help Groups (SHG), Village organizations (VO), Primary Agricultural Credit Society (PACS), Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), etc. Close collaboration with practicing NF farmers/ communities, Local NF Institutions (LNFI) are essential for such a transition.

   4. In order to institutionally root the transition process, it is essential to have location specific solutions, scientifically backed knowledge based extension, reorientation of research towards local agroecology and on-farm research with both scientists and farmers.

3. ## **Chemical Free Farming Systems**

   1. The Government of India is promoting chemical-free farming systems of agriculture through Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna (PKVY), and NF under a sub-scheme of PKVY \- Bhartiya Prakratik Krishi Paddhati (BPKP).

   2. Now, Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DA\&FW) is upscaling BPKP in a Mission mode through the National Mission on Natural Farming building upon the strength of the NF concept, and the success achieved in spreading NF through efforts of Centre and State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), practicing NF farmers, institutions/ organizations carrying out NF extension and farmer communities.

4. ## **National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF)**

   1. NMNF is a standalone Centrally Sponsored Scheme under Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DA\&FW), Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (MoA\&FW) with an outlay of  
      ₹2481.00 crore, (Government of India share is ₹1584.00 crore and States share is ₹897.00 crore). The Mission is a shift to strengthen agriculture practices with scientifically backed approaches towards sustainability, climate resilience and safe food.

   2. ## **Mission Objectives**

1. To promote nature based sustainable systems of farming, enhancing usage of on-farm made natural farming bio-inputs to reduce dependency on externally purchased inputs and input cost reduction. To also improve soil health and have sustainable agriculture practices.

2. To popularize livestock (preferably local breed of cow) integrated agriculture-animal husbandry models.

3. To strengthen on-farm agroecological research and knowledge based extension capacities of ICAR institutions, KVKs, Agricultural Universities, etc.

4. To build upon the on-field experience of practicing NF farmers and scientific expertise to thereby evolve & improvise location specific NF package of practices for increased spread of NF.

5. To establish scientifically supported common standards and easy farmer friendly certification procedures for naturally grown chemical-free produce.

6. To create and promote a single national brand for naturally grown chemical-free produce.

   3. Till the 15th finance commission, awareness generation, orientation and capacity building of Missions at the State/ District/ Block/ Gram Panchayat (GP)/ Villages, scientists from ICAR / KVK / AUs, NF experts, implementing agencies, farmers, community based organizations and Gram Panchayats shall be taken up. NMNF will be implemented in 15,000 clusters in willing Gram Panchayats to outreach the message of NF to 1 crore farmers and initiate NF in 7.5 Lakh Ha area. These clusters will be the seeding areas where the willing farmers would be trained on NF package of practices and generate on-ground experiences.

This will include decentralized farmer-to-farmer extension system supported by; localized and context specific agri-infrastructure such as Bio-Input Resource Centers (BRCs), community managed traditional varieties seed systems, small scale farm implements, etc; and market systems such as local farmers’ markets; value addition in food processing, etc.

8. **Training Ecosystem \-** Natural Farming is a knowledge and local agro-ecology based farming practice which requires behavioral changes in farmers and community members. The mission will hence adopt an extension strategy that is focused on on-farm

   knowledge that is scientifically derived from NF practice on farmers’ fields, and is supported with continuous hand holding of farmers.

   1. The Scientists, Farmer Master Trainers (FMT), nodal person from Local Natural Farming Institutions (LNFI) and State Government Officials will undergo orientation and training on NF at **Centers’ of Natural Farming (CoNF)**. AUs, national level NF Institutions etc. that are promoting NF, have experience, credibility and expertise in conducting NF training programmes and have ongoing research initiatives will be identified as CoNF by DA\&FW in consultation with States. A CoNF should have NF model demonstration farms at farmers’ fields for training activities and exposure visits. The mission in the State will start with training conducted in the CoNFs. CoNF centers will conduct 2 rounds of training for Scientists from ICAR/ KVK/ AU, Central / State Government officials, and to all FMTs.

4. Districts with Low fertiliser input sale in States

5. Districts with tribal areas \- Blocks from the Tribal Sub plan

6. Districts with strong SRLM / PACS / FPOs and other Community Based Organisations (CBOs)

   Preference will be given to areas having the presence of practicing NF farmers.

   2. **The Mission will work in selected 15,000 Clusters** across the identified districts from the priority areas reaching 7.5 Lakh Ha area. The District will identify Gram Panchayats (GP) in suitable Blocks for taking up NMNF. In each selected GP, cluster(s) of contiguous areas cumulative to 50 Ha and approximately 125 farmers will be developed as NF clusters based on their willingness to implement NF within the identified GP. The cluster size may be reviewed and appropriately set for the Himalayan/ hilly States and areas with difficult terrain by the respective SLEC. Each farmer is encouraged to start in small landholding, and is eligible for support under NMNF to a maximum of one acre to enable learning. In case cumulative contiguous area of 50 Ha. could not be found in 1 GP, the cluster can be formed in adjoining GPs (not more than 2-3 GPs).

   3. To encourage the spirit of competition, the States are encouraged to take up programs to mobilise interest of the Gram Panchayat (GP) to adopt Natural Farming, such GPs which come forward to promote NF may have natural preference in selection. The District Level Monitoring Committee shall identify and onboard Gram Panchayats that are willing to take up NF from within the NMNF priority regions. Such GPs may also be encouraged to converge their own funds or mobilise other resources for the promotion of NF in a landscape approach.

   4. **30,000 Krishi Sakhis (Community Resource Persons \- CRP)** \- For easy scaling up of NF practices and knowledge, the farmer to farmer extension is to be anchored in Community Based Organisations (CBOs) like women SHGs/ FPOs/ PACS etc. Two CRPs per cluster will be deployed to generate community wide awareness and mobilise farmers to practice NF. Krishi Sakhis or practicing NF farmers must be the CRPs, the indicative process guideline for Krishi Sakhi (CRP) is given in Annexure VI.  
1. The Krishi Sakhis (CRP) will undergo on-field hands-on training by FMTs and Scientists/ Experts associated with KVK/ AU/ LNFI.  
2. A team of 2 Krishi Sakhis (CRP) will mobilise approximately 125 willing farmers and form a cluster (cumulative area of 50 Ha).  
3. The Krishi Sakhis (CRP) with support from Block level mission, ATMA and FMT etc will organise meetings with members of SHGs, Anganwadi, Gram Sabha etc orienting them about the benefits of NF, about the Mission and on preparation of bio-inputs like Jeevamrut, Beejamrut, etc.  
4. The Krishi Sakhis (CRPs) will mobilise and enroll the willing farmers to practice NF at the beginning of each crop season.

5. With help of the FMT, the Krishi Sakhi (CRP) will orient the enrolled farmers on the NF practices that are to be followed during the season and ensure their implementation in the field.

   5. **Willing Farmers in a NF clusters** \- The 125 willing farmers get initiated into NF and progressively expand the number of NF practices and the area allocated for NF within their land holding. Farmers may start practicing NF in a smaller area and gradually expand to their entire land holding as they gain experience and confidence on NF. The 125 willing farmers will then each create awareness and train 6 more farmers to initiate NF practices, expanding the outreach of NF to additional \~750 farmers per cluster.

   6. The 18.75 Lakh trained farmers will create awareness and train 6 more farmers each in the NF model demonstration farms of trained farmers and farms attached to KVK/ AU/ LNFI etc thereby encouraging 1 crore farmers to initiate NF. The trained farmers will be provided with output based incentive to practice NF package of practices & NF good practices like PMDS, application of Beejamrut, Jeevamrut, etc., diversified cropping system, etc.; train 6 more farmers, upkeep of their livestock, prepare NF inputs or purchase NF inputs from BRC, and purchase drums, mixing & storage containers, etc. The detailed indicative guidelines for the trained willing farmers are given in Annexure VII.

   7. State Mission Unit, District and Block Level Monitoring Committees will conduct regular monitoring of farm level indicators, farmer progressions and extension of NF across the clusters. States may also carry out social audits to ensure communities involvement/ ownership and accountability.

13. A simple participatory certification system shall be initiated for the farmers transitioning to NF as part of the Mission, similar to the Participatory Guarantee System. NCONF shall develop the certification procedures.

14. **Common Branding \-** Common National Brand shall be developed for naturally grown chemical-free produce. The detailed Operational Guidelines will be developed and shared.

Convergence will also be explored with the various programmes/ projects/ schemes of Central & State Governments viz. schemes of DA\&FW, APEDA, Rural Development, Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Ministry of Ayush, Cooperation, Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DAH\&D), Ministry of Tribal Affairs, etc.; Non-Government Organizations, Philanthropy, CSR, International Institutions, etc. associated with NF on thematics ranging from value addition in food processing, safe & nutritious food, water quality, etc. For example, linkages with *Goshalas* will be explored for ensuring the availability of inputs, enhancing local livestock (preferably local breed of cow) population through breed improvement, development of NF model demonstration farms at Central Cattle Breeding Farms/ Regional Fodder Stations, etc. through convergence with DAH\&D, provide market linkages at district/ block/ GP levels through convergence for local farmers’ markets, APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) Mandis, Haats, Depots, etc.

19. ## **Bhartiya Prakritik Kheti Bio-input Resource Centres (BRCs)**

    1. For the successful adoption of NF, access to livestock and plants for preparing animal and plant based NF inputs are key. Therefore, it is proposed to establish 10,000 need-based BRCs for production and supply of NF inputs at local levels in an enterprise model and support farmers willing to adopt NF and those who are not in a position to prepare these by themselves.

    2. These BRCs can be operated by practicing NF farmers, FPOs, SHG, PACS/ Cooperatives, local rural entrepreneurs, KVKs, etc. with *Goshalas* at Gram Panchayat or any other agency identified by the State.

    3. Detailed Operational Guidelines for establishment, operational modalities and protocols will be developed and shared.

2. The tentative allocation for the States for the next financial year will be intimated by NF Cell, INM Division, DA\&FW by February every year.

1. The State Government will prepare a prospective implementation

   plan for the duration of the Mission with details of potential regions for the clusters, and timelines for implementation. Encouraging the spirit of competition, willingness from Gram Panchayats will be done to identify Gram Panchayats for the mission. Subsequently a consolidated action plan on a project basis with details such as area to be taken up in each cluster; NF cropping systems to be adopted, number of beneficiaries to be on-boarded, implementation schedule with a time bound road map along with annual targets and funds requirements shall be prepared.

2. The Annual Action Plan (AAP) duly approved by SLEC along with the minutes of SLEC, shall reach DA\&FW for examination, deliberation and final approval by first week of April every year. Post facto approvals from SLEC can also be considered.

3. NF Cell at DA\&FW will examine, sanction AAP, release funds and accordingly intimated to States.

4. For receiving funds under NMNF, it is mandatory for States to open SNA and Child Agencies Account and map the same in PFMS

5. States/ Implementing agencies will furnish utilization certificate (UC) in the prescribed format (Form GFR 12-C) and physical & financial progress report containing physical and financial targets of the previous grants-in-aid, along with State share, before requesting for release of subsequent installments.

6. All Implementing Agencies (IAs) are required to maintain subsidiary accounts of the grants-in-aid and get the same audited from a Chartered Accountant.

7. Output based incentives to farmers will be released as per provisions for release of funds contained in GFR 2017 and instructions issued in this regard by Government of India from time to time.

21. ## **Online Digital Monitoring Mechanism**

    1. The Mission will have a strong online based monitoring and evaluation mechanism. NMNF will have a robust online digital portal with a geospatial data system for tracking the progress of the Mission’s activities \- onboarding, maintaining baseline and periodic data. The portal will capture and track the field data in the clusters \- of farmers, farms, soil health, etc. and NF practices, providing an

       assessment of the progressive spread of NF. Baseline data will be captured and the progress tracked on a Web-GIS-Mobile integrated system. Dashboards and reports will be generated for conducting impact assessment across all levels.

    2. The digital Portal will provide a dynamic updated repository of institutions, resource farmers, trainers, organizations involved in NF across the country including their geotagged information. In addition to the program database, the Portal will also compile NF related databases of various institutions/organizations/groups working on NF independent of the Mission; thus, providing an integrated database of NF for the country.

    3. The digital Portal will also be the knowledge repository serving various stakeholders, sharing local innovations in NF practices, providing curated knowledge products such as packages of practices, training modules, communication materials and such others useful for the practitioners.

    4. **Submission of Reports and uploading of information on NF Portal \-** The dedicated portal of NMNF will function as a central knowledge management-cum-reporting and progress review platform. All Central and State level implementing agencies will be required to upload quarterly progress in the respective module. Acceptance of the Utilization Certificates and subsequent release of installments will be linked with the progress uploaded on this portal.
