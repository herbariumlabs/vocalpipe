**_Operational Guidelines for Coconut Development Board Schemes_**

**Component-III: Coconut Palm Insurance Scheme (CPIS**)

# Introduction

Coconut cultivation subjected to risks from climatic changes, natural disasters, pests, diseases etc. and, at times, entire coconut cultivation of a region, gets wiped out due to natural calamity or onset of pest attack. Coconut is a perennial crop and losses suffered by farmers due to damage of this crop, are material and needs to be addressed.

Coconut palms are perennial crops, but palm trees are characterized by periodic system of crop setting and outcomes and hence resemble seasonal annual crops and should, accordingly, eligible for insurance cover. Since coconut is cultivated under rain-fed management and is susceptible to biotic and a-biotic stresses, it is necessary to minimize risk faced by coconut farmers, predominantly small and marginal, by covering coconut palms with an insurance scheme.

# Objectives

1.  Assist coconut growers in insuring coconut palms, against natural and other perils.
2.  Provide timely relief to farmers, who suffer income loss due to sudden death of palms.
3.  Minimize risk and encourage replanting and rejuvenation to make coconut farming remunerative.

# Applicability:

The CPIS will be applicable to all healthy nut bearing coconut palms; grown as mono or intercropped; on bunds farms or homestead and to all varieties of coconut, including Tall, Dwarf and Hybrids. Since Dwarf and Hybrids begin to yield fruit from 4th year of planting, this variety of coconut palms in age range of 4-60 year will be covered under the scheme, but Tall variety coconut palms will be eligible for coverage for age range of 7-60 year. Unhealthy and senile palms will be excluded from coverage.

# Eligibility criteria:
