2. ## Introduction {#introduction}

1) To facilitate the achievement of India’s enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets, the Government has initiated development of framework for **‘Indian Carbon Market’ (ICM)** which will mobilise new mitigation opportunities by creating demand for emission reduction credits through private and public entities.

2) The Central Government has notified the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) 2023 on 28 June 2023 under the powers conferred by clause (w) of section 14 of the Energy Conservation Act 2001 (52 of 2001). This legislation delineates the Indian carbon market, establishing a national framework with the aim of reducing, removing, or avoiding the greenhouse gases emissions (GHG) from Indian economy. It achieves this by pricing the greenhouse gases emission reduction through trading of the carbon credit certificates.

3) The Energy Conservation Act 2001 authorises the Government of India to specify the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme and to issue the ‘Carbon Credit Certificates (CCC)’ to the registered entities under different mechanisms. Whereas the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 empowers the Government of India to specify standards for emission or discharge of pollutant for the obligated entities.

4) Under the CCTS, the Government has introduced a ‘Compliance Mechanism’, where the obligated entities shall comply to the greenhouse gas emission intensity targets as may be notified by the central government. Under the CCTS, the compliance mechanism is detailed as below:

   1. The sectors and the obligated entities to be covered under the compliance mechanism shall be decided by the Ministry of Power (MoP) based on the recommendations of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency and The National Steering Committee for Indian Carbon Market.

   2. The National Steering Committee for Indian Carbon Market (NSC-ICM) is responsible for the governance, oversight, and functioning of the ICM. The committee is chaired by the Secretary, Ministry of Power and co-chaired by the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. NSC-ICM also comprises of representatives from relevant government ministries and agencies, representative of state government and industry experts.

   3. The Bureau would develop the targets in terms of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per unit of equivalent product or output after taking into account relevant aspects including available technologies and likely cost of their implementation.

4. The Ministry of Power, after considering the recommendations of Bureau and National Steering Committee for Indian carbon market (NSC-ICM), shall recommend the greenhouse gases emission intensity targets against each obligated entity to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) for notification under the Environment Protection Act 1986\.

   5. The obligated entities shall be required to achieve greenhouse gases emission intensity in accordance with the targets notified by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

   6. The obligated entities shall also be required to meet any other targets such as use of non-fossil energy consumption as may be notified by the Ministry of Power under the Energy Conservation Act.

5) Further the clause (12) of CCTS, specifies the provisions to develop and publish the detailed procedure for operationalisation of Indian Carbon Market which shall contain the following:

1) Criteria for issuance of carbon credit certificates

2) Validity of carbon credit certificates

3) Floor and forbearance price of carbon credit certificates

4) Requirement, format, and timeline for submissions

5) Monitoring, reporting, and verification and

6) Any other related and incidental matters.

3. ## Compliance Mechanism {#compliance-mechanism}

1) The Carbon Credit Trading Scheme specifies the compliance mechanism, whereby the registered entities which are notified under the compliance mechanism are called as ‘obligated entity’.

2) The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) shall notify the GHG emission intensity targets in terms of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) per unit of equivalent product or output for each year of the defined trajectory period for the obligated entities, based on the recommendations of the Ministry of Power.

3) The obligated entities will be notified of an annual target for a trajectory period before its commencement. Upon completion of trajectory period, the targets shall be revised for the subsequent trajectory period.

4) An obligated entity, once notified in any trajectory period, must comply with the assigned GHG emission intensity targets for each annual year, known as the compliance year.

   An obligated entity who reduces their GHG emission intensity beyond the target GHG emission intensity in a compliance year is entitled to the issuance of Carbon Credit Certificates (CCC). These are based on the difference between the achieved GHG emission intensity and target GHG emission intensities, multiplied by the production units in the relevant compliance year.

5) An obligated entity failing to meet the target GHG emission intensity in a compliance year must surrender Carbon Credit Certificates (CCC). The required number of CCCs is calculated by the difference between the actual and the target GHG emission intensities, multiplied by the production for that year. Should the entity lack the necessary certificates for surrender, it must purchase additional CCCs.

6) In case of the CCC to be surrendered, the obligated entities may surrender the banked CCCs or purchase the Carbon Credit Certificates (CCC) to comply with the GHG emission intensity targets in each compliance year.

7) The illustration below shows that obligated entity ‘A’ receives CCC for achieving a GHG emission intensity below the target. In contrast, obligated entity ‘B’ must purchase the CCCs from the trading platform to comply with the GHG emission intensity targets.

   *Figure 1: Working of Compliance Mechanism*

8) The obligated entity 'A' may sell their Certified Carbon Credits (CCC), while obligated entity 'B' must surrender the CCC through the trading exchange to comply with the notified annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity targets.

   2) For the purpose of point (i) (b) The activity data shall be calculated as consumption of fuel or material calculated based on the quantity of fuel or material received during the compliance year minus the quantity of fuel or material moved out of the entity plus the quantity of fuel or material in stock at the beginning of the compliance year minus the quantity of fuel or material in stock at the end of the compliance year.

   3) The quantity of fuel or material shall be represented in mass as tonne (t) or volume as kilolitre (kL) or cubic metre (m3).

   4) Where it is not feasible to determine quantities in stock by direct measurement due to technical or unreasonable cost associated challenges, the obligated entity may estimate those quantities based on one of the following:

      1) Data from previous years correlated with output for the compliance year.
