Introduction

  India’s food processing industry has undergone rapid transformation, driven by its vast agricultural base, rising domestic demand, and supportive government policies. India is poised to emerge as a global leader in the food processing sector, with an impressive growth trajectory. Agriculture sector forms the backbone of the India’s food processing industry, India being the largest producer of fruits, vegetables, millets, tea, and food grains as well as milk and livestock globally.

  The food processing sector is a priority under the Make in India initiative, with the Ministry of Food Processing Industries implementing schemes to attract investment and develop infrastructure. Mega Food Parks with essential utilities and common processing facilities are being established in agriculturally rich areas, offering a plug-and-play model for entrepreneurs. Investment in these parks is recognized under the Harmonized List of Infrastructure Sub-sectors (HLIS), enabling easier access to infrastructure lending. To further boost investment, the Ministry has launched an Investors Portal (https://www.foodprocessingindia.gov.in/), providing key information on resources, policies, and incentives, while also collaborating with Invest India to facilitate partnerships, regulatory approvals, and investor support.

  The Ministry's budget for 2024-25 increased by approximately 30.19% compared to the previous year

PLISFPI- Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing Industry

  [] The Central Sector Scheme, Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing Industry (PLISFPI) was approved by Union Cabinet in March 2021, with an outlay of ₹10,900 Crore. The Scheme is being implemented over a six-year period from 2021-22 to 2026-27.

  The components of the Scheme are –

1.  Incentivising manufacturing of four major food product segments viz. Ready to Cook/ Ready to Eat (RTC/RTE) foods including Millet based products, Processed Fruits & Vegetables, Marine Products and Mozzarella Cheese (Category I)

2.  Production of Innovative / Organic products of SMEs (Category II)

3.  The third component related to support for branding and marketing abroad (Category III) to incentivize emergence of strong Indian brands for in-store Branding, shelf space renting and marketing.

4.  From the savings under PLISFPI, a component for Production Linked Incentives Scheme for Millet Based Products (PLISMBP) was also carved out from the scheme to encourage the use of Millets in RTC/RTE products and incentivizing them under the PLI Scheme to promote its production, value addition and sale.

  [] As of February 28, 2025, a total of 171 food processing companies have been approved for assistance under various categories of the PLISFPI scheme in the country and incentives to the tune of ₹1155.296 crore has been disbursed, out of which ₹13.266 crore has been disbursed to MSMEs in 20 eligible cases.

Fostering Innovation and Entrepreneurship

  Through these schemes, the Government actively supports Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the food processing sector. These schemes provide financial, technical, and marketing support to SMEs, facilitating capacity expansion, innovation, and formalization. SMEs are also eligible to avail the benefits under various components of the PMKSY Scheme. PMFME scheme specifically targets formalization of unorganized units, improving their access to institutional credit, modern infrastructure, and enhanced food processing capacity. Under the PLI scheme, a significant proportion of beneficiaries are MSMEs, with 70 MSMEs directly enrolled and 40 others contributing as contract manufacturers for larger companies. Collectively, these initiatives have strengthened SMEs by fostering innovation, improving competitiveness, expanding market access, generating employment opportunities, and supporting the broader value chain in the food processing industry.

  Under the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing Industries (PLISFPI), the Government provides financial incentives to promote Indian food brands abroad, supporting branding and marketing activities for Indian-branded consumer food products in global markets. Beneficiaries are reimbursed 50% of their expenditure on branding and marketing abroad, capped at 3% of their annual food product sales or ₹50 crore per year, whichever is lower. Applicants are required to spend a minimum of ₹5 crore over five years to qualify. Currently, there are currently 73 beneficiaries under this component of the PLI scheme.
