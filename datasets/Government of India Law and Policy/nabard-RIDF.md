FOREWORD

Shri Shaji K V

Chairman, NABARD

  Infrastructure development is a key driver of economic growth, productive investment, job creation and poverty reduction. As India embarks upon its journey to become a $5 trillion economy, investment in rural infrastructure including irrigation, rural roads, rural education & health institutions, etc., assume critical importance to ensure that growth is inclusive and sustainable.

  In its endeavour to further rural prosperity, NABARD has been providing financial assistance at concessional rates to State Governments for creating/strengthening rural infrastructure. The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF), which is now in its 28th year, has played a significant role in successful grounding of projects across the country under three broad sectors viz. (i) Agriculture and Related areas, (ii) Rural connectivity and (iii) Social Sector. RIDF has been instrumental in furthering the UN mandated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including No Poverty, Zero Hunger, Good Health & Well Being, Quality Education, Clean Water & Sanitation, Affordable & Clean Energy, Decent Work & Economic Growth to name a few. By bridging the crucial funding gap in the realm of rural infrastructure, NABARD has positively impacted the socio-economic landscape of rural India.

  Currently there are 39 activities, which are eligible for support under RIDF. The projects supported under RIDF are expected to create/restore irrigation potential of 374.54 lakh ha, construction/upgradation of 5.26 lakh km of rural roads and

  13.06 lakh meters of bridges, creating non-recurring employment of 3001.47 crore mandays.

  Through this booklet, an attempt has been made to provide information and highlight some of the major projects sanctioned under RIDF and their socio economic impact at the ground level. I would like to place on record my sincere thanks and appreciation to the State Governments for their unstinted efforts in prioritizing the projects and executing and implementing them in a time bound manner. I am sure the booklet will give an insight to the joint endeavours of NABARD, RBI, Govt. of India and the State Governments in strengthening the rural infrastructure and bringing about change in living standards of the rural populace.

FOREWORD

  Shri PVS Suryakumar Deputy Managing Director NABARD

  A robust & resilient infrastructure is one of the defining features of a developed country. India is aspiring to be a developed economy and is steadfastly pursuing that path. The aspiration to reach a 5 trillion $ economy by 2025 is also a right step in that direction. Rural infrastructure is mostly in the nature of public good and powers the local economies and is the focus of this publication.

  NABARD since its establishment in 1982 is committed to usher in rural prosperity through a bouquet of interventions. Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) has been supporting creation of rural infrastructure since 1995-96. A very small portion of the priority sector shortfall of banks is channelized for creation of rural infrastructure for 39 eligible activities, which in fact creates more business opportunities for the banks as the local economies get a fillip by the rural infrastructure created. This fact is both supported by anecdotal evidence and the research conducted by reputed institutions from India. NABARD has so far sanctioned 7.63 lakh projects with a cumulative loan amount of

  `4,85,588.28 crore.

  This booklet provides a glimpse of RIDF guidelines and captures a few best practices in rural areas; roads, bridges, irrigation projects, drinking water projects, health centers and educational institutions from across the country. I am sure the readers will find the booklet useful.

  I also would take this opportunity to thank the Government of India, Reserve Bank of India and the State Governments for their commitment to ensure that rural infrastructure flourishes in the country.

[]PROMISE OF BETTER LIFE IN EVERY DROP

Augmentation of Drinking Water Supply Scheme, Haryana

  The project involves supply of drinking water in 14 villages located in the south west directions of Rewari district which was under extreme stress. The main source of drinking water in Khaleta and surrounding villages in Rewari district of Haryana was tube wells, the quality of which was deteriorating. Thus, there was a need to augment the drinking water availability in these villages by drawing water from alternate sources.

  Govt. of Haryana proposed the project under RIDF for providing canal-based water works at village Khaleta, district Rewari. The canal water from Deewana distributory near Budoli water works is being pumped to the water treatment plant at village Khaleta and the clean water is supplied to villagers. The commissioning of the project has led to a significant improvement in health and sanitation in the villages covered. The project has also led to time savings in sourcing water, improved health of the population covered, increase in daily income, etc.

Mission Bhagiratha, Telangana

  The drinking water supply to households in Telangana State was primarily tapping the groundwater source. Continuous drafting over the years has led to a faster depletion of groundwater as well as deterioration in its quality. Hence, the Govt. of Telangana launched a flagship programme called “Mission Bhagiratha” to provide potable drinking water supply of 100 lpcd to rural households.

  As per the programme, Krishna and Godavari rivers and existing reservoirs will be interlinked to channelize, treat, store and supply treated drinking water throughout the State. It involves laying of over 1.50 lakh km length of pipelines including both transmission lines and intra-village distribution pipelines.

  The project will benefit about 2.72 crore population in the State. Besides supplying water to households, it will also cater to the water supply needs of schools, anganwadis and other institutions and thereby improve overall health and hygiene standards essential for socio-economic upliftment of the region.
