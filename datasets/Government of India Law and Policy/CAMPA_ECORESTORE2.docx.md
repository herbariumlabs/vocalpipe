Sir/ Madam,

Please refer the minutes of the 4th meeting of Governing Body of theNational Authority held on 29.12.2023, which accorded the ecological restoration of the degraded forest or non\-forest areas on the highest priority. The Governing Body emphasised that the States should focus on the following priorities set by the Governing Body:

1. Therejuvenation of lakes and water bodiesand heritageconservation of natural assets focusing on greening coastal areas for peaceful co\-existence with nature. The Forest Departments of all Coastal States should make their besteffo1ts to implement MISHTI Programme in their State. National CAMPA is also providing financial support to States for implementation of various activities under MISHTI Programme.

2. Innovation in management of forest and other natural ecosystem for restoration of grassland, Aravalli restoration, restoration of Mangroves and Creeks in the coastal areas. Suitable proposals may be sent to National CAMPA in this regard.

3. Preservation and restoration of natural ecosystems should be given highest priority under CAMPA which should not only include only afforestation/ tree planting activity but restoring of the landscape by working with nature to help the nature to regenerate in its own ways on pilot basis for 5,000\- I 0,000 acres of degraded forests. Such efforts will help in rejuvenation of the rivers originating or flowing through the forests and Protected Areas. The NPY funds with the State CAMPA should be utilised primarily for eco-restoration of these areas.

2. As a follow up, the Guiding Principles for Ecological Restoration have been circulated to PCCF & HoFFs & Heads of Forest Departments of all States and Union Territories for comments and suggestions. The matter was also discussed in the 28111,29th & 30th Executive Committee meeting that the States/UTs send their proposals for the same either as part of the State APO or as National CAMPA funded Schemehowever, theproposals are yet to be received by National Authority.

3. # It is requested to send the project proposals for Eco-restoration of degraded and non-forest lands either within State/UT APO or send a separate proposal as National CAMPA funded Scheme.

**Your faithfully,**
