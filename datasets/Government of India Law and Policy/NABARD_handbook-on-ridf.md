  []FOREWORD

  NABARD has been providing financial support to State Governments for strengthening rural infrastructure, under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF). The Fund has played a significant role in completion of 1arge number of successful projects across the country under three broad sectors i.e., (i) Agriculture and related areas (ii) Rural Connectivity and (iii) Social Sector. Currently, 37 activities are eligible under RIDF for support. RIDF investments have benefited the rural population by way of increase in income levels, diversification of rural livelihood activities, improvement in quality of life, greater financial inclusion, etc.

  In order to facilitate State Government officials at implementationlevel, a compilation in the form of Hand Book, containing various policy and operational instruction communicated by NABARD from time to time was provided. There has been a felt need for updation of the Hand Book based on the existing policy and procedural instructions as various changes/amendments have taken place subsequently. The same will be fulfilled with this publication.

  This Hand Book is aimed to be a source of knowledge for those dealing with RIDF projects at implementation level as well as those at the higher level. The detailed procedures enunciated will enrich the understanding of RIDF. It is expected that this Hand Book will prove to be a vital resource in serving the objective of NABARD in development of rural infrastructure.

  Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF)

Genesis

1.  Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) was instituted in the year 1995-96 in NABARD. In the 1995–96 budget speech, the then Hon’ble Union Finance Minister made a statement that “Inadequacy of public investment in agriculture is today a matter of general concern. This is an area which is the responsibility of States. But many states have neglected investment in infrastructure for agriculture. There are many rural infrastructure projects which have been started but are lying incomplete for want of resources. They represent a major loss of potential income and employment to rural population”. On the other hand, there was the problem of continuous shortfall in agricultural lending mainly due to bottlenecks in infrastructure or due to the conservative lending policy and practices of commercial banks. So, the Government announced in the 1995–96 Union budget that a Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) would be created with funding from the Scheduled Commercial Banks which would contribute to the extent of shortfall in their agricultural lending subject to a maximum of 1.5% of the Net Bank Credit. It was thus strategic meshing of objectives of funding the rural infrastructural gap and the lending gap of the Commercial Banks.

2.  The fund was initially created with a corpus of ₹2000 crore for giving support to State Governments for quick completion of ongoing projects relating to medium and minor irrigation, soil conservation, watershed management and other forms of rural infrastructure. Even though RIDF was set up with the immediate objective of leading the existing incomplete projects to completion, in subsequent years it was appreciated that there is a large void to be filled in terms of unmet demand for rural infrastructure. Hence, subsequently, coverage of RIDF was broad-based in various tranches and at present 37 activities under three broad sectors viz.: Agriculture & Related Sector, Connectivity Sector and Social Sector are being funded under RIDF.

3.  RBI makes bank-wise allocations to the annual corpus based on the priority sector shortfall by each bank. Under RIDF I, the fund was allocated from the shortfall in sub-target (18%) for agriculture under priority sector lending. From RIDF II to XIV, the funds were allocated from shortfall in priority sector lending (40%) and / or agriculture (18%). From RIDF XV onwards, the allocation to RIDF is being met out of shortfall from priority sector and/or agriculture and/or weaker section (10%). From an initial allocation of ₹2,000 crore under RIDF Tranche I for the year 1995-96, the allocation has reached the level of ₹40,491 crore under RIDF XXVII (2021-22). As on 31 March 2021, 26 tranches of RIDF with total allocation of ₹3,78,022 crore have funded 7.09 lakh projects with cumulative sanctions of ₹4,09,063 crore (including ₹18,500 crore under Bharat Nirman).

Normative Allocation

  The corpus announced for each Tranche is allocated among different States/UTs based on a set of parameters which include geographical area of State/UT, rural population including rural poverty, composite infrastructure development index, inverse of Rural CD ratio, per capita PS Credit, performance of State/UT in utilisation under RIDF and share of past sanctions for Agriculture and Rural Drinking Water Projects.

Phasing

1.  The implementation phase for projects sanctioned is spread over 2-5 years, varying with type of the project and also location of the State/UT. As against maximum phasing period of 2 - 3 years for normal projects, a phasing period of 4 years is permitted for projects from North East (including Sikkim) & Hilly States / UTs (Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakah, Uttarakhand &

  Himachal Pradesh). The phasing of 5 years is permitted for major & medium irrigation projects and other stand-alone projects involving RIDF loan of ₹50 crore and above.

2.  The phasing of projects, sanctioned in second half of the financial year i.e., between 01st October and 31st March, is reckoned from 01st April of the subsequent financial year. The works can however be executed ahead of the schedule and reimbursements claimed therefor accordingly.

3.  While Tranche I to XIX have been closed, Tranches XX to XXVII are on-going. The phasing of any specific tranche is extended based on requests from States/UTs and/or any other genuine reason.

Eligible Activities

1.  Under RIDF I, incomplete Irrigation, Soil conservation, Watershed Management projects etc. were financed as a 'last mile approach' to facilitate completion of the projects delayed on account of budgetary constraints. Coverage of RIDF has been broad-based in subsequent tranches and at present a wide range of 37 activities, (Annexure I) as approved by Government of India, covering almost all aspects of rural infrastructure are being funded under RIDF.

2.  The activities are classified under three broad categories i.e., (i) Agriculture and Related Sectors which are eligible for loans upto 95 per cent of eligible project cost, (ii) Social Sector, where loans can be upto 90 per cent of eligible project cost in North eastern and Hilly States and 85 per cent of project cost in all other States and (iii) Rural Connectivity Sector where loans are extended upto 90 per cent of eligible project cost in North-eastern and Hilly States and 80 per cent in all other States.

Rate of Interest

  With effect from 01 April 2012, interest rates on RIDF loans had been linked to the Bank Rate prevailing at the time of disbursement. As of now, lending rate (irrespective of Tranche) is Bank Rate minus 1.5 percentage points (as on the date of disbursement).

Documentation /Security

i.  All loans sanctioned by NABARD under RIDF are secured by the irrevocable letter of authority/ mandate executed by State/UT Govt and registered with Reserve Bank of India / Principal Banker to the State Government/UT, for repayment of the principal and/or payment of interest to NABARD. Mandate Format is given as Annexure IX.

ii. Submission of Time promissory Note (TPN) in the prescribed format for each release of loan (TPN format is given as Annexure II)

iii. Acceptance of terms and conditions (General and Special) of sanction in the duplicate copy of the sanction letter.

iv. General Terms and Conditions of sanction & other conditions under RIDF is given as

  Annexure III A & B.

Appraisal & Sanction of Proposals

1.  RIDF funding is based on project-based lending which entails submission of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) containing technical and financial parameters, drawings, maps etc. submitted by the Implementing Departments of State Government (through Nodal Dept.). The checklists for use by the concerned State Government Departments in preparation/formulation of projects in respect of irrigation, roads & bridges, social sector and agriculture & allied activities have been forwarded to State Governments vide letter NB.SPD/1089/B.123/2005-06 dated 30 Sep. 2005. (Annexure IV)

    1.  The cost estimates of projects are to be as per the latest Schedule of rates (SoR)/Market rates and should be prepared after detailed field survey. Identifiable items of capital nature are only eligible for consideration under RIDF. Pre-appraisal expenses such as expenses incurred on project preparation, cost of technical surveys are allowed upto 0.5 % of the RIDF loan eventually sanctioned, provided the same is outsourced.

    2.  Contingency is permitted up to a maximum limit of 3 % of civil works under the project.

    3.  An inbuilt provision for cost escalation over the updated cost as mentioned in DPR/Project report is also permitted. For projects having phasing upto 2 years -"upto 5% over the updated cost." and for project having phasing of more than 2 years “upto 10 % over the updated cost" is allowed.

  7.3 DPRs for the project Proposals prioritised by State Government will have to be submitted to NABARD Regional Offices through the Nodal (Finance) Department of State Government. The projects prioritised by the State Governments should be completed in 2-5 years. The projects should be technically feasible and financially viable. Economic Rate of Return should be greater than 10% and the Benefit-Cost-Ratio should be more than 1 at a discounting factor of 10%.

1.  Road Projects on Major District Roads (MDRs), Other District Roads (ODRs) & Village Roads (VRs) are eligible for loan under RIDF. Road projects on State Highways, National Highways are not eligible. Norms as per Indian Road Congress (IRC) specifications have to be followed for appraisal of Road projects. Widening of MDRs by increasing the carriage way width to meet the increased traffic intensity is also eligible for RIDF loan. Construction of new bridges as per I.R.C/MORTH specifications to replace the existing old, damaged and narrow bridges is eligible. Bridge projects on State Highways in rural areas are also eligible for RIDF loan.

2.  In case of road projects, provision of maintenance cost upto a maximum of 10% of the project cost can be capitalised in the project cost. A Defect Liability Period of 5 years has also been made mandatory for projects to be considered after 01 April 2020.

3.  As per Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) guidelines, in case of bridge projects, pro rata cost beyond a specified length is required to be borne by the State Governments. In respect of such projects, the share of State Government could be considered for assistance under RIDF. Similarly, for Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) assisted Major, Medium irrigation projects (and Minor irrigation where applicable), where the loan component is to be raised by State Governments through borrowing, the States can seek support from NABARD under RIDF to meet their own share of AIBP project cost.

4.  Road Projects of less than one km may not be considered under RIDF. State/UT Governments may use other sources of funds for such projects.

5.  In respect of irrigation projects, water courses/distribution system should normally be integral part of the project. Alternatively, the State Government should indicate arrangements for On Farm Development (OFD) works so that water reaches the farmers’ fields. In respect of all ongoing Major Irrigation projects (MJP) and Medium Irrigation projects on Inter-State Rivers, clearance from Central Water Commission (CWC) /Planning Commission is required. Clearances from Ministry of Rural Development (if Rehabilitation & Resettlement is involved) and Ministry of Environment & Forests are required, wherever applicable.

6.  Eligible project proposals received from State Governments are considered for sanction by the Sanctioning Committee.

Time Frame for Grounding of projects

i.  Administrative Approval (AA) - Prior AA or AA within 1 month from the date of in-principle sanction.

ii. Technical Sanction (TS) - within 3 months from the date of sanction.

iii. Tendering - within 6 months from the date of sanction.

iv. Issuance of work order - within 9 months from date of sanction.

v.  Grounding of project - within 12 months from the date of sanction.

Disbursements /Drawals

1.  A request for drawal of funds is to be made in prescribed format by the Finance Department (Nodal Department) of the State Government/authorised person of the Finance Department (if project implementing department is authorised by Finance Department) after satisfactory completion of all the prescribed formalities. (Drawal Application Sample Format is given in Annexure V).

2.  NABARD provides funds on ‘reimbursement basis’, except for the initial 20 per cent of the project loan given as ‘mobilisation advance’. North-Eastern and Hilly States are eligible for 30 % of loan as mobilisation advance. Mobilisation advance is disbursed within 1 year from the date of sanction, on acceptance of the terms & conditions of sanction letter.

3.  Borrowings of State Government under RIDF are governed by Article 293(3) of the Constitution of India under which Government of India grants consent of borrowing by a State Government during a year and Article 293(1) under which limits are fixed by the State legislature for borrowing. Disbursements are made under RIDF projects after receipt of approval of Borrowing Power under Article 293 (3) of Constitution of India by the State Government concerned as also a certificate that no limits have been fixed/ the borrowings are within the limits fixed by the State legislature under Article 293(1).

4.  After scrutiny of drawals, NABARD will call for Time Promissory Note (TPN) from Finance Department (Nodal Department) of the State Government. State Government shall submit TPN and NABARD will release loan/mobilisation advance to the Finance Department.

Repayment Period & Pattern

  RIDF loans shall be repaid by the State Government in accordance with the repayment schedule prescribed by NABARD. At present, loan is to be repaid in equal annual instalments within seven years from the date of drawal, including a grace period of two years.

  The instalments falling due on any date during a month will be payable on the first day of the next month. Interest is payable during the grace period also. The interest shall be paid at the end of each quarter i.e. 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December every year.

Cost Escalation

  State Governments are required to meet cost escalation, if any (apart from inbuilt), out of their own resources. However, for certain genuine reasons, beyond the control of State Governments like i. Change in Schedule of Rates (SoR) ii. Need based unforeseen changes in design and iii. Land acquisition cost due to judicial intervention (restricted to 60 % of the cost of land acquisition) if cost escalation arises, the same may be considered. The proposal for cost escalation need to be forwarded within 2 years from the date of sanction to be eligible for consideration of additional loan.

Non-Starter Projects (NSPs)

  A project will be considered as non-starter if it is not grounded within 12 months from the date of issue of sanction letter, irrespective of whether the mobilisation advance has been availed or not by the State Government. A project will be treated as grounded only where the work order has been issued and the physical work has commenced. The entire mobilisation advance released in respect of the project will be adjusted / recalled as soon as the project becomes a NSP. The sanction will lapse, if the project is not grounded within 18 months from the date of sanction letter.

Project Monitoring Committee

  A High Power Committee (HPC) constituted by the respective State Governments monitors the progress in implementation of the various projects sanctioned to the State from out of the RIDF. HPC meetings are an important institutional mechanism to review RIDF Projects and monitor the progress at highest level. HPC needs to meet once in a quarter and comprise representatives from the Finance/Nodal and other concerned departments. NABARD officials will also participate in the meeting. The Chief Secretary of the State may chair the HPC meetings. However, in the absence of Chief Secretary, Additional Chief Secretary may chair the meetings. All important aspects viz. prioritisation of projects, bottlenecks in implementation, adequacy in borrowing limit, utilisation of allocation etc. shall be discussed in the meeting.

Project Completion Certificate (PCC) / Project Completion Report (PCR)

1.  Implementing Departments may submit a Project Completion Certificate (PCC) to NABARD, immediately on completion of the physical works in respect of the project executed with financial assistance under RIDF. The specimen format in this regard is attached as Annexure VI.

2.  Project Completion Report is a document of information to be furnished by the implementing department after completion of sanctioned projects. The objective in obtaining PCRs is to make

  overall assessment of the project and chalk out strategy for funding identical projects in future/ policy interventions to be introduced, etc.

3.  PCR as per the prescribed formats is to be submitted by the Implementing Department to the Regional Office of NABARD within six months from the date of completion of the projects, in the prescribed format.

  Sample PCR formats are given in Annexure VII.

Social Monitoring

1.  In order to bring the basic details of projects in public domain and generate awareness among the ultimate beneficiaries, media, banks, etc., suitable project boards may be displayed at prominent places by providing physical and financial details in local language and Hindi / English with NABARD’s name.

2.  The boards may be affixed at project site within 15 days of commencement / completion of tendering process / formalities for the project. A specimen format of Project Display Board is given as Annexure VIII.

3.  For civil structures like Hospitals, School Buildings etc., NABARD logo and basic details should be permanently engraved in the structure in addition to display boards. A certificate stating adherence to the above requirement may be furnished in para 4 (x) of drawal application.
