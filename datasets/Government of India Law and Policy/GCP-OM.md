iii. Preference shall be given to indigenous species. Also, high-quality seedlings

•J need to be planted for ensuring healthy growth of the planted species.

  []- • • . -- ......- -' -

l iv. Naturally growing seedlings need to be retained.

  v. Cost estimates may be prepared as stated above and may be titled as 'Eco­

- restoration of the identified degraded forests'. While preparing such cost
