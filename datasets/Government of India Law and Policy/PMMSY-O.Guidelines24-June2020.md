  PRADHAN MANTRI MATSYA SAMPADA YOJANA

  VISION

  Ecologically healthy, economically viable and socially inclusive fisheries sector that contributes towards economic prosperity and well-being of fishers, and fish farmers and other stakeholders, food and nutritional security of the country in a sustainable and responsible manner

  CHAPTER -1

1.  INTRODUCTION

    1.  India is one of the largest fish producing countries in the world and shares 7.58% to the global production. Contributing 1.24% to India‟s Gross Value Added (GVA) and 7.28% (2018-19) to the agricultural GVA, fisheries and aquaculture continue to be an important source of food, nutrition, income and livelihood to millions of people. Fisheries sector in India has shown impressive growth with an average annual growth rate of 10.88% during the year from 2014-15 to 2018-19. A comparison between the growth rate of fisheries sector GVA and National GVA is Table-1 & Graph-1. The fish production in India has registered an average annual growth of 7.53% from 2014-15 to 2018-19 (Graph-2) and stood at an all-time high of 137.58 lakh metric tons during 2018-19 (provisional). The export of marine products stood at 13.93 lakh metric tons and valued at Rs.46,589 crores (USD 6.73 billion) during 2018-19 (Graph-3) with an impressive average annual growth rate of about 10% in recent years.

    2.  The marine fisheries potential is estimated at 5.31 million tons as against present production of 4.17 million tons during 2018-19 (provisional) [harnessing nearly 78% of the estimated potential] and its activities are spread along the country‟s vast coastline with 2.02 million square km Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf area of 0.53 million sq.km. Besides, India is also bestowed with varied inland fisheries potential resources in the form of rivers and canals (1.95 lakh km), floodplain lakes (8.12 lakh hectares), ponds and tanks (24.1 lakh hectares), reservoirs (31.5 lakh hectares), brackish water (12.4 lakh hectares), saline/alkaline affected areas (12 lakh hectares) etc., with current estimated fish production potential¹of about 17 million ton as against production of 9.58 million tons during 2018-19 (provisional) [harnessing only 56.3% of potential].

    3.  Fisheries and aquaculture remain an important source of food, nutrition, employment and income for millions, especially the rural populations. In fact, the sector provides livelihood to about 25 million fishers and fish farmers at the primary level and twice the number along the value chain. Fish being an affordable and rich source of animal protein, is one of the healthiest options to mitigate hunger and nutrient deficiency. It has immense potential to enhance incomes and usher in economic prosperity to stakeholders. Hence it

  ¹ The inland fisheries potential of India is currently under review. With technology infusion, scope for productivity enhancement, area expansion, diversification etc. it is expected to be much higher than estimated 17 million tons.

  is essential that sustained and focused attention is given to the fisheries sector through policy and financial support to accelerate its development in a sustainable, responsible, inclusive and equitable manner.

4.  Further, since majority of fisher folk directly depend on the sector, especially the small scale and artisanal fishers and are continue to fall behind the national indices of socio-economic development, it is essential to provide requisite impetus towards amelioration of poverty and backwardness among these marginalized and vulnerable communities and promote their holistic development and welfare.

5.  Foreseeing the immense potential for development of fisheries and for providing focused attention to the sector, the Government of India in May, 2020 approved the “Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) – A scheme to bring about Blue Revolution through sustainable and responsible development of fisheries sector in India” with an estimated investment of Rs. 20050 crores comprising of (i) Central share of Rs. 9407 crores, (ii) State share of Rs 4880 crores and (iii) Beneficiaries contribution of Rs. 5763 crores for its implementation for a period of 5 years from FY 2020-21 to FY 2024-25 in all States/Union Territories (Figure-1).

PRADHAN MANTRI MATSYA SAMPADA YOJANA (PMMSY)

1.  The PMMSY is designed to address critical gaps in fish production and productivity, quality, technology, post-harvest infrastructure and management, modernisation and strengthening of value chain, traceability, establishing a robust fisheries management framework and fishers‟ welfare.

2.  The PMMSY is an umbrella scheme with two separate Components namely (a) Central Sector Scheme (CS) and (b) Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS). The Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) Component is further segregated into Non-beneficiary oriented and beneficiary orientated sub- components/activities under the following three broad heads:

(i) Enhancement of Production and Productivity

(ii) Infrastructure and Post-harvest Management

(iii) Fisheries Management and Regulatory Framework

      1.  Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada has been approved at a total estimated investment of Rs. 20,050 crores comprising of Central share of Rs. 9407 crores, State share of Rs 4880 crores and Beneficiaries contribution of Rs. 5763 crores (Figure-1).

      2.  PMMSY will be implemented in all the States and Union Territories for a period of 5(five) years from FY 2020-21 to FY 2024-25.

VISION

  “Ecologically healthy, economically viable and socially inclusive fisheries sector that contributes towards economic prosperity and well-being of fishers, and fish farmers and other stakeholders, food and nutritional security of the country in a sustainable and responsible manner”.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

1.  The Aims and Objectives of the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) are:

(a) Harnessing of fisheries potential in a sustainable, responsible, inclusive and equitable manner

(b) Enhancing of fish production and productivity through expansion, intensification, diversification and productive utilization of land and water

(c) Modernizing and strengthening of value chain - post-harvest management and quality improvement

(d) Doubling fishers and fish farmers incomes and generation of employment

(e) Enhancing contribution to Agriculture GVA and exports

(f) Social, physical and economic security for fishers and fish farmers

(g) Robust fisheries management and regulatory framework

FUNDING PATTERN

1.  Central Sector Scheme (CS)

(a) The entire project/unit cost will be borne by the Central government (i.e. 100% central funding).

(b) Wherever direct beneficiary oriented i.e. individual/group activities are undertaken by the entities of central government including National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB), the central assistance will be up to 40% of the unit/project cost for General category and 60% for SC/ST/Women category.

    1.  Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS)

        1.  For the Non-beneficiary orientated sub-components/activities under CSS component to be implemented by the States/UTs, the entire project/unit cost will be shared between Centre and State as detailed below:

(a) North Eastern & Himalayan States : 90% Central share and 10% State share.

(b) Other States : 60% Central share and 40% State share.

(c) Union Territories (with legislature and without legislature): 100% Central share.

    1.  For the Beneficiary orientated i.e. individual/group activities sub- components/activities under CSS component to be implemented by the States/UTs, the Government financial assistance of both Centre and State/UTs governments together will be limited to 40% of the project/unit cost for General category and 60% of the project/unit cost for SC/ST/Women. The Government financial assistance will in turn be shared between Centre and State/UTs in the following ratio:

(a) The North Eastern & the Himalayan States: 90% Central share and 10% State share.

(b) Other States: 60% Central share and 40% State share.

(c) Union Territories (with legislature and without legislature): 100% Central share (No UT Share).

  To illustrate

  If the project cost is Rs 1 lakh, the government assistance both central and state combined will be a maximum of Rs 40 thousand for general category and Rs 60 thousand for SC/ST/women. The remaining amount would be the beneficiary share. Further, the aforesaid government assistance would be shared between

  the center and state in the ratio of 90:10 for North Eastern & the Himalayan States and 60:40 for other states. As far as Union Territories (both with legislature and without legislature) are concerned, the entire government assistance i.e. 100% will be provided by Central government.

1.  One activity namely “Livelihood and nutritional support for socio economically backward, active traditional fishers‟ families for conservation of fisheries resources during fish ban/lean period” under PMMSY is continued as per the norms, guidelines and funding pattern of the Saving-cum-Relief Component of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) - Blue Revolution Scheme: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries. Accordingly, the governmental assistance of Rs 3000 per annum per enrolled beneficiary under this activity under PMMSY will be shared as detailed below:

(a) The North Eastern & the Himalayan States: 80% Central share and 20% State share.

(b) Other States: 50% Central share and 50% State share.

(c) Union Territories (with legislature and without legislature): 100% Central share.

    1.  Each enrolled beneficiary under this component is required to contribute Rs. 1500 annually. The beneficiary fishers will save Rs. 1500 over a period of 9 months during fishing season annually towards their contribution with a bank designated by the State/UT Department of Fisheries. States/UTs will devise suitable modalities to ensure transparency and smooth implementation of this activity. Depositing of beneficiary contribution on a lump sum basis in a period of one or two months may be avoided.

The nomenclature and scale of manpower, their remuneration, eligibility criteria, etc. for hiring the services of contractual manpower for operating the State Programme Unit (SPU), District Programme Unit (DPU) and the Sub- district level institutional arrangements are placed at ANNEXURE-IX. The State/UT governments will engage the services of these personnel purely on contractual basis in a transparent manner by observing all codal formalities and prescribed procedures of the States/UTs governments. The engagement of manpower under PMMSY Scheme shall be coterminous with the PMMSY Scheme. Moreover, engagement of personnel under PMMSY on contractual basis shall not confer any right claim or to any regularization or continuation of their services in Department of Fisheries, Government of India or State/Union Territory Governments at any point of time. Engagement as well as continuation of the services of the contractual manpower during the PMMSY implementation period will be subject to satisfactory performance and it can be terminated by the engaging Authority (States/UTs) without assigning any reason(s) whatsoever at any time. Department of Fisheries, Government of India will issue separate instructions with regard to the number of contractual personnel to be engaged in each State/UT for SPU/UTPU and DPU, the number of districts where the DPU will be established, the start of commencement of the engagement process, job description of the personnel, etc. Establishment of institutional arrangements/structures under PMMSY at sub-district level will be considered by Department of Fisheries, Government of India (GoI) only from second year of the implementation of the PMMSY in some potential districts as per the needs assessed by Department of Fisheries, GoI including initiatives taken up by the States/UTs for fisheries development both under PMMSY or any other Schemes of Center/States/UTs in these districts.

4.  The monthly office expenses that would be provided for each institutional arrangement/structure are also indicated at ANNEXURE-IX.

5.  The DoF wilI approve the activities/projects under Central Sector Scheme Component of PMMSY on the recommendations of the CAC and release funds to the implementing agencies. Provided the activities/projects would be appraised through the PAC of the NFDB or such other entities as may be

  decided by DoF before placing in the CAC. Support to NFDB for undertaking need-based fisheries development activities under the Central Sector Scheme Component will be based on Annual Action Plan which will be approved by DoF upon the recommendations of the CAC. Similarly, NFDB, Fisheries Institutions of DoF, Regulatory Authorities of DoF such as CAA, Directorate of Aquatic Quarantine, State Fisheries Development Boards would be strengthened by providing them with need-based supports in terms of infrastructure, etc.

6.  The DoF based on the recommendations of the CAC may fix an upper ceiling of the governmental financial assistance for individual sub- components/activities especially the beneficiary-oriented ones which in any case shall not exceed 40% of the project cost for General category and 60% of project cost for SC/ST and Women as envisaged in the Funding Pattern of the PMMSY.

7.  The States/UTs may provide additional financial assistance from their own resources over and above the governmental assistance provided under PMMSY for implementation of the intended sub- components/activities/projects, if they decide to do so for enhancing the viability, felt need, local requirements/priorities and speedy implementation.

8.  In order to maximize the coverage of the activities/projects taken up under the relevant sub-components of the Central Sector Scheme, the DoF based on the recommendations of the CAC, may fix an upper ceiling on the total cost of the individual project especially the beneficiary-oriented ones that would be supported.

9.  In order to consolidate the efforts and ensure suitable linkages and convergence with other schemes, each state/UT may formulate their respective State/UT Fisheries Vision documents and Annual Plans in sync with PMMSY.

10. The states/UTs while proposing beneficiary-oriented projects/proposals under PMMSY will also facilitate fostering of suitable linkages with banks/financial institutions including National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) and NABARD for mobilization of institutional finance wherever the beneficiaries desire to avail institutional finance.

11. The DoF would make State/UT-wise allocation of central funds on an annual basis for the Centrally Sponsored Scheme Component of the PMMSY for which requisite parameters/guidelines would be developed. Inter alia, initiatives taken by States/UTs towards policy, institutional and structural

  reforms in fisheries sector in their respective States/UTs, overall performance of States/UTs fisheries sector, efforts made by States/UTs towards sustainable fishing practices and enforcement of regulatory and management framework, having fisheries management plans in place could be some of the possible parameters for allocation of central funds under PMMSY.

12. A comprehensive PMMSY portal along with necessary Information Communication Technology (ICT) based Management Information System (MIS) will be put in place for regular monitoring of the physical and financial progress, deliverables, etc. under the scheme.

13. In order to enhance competitiveness of fisheries sector, facilitate economies of scale, generate higher incomes, accelerate growth and expansion of the sector in an organized manner, amplify outcomes, etc., to the extent possible,

  „Cluster or Area based approaches‟ will be adopted while approving and implementing the beneficiary-oriented components/activities. Some of the thrust areas for such approaches are (i) brackish-water aquaculture, (ii) mariculture including seaweed cultivation, (iii) development of resource specific deep-sea fisheries like tunas, (iv) cold water fisheries, (iv) development of aquaculture by productive utilization of saline/alkaline areas, (v) integrated development of reservoirs, etc. Under this approach, the activities will be taken up in an integrated manner with non-beneficiary oriented sub- components/activities of PMMSY and in convergence with schemes and programs of center/state/UT governments with end to end solutions.

14. Various individual sub-components/activities of PMMSY may be integrated and packaged with end to end solutions wherever feasible for maximizing the output and outcomes and may be implemented as entrepreneur/business models for encouragement of entrepreneurship and innovations, and development of fisheries entrepreneurs including „aquapreneurs‟.

15. A separate fisheries development action plan will be prepared covering fisheries related interventions and activities that would directly benefit the large number of Scheduled Caste (SC) households and encourage SC population in taking up fisheries activities under the PMMSY. The plan so prepared under PMMSY would be implemented in convergence with the appropriate schemes of the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, GoI. Focus would be given to the districts identified/covered under the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Castes (DAPSC).

16. In order to maximize the coverage of small and marginal fishers and fish farmers under PMMSY, the upper ceiling on the area eligible for support in case of individual beneficiary projects/activities will be 2 hectares per

  beneficiary. In case of beneficiary-oriented projects/activities implemented as a group activity by the Groups of fishers and fish farmers i.e. fisher SHGs/Joint Liability Groups (JLGs)/Fisher Cooperatives etc. or those undertaken in a cluster/area approach, the upper ceiling on the total area eligible for governmental assistance for each group under PMMSY will be restricted to 2 ha multiplied by the number of members of the group/society with a ceiling of 20 ha per group/society. However, a cluster/area may have multiple groups/societies. As far as FFPOs/Cs are concerned, the modalities of implementation and upper ceiling on the total area/units eligible for support under PMMSY would be decided by the CAC in order to optimize the outcomes as envisaged by DoF and/or by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.

17. Feasibility of contract farming and buy back arrangements would be explored wherever appropriate and feasible, with a view to reduce the risk of price fluctuation, stabilize fish farmers‟ incomes and to ensure assured market for the producer as well as better quality products for the fish marketing firms and consumers.

18. Emphasis will be given to promote sustainable fish production systems/methods with minimal environmental impacts (more crop per drop).

19. While implementing PMMSY, to the extent possible, „cluster or area-based approaches‟ will be adopted in order to enhance competitiveness of fisheries sector, facilitate economies of scale, generate higher incomes, accelerate growth and expansion of the sector in an organized manner, amplify outcomes, etc. Potential growth clusters/areas for development of fisheries and aquaculture will be identified and will be developed as an integrated cluster with requisite interventions/activities, forward and backward linkages and with facilities for quality brood, seed and feed, critical infrastructure, processing and marketing networks, etc. Thrust will be on water management and spatial planning supported by regulatory framework. States/UTs will designate their officers as Cluster Coordinators for handholding, monitoring and supervision of the development of clusters. The officer designated as Cluster Coordinator is required to have requisite skill sets to effectively communicate, motivate and handhold the stakeholders. The manpower engaged in SPU/DPU under PMMSY may also be entrusted with the responsibilities of Cluster Coordinators.

20. Under PMMSY particularly the technology-based interventions related to production, productivity and post-harvest, communication and/or tracking technologies, potential fishing zones (PFZ) technologies, safety kits, other MCS activities, bio toilets etc. are subject to continuous advancement/change. To

  keep pace with technological advancements/changes, the CAC taking into consideration the sectoral needs and demands will be competent to approve inclusion of devices/units of new and/or cost-effective technologies, and exclude devices/units of obsolete/unviable technologies. Further, CAC may also expand the scope of technology-based interventions including aforesaid devices/units to cover any deserving/needy class of beneficiaries/vessels etc.

DETAILED COST ESTIMATE

1.  PMMSY recognizes that cost of any development project depends on several factors such as size, project components, location, intended benefits, environmental and geographical/ topographical features, prevailing SoRs of the concerned states and prevailing market rates amongst the others.

2.  The Detailed Cost Estimate of individual/integrated project for the purpose of assessing their unit cost will be worked out by the concerned State/UT/implementing agencies/beneficiaries based on the following aspects:

(a) The project cost estimate shall be formulated based on completion of necessary surveys and assessment of condition of project location/site, planning, designing (as may be required), detailed calculation of quantity of the actual works involved etc., and adopting the approved

  Schedule of Rates of the concerned state Government/UT which are applicable/prevailing in the intended project locality.

(b) In case, no approved Schedule of Rates are available for civil works under the intended project, the unit rates in respect of such items are arrived at after detailed rate analysis which will be endorsed by the local engineering Department of the concerned State/ UT Government.

(c) In case of plant and machineries, where approved schedule of rates are not available, the estimate for such activities shall be prepared based on the rates quoted by authorised suppliers (authorised dealers).

(d) A certificate to the effect that the project cost estimate has been formulated based on the prevailing Schedule of Rates, prevailing market rates and cost is reasonable shall be provided by the concerned State/UT/Implementing agency.

    1.  The project so arrived by adopting above methodology shall be considered for approval under the PMMSY.

    2.  The ceiling of the government financial assistance will be fixed based on the prevailing unit cost fixed under the PMMSY (present unit cost costs are at ANNEXURE-I, II and III). However, the unit costs of capital-intensive infrastructure projects like fishing harbours and Aqua parks depend up on the project location, site conditions, proposed facilities, project size, SoRs of states etc. Such capital-intensive infrastructure projects will be taken up on DPR mode and the project will be funded as per actual cost within the overall fund earmarked to the respective activities under PMMSY.

    3.  Given the remoteness and difficult terrain, differential unit costs for Islands, Himalayan States/UTs and the North Eastern States would be permitted. For these States/UTs up to 20% markup would be allowed over and above the unit cost of the sub-components/activities indicated at ANNEXURE-I, II and

  III. However, it is pertinent to mention that while fixing unit costs for activities under sl-no 3 namely „Development of Fisheries in North-Eastern and Himalayan States/UTs‟ in Annexure – II, the factors like remoteness and difficult terrain have already been factored in. Therefore, the above-mentioned additional premium up to 20% will not be added to these unit costs indicated under sl-no 3 in Annexure – II.

4.  A certificate to the effect that the project cost estimate has been formulated based on the prevailing Schedule of Rates, prevailing market rates and cost is reasonable shall be provided by the concerned State/UT/Implementing agency.

CHAPTER -2

1.  RATIONALE FOR PMMSY

    1.  It has been envisioned by the government to double fishers and fish farmers‟ incomes. While the Centrally Sponsored Scheme - Blue Revolution - Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries launched in 2015-16 for a period of 5 years has made vital contributions towards development of fisheries sector, the full potential of the fisheries sector is yet to be realized due to critical gaps in quality inputs, fish genetics, investment, infrastructure, value addition, technological know-how and skilled manpower. While the demand for fish is ever increasing and given the slow pace of growth of marine capture fisheries and the fact that only 56.3% of the inland potential has been harnessed (2018-19), there is an urgent need to enhance production and productivity through targeted interventions aimed at harnessing the unrealized potential in Inland fisheries sector, aquaculture and mariculture in a responsible and sustainable manner.

    2.  It is essential to optimally harness deep sea and oceanic resources, especially the tuna resources in EEZ and high seas which fetch high value in the international market. While the area of EEZ around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands accounts for 30% of total EEZ area of India, the fish production from the EEZ of these Islands is about 1% of the estimated potential.

    3.  It is essential to expand (both horizontally and vertically), intensify and diversify inland fisheries and aquaculture, focus on diversification of species, introduction of new species and peg the critical gaps in the demand and supply of quality brood and seed of cultivable species and species-specific feeds. Adequate number of brood banks, hatcheries, seed rearing units, specific pathogen free or resistant seed, genetically improved brood stock, and feed mills have to be established.

    4.  Northeast India is a major consumer of fish and a net importer. Hence there is need for focused and region-specific interventions for promotion and development of inland fisheries and aquaculture in the North East.

    5.  Emerging concerns regarding antibiotic residues in shrimp needs to be effectively addressed in order to ensure that the marine exports continue to show a sustained double-digit growth. A system of seed and feed certification and accreditation needs to be setup. A system of end to end traceability in fish needs to be urgently put in place.

    6.  An Aquatic Animal Health Management System that effectively addresses the emergence of new and trans-boundary aquatic diseases especially in aquaculture needs focused attention.

    7.  It is also essential to promote modern methods of fish cultivation and fishing through application of modern scientific methods. There is need to develop eco-friendly diversified fishing practices for responsible and sustainable fishing.

    8.  There is considerable scope to raise incomes in fisheries sector by modernizing and strengthening the value chain. One of the key concerns is huge post-harvest losses and wastage which needs to be addressed urgently for enhancing the incomes of the stakeholders. This requires substantial investment in logistics, infrastructure and supply chain.

    9.  Post harvest hygienic handling of fish with efficient cold chain and storage are essential for enhancement of shelf life and providing quality fish to consumers. Fishing harbours and fish landing centres which are playing a vital role in ensuring safe landing, berthing and allied activities including institutional arrangement for development and management are some thrust areas required to be addressed. Modern fish markets, processing units, value addition, transportation, branding, niche labeling and traceability in fish from

  „bait to plate‟ through creation of fish documentation and network system are essential for ensuring quality and increasing profitability in the post-harvest operations and for improvement of the overall efficiency of the value chain. Further, it is essential to benchmark with global best practices.

10. Strategy and action plan with specific measures for promotion of fish consumption in domestic markets requires focused attention.

11. A robust fisheries extension system is essential for dissemination of information and knowledge about the best practices as well as the schemes and programmes amongst the intended beneficiaries along with the details of concerned EIAs and state officials.

12. It is essential to formulate fisheries management plans along with regulatory framework towards effective fisheries governance to ensure sustainable and responsible development through an ecosystem approach. Effective governance of the „Blue Economy‟ is required to strike a sustainable balance between the utilization of marine fisheries resources for securing food security of nation and livelihoods of coastal fisher communities on one hand and protection of marine ecosystems on the other.

13. Marine fishing is considered one of the riskiest professions straddled with risk to life and livelihood. Security (physical, economic and social) of traditional fishers, fish farmers and fish workers from risks associated with capture and culture fisheries including natural calamities needs to be ensured. Besides, it is also essential to ensure that fishers and their welfare are at the core of the fisheries development plans.

14. Recognizing the importance of fisheries to the economy of the country and for focused and holistic development of fisheries sector with socio economic wellbeing and welfare of fishers, fish farmers and fish workers at the core, the Government of India in February, 2019 created a separate Department of Fisheries and followed up with the creation of a new Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying in June, 2019. Further, in order to consolidate the fisheries sectoral gains, sustain growth and address some of the critical gaps in the sector in a sustainable, responsible, inclusive, and equitable manner, the government envisages to implement PMMSY.

STRATEGY

1.  Under PMMSY, focused and sustained interventions will be made for addressing the issues of fish production, productivity and quality, fisheries infrastructure and post-harvest management, modernization and strengthening of the value chain. Emphasis will be laid on harnessing of resources in a sustainable and responsible manner, addressing the critical gaps, infusion of technology and water management aimed at „more crop per drop‟, quality and hygiene in fish and fish products, steps aimed at enhancing stakeholders economic returns along the value chain combined with a robust fisheries management and regulatory framework. Priority will be given for securing and promoting the interests of traditional and small-scale fishers, marginal fish farmers and fish workers along with social, physical and economic security.

2.  While implementing PMMSY, to the extent possible, „cluster or area-based approaches‟ will be adopted in order to enhance competitiveness of fisheries sector, facilitate economies of scale, generate higher incomes, accelerate growth and expansion of the sector in an organized manner, amplify outcomes, etc. Potential growth clusters/areas for development of fisheries and aquaculture will be identified and will be developed as an integrated cluster with requisite interventions/activities, forward and backward linkages and with facilities for quality brood, seed and feed, critical infrastructure, processing and marketing networks, etc. Thrust will be on water management and spatial planning supported by regulatory framework.

3.  The broad indicative interventions are detailed below: -

(i) Enhancement of production and productivity

    (a) Under PMMSY interventions aimed at optimal harnessing of unrealized potential of inland and marine fisheries will be supported through expansion, intensification, diversification, technological infusion and productive utilization of land and water in a sustainable and responsible manner. These interventions include aquaculture, mariculture, seaweed, ornamental fish and pearl cultivation.

    (b) In both marine and inland fisheries sectors including aquaculture and mariculture, input support and facilities like national brood banks, hatcheries, rearing facilities, quality seed units including specific pathogen free or resistant seed facilitates will be provided for enhancing production and productivity. Infrastructure and systems for seed and feed certification, input quality testing, aquatic animal health management including quarantine, and disease diagnostics laboratories and referral laboratories, capacity building and establishment of extension support services will be supported.

    (c) Given the low level of harnessing of deep-sea fisheries resources in EEZ and High seas, support under PMMSY will be provided to traditional fishermen for acquiring deep sea fishing vessels, promotion of technologically advanced fishing vessels and fishing gear for fishermen/fishermen groups through State/UT governments. Training and capacity building for undertaking deep- sea fishing will be supported under PMMSY if required in collaboration with important maritime nations.

    (d) Under PMMSY, income generating economic activities like Mariculture including open sea cage cultivation, Seaweed cultivation and processing, pearl and bivalve cultivation will be supported. Potential mariculture sites along the Indian coast will be mapped and demarcated and steps will be taken for strengthening brood, seed and feed infrastructure and supply chains including large-scale seed production of prospective fish and shellfish species. Wherever possible, a cluster/area-based approach will be followed in Mariculture. Seaweed farming will be promoted in a mission mode and supported under PMMSY through financial, marketing and logistical support to ensure income and welfare gains to small fisher population especially women and fisherwomen headed households. Seaweed seed banks, nurseries, tissue culture units, processing and marketing units, etc. would be supported.

    (e) Islands offer greater opportunities for development of fisheries. Thrust will be given for fisheries development in Islands to harness their marine resources

  like tuna and other high value species, including induction of suitable technology for this purpose. Towards, this end an appropriate plan will be devised for development of fisheries in islands to harness their fisheries resources in a sustainable and responsible manner including preservation, conservation of fish stock of islands.

(f) India‟s share in the global ornamental fish industry is minimal. In view of growing domestic and export market demand, support under PMMSY will be provided for ornamental fish cultivation through requisite interventions like establishing production units, introduction of commercially important exotic species, import of breeding technology, extending technological, marketing and logistical support to entrepreneurs, etc. Support will also be given in a focused manner to promote culture of bivalves, including for pearl cultivation, and for mussels and other hitherto unexplored commercial species.

(g) On the inland fisheries front, support will be provided for fish seed stocking of reservoirs, wetlands like beels, ox-bow lakes etc., in situ hatcheries and fingerlings rearing units for open water bodies. Integrated fish farming need- based aquaculture activities in freshwater, brackish water, saline/alkaline affected soil areas and cages/pens culture, etc. will be taken up. Paddy cum fish culture will be promoted in Eastern India.

(h) Reservoirs are usually called „sleeping giants‟ because their potential is untapped. Under PMMSY support will be provided for stocking of reservoirs with quality fingerlings of Indian Major Carps and other suitable species, creation of in-situ hatcheries and fingerlings rearing units for production of quality fingerlings for stocking, integrated development of reservoirs etc. Further support will be given under PMMSY for large-scale cage cultivation in reservoirs. Similarly, wetlands like beels, ox-bow lakes, etc., have to be optimally harnessed and hence supported under PMMSY.

(i) Freshwater (pond/tanks) has huge potential for development through both expansion and intensification. By expanding the total area for aquaculture and promotion of technology backed intensification, the total fish production from fresh water aquaculture can be increased many folds. Hence, these activities will be supported under PMMSY. PMMSY will be dovetailed with MGNREGS, NRLM Scheme etc. of Department of Rural Development wherever feasible for developing fisheries in holistic manner and amplifying outcomes.

(j) Species Diversification through new candidate species having high production and market potential like Pangasius, Tilapia species, native catfishes (magur and singhi), Scampi (freshwater prawn), etc. will to be encouraged under PMMSY. Composite fish culture will also be encouraged.

(k) India‟s export growth story is primarily due to the success of brackish water aquaculture of shrimp. This sector offers huge scope for horizontal and vertical growth and needs focused attention. Under PMMSY support will be provided for quality brackish water shrimp farming to ensure sustained income transfers to the marginalized small farmers and fuel growth of exports. Given the huge export potential of shrimps, mud crab, fishes like sea bass, pangasius and tilapia, it is essential to rapidly enhance production of these export-oriented fin and shell fish in next 5 years. Towards this end there is need for area expansion, intensification and species diversification in a cluster/area approach coupled with good farm management practices and the same will be supported under PMMSY. Area expansion under PMMSY has to be focused in inland regions having alkaline and saline soils in a cluster/area approach through end-to-end interventions. Further species diversification of shrimps needs to be promoted to limit dependence upon only one species.

(l) Cold-water fisheries (trout, IMCs etc.) will be supported under PMMSY in the interest of the growth of Fisheries sector in the Himalayan states/UTs.

|   5 |   Modernization of fishing harbours of central government and its entities |   At present, the landing and berthing facilities developed or being developed can meet the needs of around 40% of the total fishing fleet. Fish importing nations are insisting on clean and hygienic landing places and there is need for modernize the fishing harbours to improve the hygienic conditions to ensure quality of fish landed. Furthermore, the existing harbours need to be modernized and required structural changes are made to suit the present requirements. Few major fishing harbours developed in the past are under the control of Port Trusts. Therefore, modernization of such fishing harbours of GoI has been considered as priority activities under the Central Sector Scheme of the PMMSY. The projects will be implemented on DPR mode.

Realizing the importance of such a programme, Department of Fisheries (DoF) has initiated a National Surveillance Programme for Aquatic Animal Diseases (NSPAAD) in 2013. Currently, this programme is being implemented in 15 states of aquaculture importance and Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, through 24 National/State Fisheries Institutes. The 2^(nd) phase of National Surveillance Programme on Aquatic Animal Diseases (NSPAAD) will be supported under PMMSY with active involvement of States/UTs. |   further strengthened and broad based.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

FFPOs/Cs will be set up with funding under PMMSY and the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare wherever possible. The cost norms, guidelines and modalities, etc. for setting up and handholding of FFPOs/Cs would be finalized by the CAC as per the specific needs and requirements of fisheries sector. For this purpose, the CAC may take the cost norms and guidelines of FFPO scheme being implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare as the basis. Wherever feasible, FFPOs/Cs would also be set up with financial assistance from other central Ministries/Departments/organizatio ns. In order to optimize the outcomes of FFPOs/Cs, the CAC would be competent to decide on the upper ceiling of the total area/number of units of a particular activity that would be supported/assisted under PMMSY for taking up by FFPOs/Cs. Efforts would also be made to foster linkages with Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, NABARD, NCDC, etc. in order to extend credit guarantee cover to the FFPOs/Cs to the extent possible. |   and guidelines of FFPO scheme being implemented by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare as the basis.                                                                               |

| 12 |   Certification, accreditation, traceability and labelling. |   A system of seed and feed certification and accreditation needs to be setup for fin fish and shell fish. Emerging concerns of presence of antibiotics and residues in shrimp needs to be effectively addressed in order to ensure that the marine exports continue to show a sustained double-digit growth. A system of end to end traceability in fish needs to be urgently put in place including use of Block chain technology. Under PMMSY, special focus will be given for establishing a comprehensive traceability and labelling system using IT applications wherever required. Certification of aquaculture inputs including seed and feed, accreditation of production units like brood banks, farms, hatcheries, supporting extension systems, etc. will be supported. | (i) Will be implemented on DPR/Self Contained Proposal basis on recommendations of CAC and approval of DoF. |

However, a cluster/area may have multiple groups/societies. As far as FFPOs/Cs are concerned, the modalities of implementation and upper ceiling on the total units eligible for support would be decided by the CAC. |

In case of space taken on lease, the lease period should be at least 7 (seven) years from the date of submission of SCP and the registered lease document shall be furnished with SCP. It is pertinent to mention that the minimum lease period has been fixed at 7 (seven) years for this minor infrastructure activity in order to encourage and attract educated unemployed youth in taking up this activity. In deserving cases, the State/UT may further relax the minimum lease period requirement from 7 (seven) years to 5 (five) years with other conditions remaining the same. |
