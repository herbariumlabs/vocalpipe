  FOREWORDS

  In order to promote sustainable agriculture for the generations to come, indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides must be checked and thereby its ill effects which may manifest in the form of environmental pollution, resistance to pesticides, depletion of soil fertility, resurgence of pests and diseases and more importantly health hazard to human beings and animals.

  Present day farmer’s attitude of relying on single tactic of chemical control has to be changed and replaced by suitable mix of different pest control methods in an integrated manner. This is a challenge before the field functionaries of the department of Agriculture, Assam. I.P.M. is dynamic and problem oriented. For this, our field officers have to know all the technologies available and update knowledge on the changes.

  I.P.M. package of practices for field crop is a long felt need for the field functionaries and farmers. There is no crop wise guide book on I.P.M. practices for taking up suitable field activities as well as planning I.P.M. relevant to crop, pest, location and cropping pattern.

  I hope, this book on package of practices for different crops will certainly help the field functionaries in guiding the farmers for adoption of I.P.M. practices in the years to come.

Preface

  Integrated Pest Management (IPM) package of practices on different crops have been prepared and published by the Directorate of Plant Protection, Quarantine and Storage, Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of India with the technical inputs from experts of Indian Council of Agricultural Research, State Agricultural Universities, Central Directorate of Plant Protection, Pesticide Industries and State Departments of Agriculture/Horticulture in the management of pests, diseases, weeds, nematodes and rodents.

  Fine tuning of the IPM packages of some of the field crops, spices included in this booklet had been done having interfaces with scientists of Assam Agricultural University and concerned officers of the State Department of Agriculture, Assam to make it relevant to the pests and diseases scenario of the state.

  IPM is a dynamic and constantly evolving approach, its components as well as tactics should change as the situation warrants. As such transfer of technology to the farmers is a challenging task before the field functionaries. Training of farmers in crop production and protection methods, identifying pests, their natural enemies, concept of damage on economic injury levels, knowing agro-ecosystem and its analysis are very important which empower the farmers to take their own decisions.

  It is hoped that these packages of IPM practices on important crops shall help the field level extension workers in guiding the farmers towards achieving that goal.

Pest Monitoring :

a.  Agro Ecosystem Analysis (AESA) :

  AESA is an approach which can be gainfully employed by extension functionaries and farmers to analyse field situations with regard to pests, defenders, soil conditions, plant health, the influence of climatic factors and their interrelationship for growing healthy crop. Such a critical analysis of the field situations will help in situations will help in taking appropriate decision on management practices. The basic components of AESA are :

i.  Plants health at different stages. Monitor symptoms of diseases and nematodes.

ii. Built-in-compensation abilities of the plants.

iii. Pest and defender population dynamics.

iv. Soil conditions.

v.  Climatic factors.

vi. Farmers past experience.

The methodology of AESA is as under :

b.  Field Observations :

    i.  Enter the field at least 5 ft. away from the bund. Select a site with a dimension of 1 sq mt. randomly.

    ii. Record the visual obervation in following sequence:

        a.  Flying insects (both pests & defenders)

        b.  Close observation on pests and defenders which remain on the plants.

        c.  Observe pests like borer, BPH etc. and defenders like cooccinellid, chrysopa, ground beetle/rove beetle and earwigs etc, by scrapping the soil surface around the plants.

        d.  Record disease and its intensity.

        e.  Record insects damage and disease incidence in percentage.

    iii. Record parameters like number of leaves, plant height and reproductive parts of the selected plants for making observation in the following weeks. Observe nematode damage symptoms.

    iv. Record the types of weeds, their size and population density in relation to crop plant.

    v.  Record soil conditions viz flooded, wet or dry.

    vi. Observe rodent live burrows.

    vii. Record the climatic factors viz sunny, partially sunny, cloudy, rainy etc. for the preceding week.

Drawing :

  First draw the plant at the centre on a chart. Then draw pests on left side and defender on the right side. Indicate the soil condition, weed population, rodent damage etc. Give natural colours to all the drawing, for instance, draw healthy plant with green colour, diseased plant/leaves with yellow colour. While drawing the pests and the defenders on the chart care should be taken to draw them at appropriate part of the plant, where they are seen at the time of observation. The common name of pest and alongwith diagram. The weather factor should be reflected in the chart by drawing the diagram of sun just above the plant if the attribute is sunny. If cloudy, the clouds may be drawn in place of sun. In case of partially sunny, the diagram of sun may be half masked with clouds.

Group Discussion and Decision making :

  The observations recorded in the previous and current charts should be discussed among the farmers by raising questions relating to change in pest and defender population in relation to crop stages, soil condition, weather factors such as rainy, cloudy or sunny etc. The group may evolve a strategy based upon weekly AESA, ETL and corresponding change in P.D. ratio and take judicious decision for specific post management practices.

Strategy for decision making :

  Some of the defenders like lady beetles, groundnut beetles, rove beetles, wasps play useful role in arriving at P.D. ratio.

AESA by Extension Functionaries :

  The extension functionaries during their regular visit to the village mobilize the farmers, conduct AESA and critically analyse the various factors such as the pest population vis-a-vis defender population and their role in natural suppression of the pest, the influence of per

  prevailing weather condition/soil conditions on the likely build-up of defender/pest population. They may also take the decision based on the AESA which IPM components like release of defenders, application of need formulations/ safe pesticides are to be used for specific pest situation. Such an exercise may be repeated by the extension functionaries during every visit to the village and motivate the farmers to adopt AESA in their fields.

AESA by Farmers :

  After a brief exposure during IPM demonstrations/ field trainings, farmers can practice AESA in their own field. Whenever trained farmers are available their experiences could be utilized in training their fellow farmers in their own villages. Thus a large group of farmers could be made proficiently competent in undertaking weekly AESA thereby empowering themselves in decision making on any specific pest situations. Farmers-to-farmers training approach will go a long way in practicing IPM on a large area on sustainable basis.

Survey/ Field Scouting :

  The objective of surveys through roving surveys is to monitor the initial development of pest and diseases in endemic areas. Therefore, in the beginning of crop season survey routes based upon the endemic areas are required to be identified to undertake roving surveys. Based upon the results of the roving surveys, the state extension functionaries have to concentrate for grater efforts at block and village levels as well as through farmers to initiate field scouting. Therefore, for field scouting farmers should be mobilized to observe the pest and disease occurrence at the intervals as stipulated hereunder. The plant protection measures are required to be taken only when pests and diseases cross ETL as

  results of field scouting.

1.  Roving survey : Undertake roving at every 10 km.distance initially at weekly intervals and thereafter at 10 days

  intervals (depending upon pest population). Everyday at least 20 spots should be observe.

2.  Field scouting : Field scouting for pests and bio-control fauns by extension agencies and farmers once in 3 – 5 days should be undertaken to workout ETL.

Pest Monitoring Through Pheromones/ Light Traps etc.

  Certain pests required positioning of various kinds of traps like pheromones, light trap to monitor the initial pest build up. Therefore, the State Department of Agriculture is to initiate action for positioning of different kinds of traps at strategic locations at village level as per the following details.

1.  Pheromone trap – 8 traps per ha. may be used to monitor stem borer moth population in Summer rice initiate in February to April (Boro & Early Ahu) trapping should be done from February to April and in Winter rice –(Sali rice), it should be done from July to September lures should be replaced at 10 days intervals.

2.  Light trap - Chinsurah light trap or any other light trap with 200 watts mercury lamps can be operated for two hours in the evening to observe photo tropic insect pests. Traps should be placed away from other light sources.

3.  Sweep-nets-water pans – Besides visual observations sweep-nets and water pans may also be used to assess the population of insect pests and bio-control agents.

A.  Cultural practices

    1.  Summer ploughing trimming of bunds and destruction of crop residues.

    2.  Selection of healthy seeds or resistant/tolerant varieties (Annexure II).

    3.  Seed treatment (for diseases).

    4.  Early and timely planting/ sowing.

    5.  Raising of healthy nursery.

    6.  Seedling root dip/ nursery treatment in gall midge stemborer endemic areas.

    7.  Destruction of left over nursery, removal of weeds from field and cleaning of bunds.

    8.  Normal spacing as per recommendations.

    9.  Clipping of rice seedling tips before planting. But this should be avoided in BLB endemic areas.

    10. 30 cm. alley formation at every 2 to 3 m. distance in planthopper and sheath blight endemic area.

    11. Balanced use of fertilizers and micro-nutrients as per local recommendations.

    12. Proper water management (alternate wetting and drying to avoid water stagnation) in planthopper endemic areas.

    13. Removal and destruction of affected plant or plant parts.

    14. Destruction of alternate host in swampy areas during off season.

    15. Avoid staggered planting.

    16. In case of late planting during Sali use aged seedling (40-45 old)

Mechanical Practices

1.  Collection of egg masses and leaves of pest and their placement cages for conservation of bio-control agents.

2.  Use of coir rope soaked in one part of kerosene and one part of water in rice crop for dislodging case worm, leaf folder leave etc.

  9

  10

3.  Paddy weeder should be used at 30-35 DAT to suppress weed population.

4.  Hispa infested leaves should be clipped at 6^(th) – 9^(th) and destroyed by burning or burying. Alternately, leaves of infested plants may be beaten with thorny twigs like ber etc. to injure and expose the grubs and pupae.

Biological Control

1.  Conservation :

    1.  Bio-control agents viz, spider, drynids, water bugs, mirid bugs, damsel flies, dragonflies, meadow grasshoppers, staphylinid beetles, carabids, coccinellide, Apanteles, Tetrastchus, Telenomus, Trichogramma, Bracon, Platygaster etc. should be conserved.

    2.  Root dip treatment of rice seedlings with chlorpyriphos is safe for the natural enemies i.e. gall midge endemic areas.

    3.  As an alternate to seedling root dip, apply 1.5 kg. a.i./ ha of carbofuran or phorate granules in nursery 5 days before uprooting the seedlings for control of insect pests in early transplanted crop.

    4.  Place bamboo tops or twings for perching of predatory birds soon after planting. However these are to be remove at flowering stage of the crop.

    5.  Collection of egg masses of borers and putting them in a bamboo case cum-percher till flowering which will permit the escape of egg parasites and trap and kill the hatching larvae. Besides, these would allow perching of predatory birds.

 Augmentation:

  Augmentative release of Trichogramma japonicum or

  T. Chilonis@50,000/ha/week 6-8 release should be made starting from 30 days of transplanting for control of stem borer and leaf folder respectively.

Pest Defender ratio :

  2.1 Ratio may be useful to avoid application of pesticides.

4.  Spraying of Beauveria bassiana (at a concentration of 107 spores/ ml@400-700 1/ha. In general 3 kg/ha of the medium impregnated with B. bassiana is required per hectare.

Behavioral Control :

  Mass trapping of yellow stem borer male moths by installing pheromone traps at the rate of 20 traps/ha 10 days after transplanting. Lures containing 5 mg pheromone mixture of Z, 11 hexadecenal & 2-9 hexadecemal (at 3:1 ratio) should be replaced 3-5 times during crop season.

Chemical Control Measures :

  Need based, judicious and safe application of pesticides are the most vital tripartite segments of chemical control measures under the ambit of IPM. It involves developing IPM skill to pay safe with environment by proper crop health monitoring observing ETC and conserving bio-control potential before deciding in favour of chemical pesticides as a last resort.

Weed Management Practices :

1.  In Direct Sown Rice :

  The problem of weeds under direct sown rice growing condition are more than in transplanted rice. This is particularly so when crop is sown by broad casting. Major weeds of these situations are panicum sp. Echinochloa

  11

  12

  crusgalli, cyperus iria, Cyperous diformis, Commelina benghalenses, Eclipta alba, Ischaemum rugosum, Eleusine indica, Amaranthus spinosus.

Weed Management :

a.  By ensuring thorough land preparation, the weed can be minimized. Summer ploughing is generally recommended for facilitating stubble management as well as weed control. Rain water conservation, preparation of stale seed bed before sowing by way of providing one round harrowing and leveling after the land preparation to minimize weeds. The fields should be given summer ploughing to destroy perennial weeds. Stale seed bed should prepared by thorough seed bed preparation.

b.  Timely sowing of crop may be encouraged to minimize crop weed competition.

c.  The crop should be sown in lines at recommended spacing to facilitate inter-weeding operation. The mechanical methods of weed management should be practiced after 2-3 weeks and second time if necessary after 4-6 weeks of sowing.

d.  Apply Butachlor 2 kg a.i/ha at 2-3 days after sowing following by 1 mechanical weeding at 30-35 days after sowing.

e.  2-4 D @ 0.8 kg. a.i/ha as post emergence at 2-3 leaf stage of the dicot weeds and sedges or 25-30 days after emergence.

Under Low Land Rice :

1.  Major weeds under these situations are Echinochloa colomn, Echinochloa crusgalli, Cyperus iria, Monochoria vaginalis indica, Digitaria setigera, Ischaemum rugosum, Fimbristylis littoralis and Fiss endocarpa linifalia.

 Weed Management :

a.  Bunds and irrigation channels should be kept free from weeds.

b.  Summer ploughing should be practices wherever possible to destroy perennial weed vegetation.

c.  Stale seed bed should be prepared wherever possible and pudding should be done immediately before transplanting of rice.

d.  As far as possible rice seedling should be free from weed seedling at the time of transplanting.

e.  Optimum plant population and application of recommended rate of nutrients would help to ensure adequate density of plant population which could minimize the competition from weeds.

f.  Maintain a thin layer of water on the soil surface to minimize weed growth under such conditions.

g.  Early weeding 3-4 weeds after transplanting in case where me- chanical methods are to be used.

h.  One hand weeding may be given 4-6 weeds after transplanting if necessary.

i.  Apply Butachlor, Pendimethalin or Thiobencarb @ 1.5 kg. a.i./ha or Pretilachlor @ 0.5 to 0.75 kg.a.e./ha. Or Loxadiargyl @ 100 g.a.i./ ha or Chlorimuron ethyl @ 6-8 g.a.e./ha or Metsulfuron methyl @ 4 g a.e./ha or Anilophos @ 0.4 g a.i./ha as pre-emergence within 4-6 days after transplanting.

j.  Apply Metsulfuron methyl + Chlorifuran methyul @ 4-6 g a.i./ha or Anilophos + 2-4 D @ 300-480 g a.i./ha at 3-10 days after transplanting.

Nematode Management Practices :

  Nematode Management practices are essential for obtaining the desired yield potential of rice crop. Important nematodes and their management approaches are as under –

1.  Write tip nematode (Apheienchides bessryi)

    1.  Hot water treatment of seed at 52⁰C for 10 minutes after a presoak for 6 hours.

    2.  Sun drying seeds for 6 hours for 4 days.

    3.  Burning stubbles to prevent any carryover infection.

    4.  Pre-sowing of nursery bed treatment with carbofurn 3G granules @ 33 kg./ha.

    5.  Pre-soaking resistant varieties like Ratna, Triveni, TMK, TMK 9 Surya, Kaveri, Indira.

2.  Rice Root Nematode (Hirschmannidla aryzae)

    1.  Application of neem cake at 100-120 kg/ha.

    2.  Grow resistant varieties like TMK 9, Annapurna in endemic areas.

    3.  Pre-sowing treatment of nursery bed with Carbofurn 3G granules @ 33kg/ha.

    4.  Seed soaking with 0.2% solution of Monocrolophos for 6 hours.

    5.  Soil application of Carbofuran 3G @ 33 kg/ha.

    6.  Growing Sesbania rostrata as intercrop.

    7.  Growing potato or groundnut as rotation crops.

 Ufra (Ditylenchus angustus) – Assam, West Bengal

1.  Destruction of ratoon crops.

1.  Summer ploughing.

2.  Delayed planting.

3.  Rotation with non-host crops like Jute or Sesamum.

4.  Seed treatment with Carbosulfan 25 ST.

5.  Soil application of Carbofuran 3G @ 33 kg/ha.

6.  Growing an early variety like Padmapani, which can escape the nematode in endemic areas.

4.  Root knot nematode (Meloidogyne graminicola)

    1.  Rotation with the crops like Sweet potato, Sunflower, Cowpea, Sesamuan, Onion.

    2.  Growing resistant varieties like TKM-6 Hamsa, IR64 and Ramakrishna in endemic areas.

    3.  Soil application of Carbofuran 3G @ 33 kg/ha.

5.  Cyst Nematode (Heterodera oryzae) – Kerala only

    1.  Growing resistant varieties like Alaknanda-41, Hamsa, TKM 6, MTU-17, CR-143-2-2 in endemic areas.

    2.  Soil treatment with Carbofurn 3G @ 33 kg/ha.

Rodent Management Practices :

  (Working Index (ETL : Fifteen live burrows per hectare)

1.  Bund trimming specially to minimize rodent harbourage.

2.  Weed management to reduce alternate source of food. Remove ulubon (Elencine indica) from the bunds.

3.  Employment of indigenous traps preferably one month after trans- plantation.

4.  Six weeks after transplantation application of bromodiolone (0.005% a.i.) in baits.

5.  The residual live burrows may be treated with second application of bromodiolone (0.005%).

  15

  16

6.  The above operations with rodenticides except Zinc phosphide (as rodents develop bait shyness) may be repeated if the rodent popu- lation exceeds working index.

Important :

i.  Optimum period or undertaking control operation is six week after transplantation.

ii. Zinc phosphide (2.5%) in baits may be applied in rodent outbreak situation.

iii. For effective control, it is recommended that Zinc, Phosphide with ISI mark in 10 gm pouches preferably in manufacturers package should be procured.

Procedure for Seedling Root Dip

  A smooth area of 10x1 cm can be bounded strongly on all sides. A polythene sheet of 10.5x1.5 m is spread over the area touching the soils surface and extended along the bunds up to a height of 10-15 cm. Let it water to a depth of about 2 cm and add 200 ml of chlorpyriphos (20EC) and mix thoroughly. Uprooted rice seedlings required to plant one acre closely arranged immersing roots in insecticide solution (0.02%). All these operations are done towards evening and seedlings are allowed to remain in the insecticide solution over night (for 12 hours) and are transplanted next day morning. In case of time shortage, add 1% urea to insecticide emulsion in bounded area and mix thoroughly. Dip roots in this solution for 3 hours and plant.

  The objective of surveys is to monitor the initial development of pests and diseases in endemic areas. In the beginning of crop season routes based upon the endemic areas are required to be identified to undertake roving survey. Based upon the results of the roving surveys, the extension functionaries have to concentrate for greater efforts at block and village levels as well as through farmers to initiate field scouting. Farmers should be mobilized to observe the pest and disease occur- rence by field scouting at the intervals as stipulated here under. The plant protection measures are required to be taken only when pests and diseases cross ETL as per results of field scouting.

Rapid Roving Survey :

  Undertake roving survey at every 10 km initially at weekly intervals and thereafter at 10 days intervals (depending upon the pest and dis- ease incidence) in pre-fixed routes. Record incidence of pests/ dis- eases of the crop.

  In case of nematodes, particularly in the month of February (ear head stage), special attention should be given to monitor incidence of cereal cyst nematode exhibiting symptoms like stunted growth, yel- lowing, less tillering and pearl like white females attached to the root- lets. For seed gall nematodes, field showing symptoms of curling, crinking and twisting of leaves with spread out ones may be identified to avoid harvest of produce for the purpose of seed material.

Trap Plot Nurseries (TPN) :

  Such nurseries are planted at various strategic locations and regu- lar watch is kept for the occurrence of the pests. Such type of nurseries, usually contain varieties or entries with known genetic constitution so that occurrence or appearance of a new race or pest could be identified. The trap plot nurseries (TPN) is planted at multiplications including those all along the western border. It helps in knowing the first appearance of disease, disease progress, disease situation and appearance of new variants or races or resistant materials. This also helps in monitoring the entry of new races (pathotypes) from across the border, specially for the yellow rust. Distribution pattern of the rust virulence (races) provides much needed indications for executing the resistant gene deployment, thus helping in preparedness for the future.

Field Scouting :

  Field scouting should be undertaken by the farmers and extension functionaries for keeping a lose watch on the appearance of diseases, insect pests and bio-control fauna.

  During the visit to the field, a diagonal path should be followed. During the first course through the field, only occurrence of pests is recorded whereas during the second course, quantitative information is also re- corded on 5 randomly selected spots of one metre row length/5 plants.

(a) First passage

(b) Second passage showing five sites for date recording.

  Pest infestation, resulting damage in scattered patches in the field like root diseases, termite and nematodes should be scouted.

Agro-Eco System Analysis (AESA) :

  AESA is an approach which can be gainfully employed by extension functionaries and farmers to analysis field situations with re- gard to pests, defenders, soil conditions, plant health, the influence of climatic factors and their inter-relationship for growing healthy crop. Such a critical analysis of the situation will help in taking appropriate decision on management practices. The basic components of AESA are :

i)  Plant health at different stages. Monitor symptoms of diseases and nematodes.

ii) Built-in-compensation abilities of the plants.

iii) Post and defender population dynamics.

iv) Soil conditions.

v)  Climatic factors

vi) Farmer’s past experience.

Economic Threshold Level (ETL) :

1.  Nemeatodes :

    1.  2 eggs/larvae per gm of soil for cereal cyst nematode.

    2.  1 percent mixture of seed galls with healthy seeds for seed gall nematodes.

 Insect Pests :

1.  Aphids

  i) Five aphids per ear head

  Armyworm and American pod borer (Helicothis) 4 to 5 larvae per metre row.

Rodents :

i)  25 live burrows/hectare.

ii) Damage index 2 percent tiller damage (diagonal method)

  During AESA observations, small stem bits damaged by the ro- dents may be noted, which indicated the presence of reproducing/lactat- ing females.

Integrated Pest Management Strategies :

1.  Cultural Practices :

1.  Summer deep ploughing and burning of stubbles/residue of previ- ous crop.

2.  Grow moderately aphid resistant/tolerant varieties-like UP-262 and WH-291.

  4.2.3. Rogueing of ‘dead heart’ plants & loose smut infested plants at early stage of attack.

4.  Crop rotation with non host crops (other than maize, rice, fodder jawar etc.) against pink borer attack

5.  Collect seeds from disease free source.

6.  Use well rotten cowdung manure/compost to avoid termites.

7.  Avoid late sowing of wheat to save the crop from aphid and army worm.

8.  Use only recommended dose of nitrogenous fertilizer excess nitrogen attract insects and diseases.

9.  Maintain frequent surveillance of crop field for timely management of pests.

10. In rodent infested fields trimming of field bunds should be done to destroy existing rodent burrows. Existing rodent burrows should be collapsed by flooding the field.

11. Application of neem cake (250 kg/ha) suppress cutworm.

12. Clean cultivation – one hand weeding at 45 days.

13. Flooding against cricket and rodents.

  27

  28

2.  Dismantle termataria (monde) around fields & kill the termite queen.

3.  Biological Control :

    1.  Conservation and exploitation of biocontrol agents like coccinellid beetles, chrysopa, syrphid, Apanteles etc. by spot & strip application of insudae against aphid attack.

    2.  Fix bird perches of 5ft hight to attract insectivorous birds like swellow, Mayana, rodentivorus birds like owls. After flowering of crop bird perches should be removed.

4.  Chemical Control :

    1.  Seed Treatment :

  For Termite : Treat seeds before sowing with any of the following insecticides. Chlorpyriphos

  @ 4 ml/kg of seeds. Endosulfan @ 7 ml/kg of seeds.

  For Loose Snut : Treat seeds before sowing with arboxin/

  arbendazim @ 1 gm/kg.

2.  Soil treatment : For cutworm cricket or termite endemic field

  apply 25-30 kg of Malathion 5% dust or Endosulfan 4% dust at soil preparation.

3.  Insecticide spray :

  For Aphid & Thrips : Endosulfan 2 ml/lit of water

  Or Monocrotophos 1 ml/lit of water

Or

  Oxydenmeton methyl 1 ml/lit of water Or

  Dimethoate 1 ml/lit of water.

  For Army worm : Fenitrothion 2 ml/lit of water (Spray in evening hours for better control)

  Or Diclorvos 1 ml/lit of water

  Or Endosulfan 1 ml/lit of water

  For Pink borer : Quinalphos 2 ml/lit of water

  Or Monocrotophos 1 ml/lit of water

  Or Dimethoate 1 ml/lit of water.

  For Rodents : Place bromadiolone 0.005% bait

  (15 gm/furrow) is live when the infestation level Furrows is live burrow/ha.

3. Pest Monitoring :

  The objective of pest monitoring is to detect the initial de- velopment of pest and disease and also the bio-control potentials in the field situation.

1.  Rapid Roving Survey (RRS) : Survey routes should be identified with the beginning of the crop season in the pest and disease endemic areas to undertake Rapid Roving Surveys (RRS). Monitoring and Surveillance of almost all the important pests should be done regu- larly i.e. weekly in general and twice a week during seeding/flower- ing/pod formation stage. During survey the observations are to be made at every 10 kms. distance in pre-selected routes. For mustard aphid, monitoring activities will have to be intensified from first week of December onwards. Record the incidence of pest, disease and defender populations in 30 to 40 randomly selected per ha.

2.  Field Scouting : Based on the observation of RRS, the farmers at village level are to be mobilized to undertake field scouting. During field scouting, farmers may record pest, disease and defenders population twice a week in their own fields as per Agro-Eco-system Analysis (AESA) approach. (The State Department of Agriculture should make all possible efforts by using different media, mode and publicity to inform the farmers the need for field scouting in the spe- cific crop areas having indication of pest or disease buildup.)

3.  Agro Eco-System Analysis (AESA) : AESA is an approach which can be gainfully employed by extension functionaries and farmers to analyse field situations with regard to pests, defenders, soil con- ditions, plant health, the influence of climatic factors and their inter relationship for growing healthy crop. Such a critical analysis of the field situation will help in taking appropriate decision on manage- ment practices.

1.  Plant health at different stages (Phenophases)

2.  Built-in-compensation abilities of the plants.

3.  Pest and defender population dynamics.

4.  Soil conditions and edaphic factoes.

5.  Climatic factors-temperature, RH and rainfall, etc.

6.  Farmers experience of pest, diseases and weeds etc.

 4. Economic Threshold Levels (ETLs) :

  To determine ETL of mustard aphid, observe 30 to 40 widely scattered plant per location/field once a week and then count the number of aphids (nymphs and adults) on the top 10 cm length of the terminal shoot; or observe 250 plant/ha, selected randomly from all the sides of the field to work out the per cent plant infested.

IPM Strategies :

A.  Cultural Practices :

    1.  Deep ploughing soon after harvest, wherever possible.

    2.  Destruction of debrises of previous crop.

    3.  Grow aphid resistant or tolerant varieties like Varuna, TM-2 & TM-4.

    4.  Early sowing (2^(nd) fortnight of October) of the crop to escape mustard aphid attack.

    5.  Use recommended dose of fertilizer.

    6.  Irrigate the crop at early pod formation stage to reduce painted bug incidence.

Mechanical Practices :

1.  Collection and destruction of egg mass and early instar (gragarious phase) larvae of cabbage caterpillar and hairy caterpillar.

2.  Remove aphid infested twigs and destroy the aphids.

3.  Hand picking and destruction of sawfly larvae in the morning hours.

4.  Removal and destruction of leaf webbers along with the webbed leaves.

Bio-logical Control Practices :

  Conserve the natural bio-control agents viz. cocoincllids, chrysophids and syrphid by selecting safe insecticides (endosulfan is safer for predators and pollinators), proper timing of spray (Evening hours) by following only need base application of insecticide.

  ★Don’t apply malathion after flowering in order to spare pollinators like honey bee.

  ★★Spot application in case of early attack and strip application when the infestations is uniform against aphids.

Diseases :

  Seed treatment with Matalaxyl (like Agvon 35 WS) @ 6 gm/kg to eleminate downy mildew and white rust of rapeseed and Mencozeb 75% WP @ 3 gm/kg of seed for Altermaria blight is recommended.

  Spray Mencozeb 75% WP @ 2 gm/lit to control Alternaria blight, Downy mildew or white rust.

  There is no problem of nematode pest in these crop. However mus- tard is a antagonistic crop or enemy crop for nematode pest. The crop is recommended as trap crop for crop rotation or mixed crop with veg- etables/pulses for reduction of root knot and reniform nematodes.

Weed Management :

  Crop should be sown timely at proper moisture by using rec- ommended seed rate, balances dose of fertilizer to achieve optimum population and healthy crop stand which would be capable of compet- ing with weeds at initial stage of crop growth.

  Crop should be maintained weed free initially for 45 days after sow- ing by restoring to hand hoeing/weeding at 20 and 40 days after sow- ing.

Potential Natural Enemies of Mustard Pests :

A.  Chrysopa : Green lacewing, adults are delicate, light green in- sects with net like wings. The eggs are laid on the stalks. It grubs posses sickle shaped mouth parts, wander on plants in search of soft bodied insects pray vigourously on them.

B.  Lady Bird Beetles : They are predatory. The eggs are yellowish, grubs are usually blackish or blackish with yellow. Orange or red mark- ings. Adults are brightly coloured (reddish, Yellowish, Black, Orange red) bettles with over upper side. The adults and feed on aphids.

C.  Syrphid fly : The larvae are whitish in colour having sharp mouth parts which feed on aphids. The adults are not predaceous. These are also hoverfly and look like slender house fly.

Agro Eco System Analysis (AESA) :

  AESA is an approach which can be gainfully employed by exten- sion functionaries and farmers to analyse field situations with regard to posts, defenders, soil conditions. Plants health, the influence of cli- matic factors and their interrelationship for growing healthy crop. Such a critical analysis of the field situations will help in taking appropriate decision on management practices.

  The basis components of AESA are :

1.  Plant health at different stages (Phenophases)

2.  Built-in compensation abilities of the plants.

3.  Pest and defender population dynamics.

4.  Soil conditions and edaphic factors.

  37

  38

5.  Climatic factors temperature, RH, rainfall, etc.

6.  Farmers experience of pest, diseases and weeds etc.

  The methodology of AESA is as under :

Field Observations :

a)  Enter the field at least two ft. away from the bund. Select a site with a dimension of 1 sq.mt. randomly.

b)  Record the visual observations in following sequences :

    i)  Flying insects (both pests & defenders)

    ii) Close observation on pests and defenders which remain on the plants.

    iii) Record disease and its intensity.

    iv) Record insect damage in percentage or population/plant.

c)  Record parameters like number of leaves, branches, plant height and reproductive parts of the selected plants which should be flagged for making observation in the following weeks.

d)  Record the types of weeds, their size and population density in relation to crop plant.

e)  Record soil conditions viz. flooded, wet or dry.

f)  Observe rodent live burrows.

g)  Repeat the step (a) to (f) in four sites randomly selected.

h)  Record the climatic factor viz. sunny, partially sunny, cloudy, rainy etc. for the preceding week.

Drawings :

  First draw the plant with actual number of branches/leaves etc. at the centre on a chart. Then draw pests on left side and defender on the right side. Indicate the soil condition, weed population, rodent damage etc. Give natural colour to all the drawing, for instance, draw healthy plant with green colour, diseased plant/leaves with yellow colour, while drawing the pests and the defenders on the chart care should be taken to draw them at appropriate part of the plant, where they are seen at the time of observation. The common name of pest and defenders and their population count should also be given along with diagram. The weather factor should be reflected in the chart by drawing the diagram of sun just above the plant if the attribute is sunny. If clouds may be drawn in place of sun. In the case of partially sunny, the diagram of sun may be half marked with clouds.

 Group Discussion and decision making :

  The observations recorded in the previous and current charts should be discussed among the farmers by raising questions relating to change in pest and defender population in relation to crop stages, soil condi- tion, weather factors such as rainy, cloudy or sunny, etc. The group may evolve a strategy based upon weekly AESA, ETL and correspond- ing change in P : D ratio and take judicious for specific pest management practices.

Strategy for decision making (Examples) :

  Some of the defenders like lady beetles, hrysoperia, syrphids, etc. play useful role in arriving at P : D ratio. Detailed list description is at Annexure –II.

AESA By Extension Functionaries :

  The extension functionaries during their regular visit to the village mobilize the farmers, conduct AESA and critically analyse the various factors such as the pest population vis-à-vis defender population and their role in natural suppression of the pest, the influence of prevailing weather condition/soil conditions on the likely build up of defender/pest population. They may also take the decision based on the AESA, which IPM components like release of defenders, application of safe pesti- cides are to be used for specific pest situation. Such an exercise may be repeated by the extension functionaries during every visit to the village and motivate the farmers to adopt AESA in their fields.

AESA By Farmers :

  After a brief exposure during IPM demonstrations/field training, farm- ers can practice AESA in their own fields. Wherever trained farmers are available their experiences could be utilized in training their fellow farmers in their own villages. Thus a large group of farmers could be made be proficiently competent in undertaking weekly AESA thereby empowering themselves in decision making on any specific pest situa- tions. Farmers-to-farmers training approach will go a long way in prac- ticing IPM on a large area on sustainable basis.

Pest monitoring :

1.  Survey teams should undertake regular insect pest and disease monitoring on pre-selected routes at 15 days interval and as- sess bio-control potential in addition to insect pest and disease situ- ation to give early forewarnings. Record should be kept about inset pest and disease incidence and bio-potential fauna on 5 plants per spot se- lected randomly at 10 spots per ha. after every 10 km. distance.

Field scouting :

  Field scouting should be undertaken by the farmers/extension functionaries to keep a close watch on the appearance of insect pest, disease and bio-control fauna.

Agro-eco System Analysis (AESA) :

  Based upon weekly AESA, Economic threshold level (ETL) and corresponding change in pest defender ratio, the extension functionaries have to take judicious decision in advising farmers for specific pest management practices.

Integrated Pest Management Strategies :

1.  Cultural practices :

    1.  Deep ploughing, early sowing and timely irrigation is important for a good crop stand.

    2.  Keep the crop weed free upto 5^(th) node stage (Upto 5 to 6 weeks)

  to reduce attack of flea beetle, leaf folder and pod bugs. However, keep a weedy patch near the field for sheltering of natural en- emies.

3.  Resistant/tolerant varieties are recommended for cultivation. Some of the varieties showing resistance are as given below :

Mechanical practices :

1.  Hand pick and destroy the eggs or 1^(st)/2^(nd) instar larvae of hairy caterpillar which remain in clusters in few leaves. Light trap is also effective against hair caterpillar.

2.  At the initiation of aphid attack apical plant parts with aphid colonies should be lipped and destroyed.

3.  Collect and destroy leaf folders/rollers in the initial stage of leaf folder attack.

4.  Sweeping of hand net over the crop/between the rows to collect and destroy the nymphs and adults of pod bug and green stink bug.

Chemical control:

  Against aphids, jassids and flea beetle, spray malathion 50 EC at 0.1% concentration (2 ml/lit of water). Spraying of endosulfan 35 EC at 0.07% concentration (2 ml/lit of water) may be followed against pod bugs, leaf folder, white fly and hairy caterpillar. Soil application of phorate 10 G @ 0.5 kg. a.i./ha or Carbofuran 3 G @0.5 kg. a.i./ha against leaf folder, flea beetle, jassid, stemfly and white fly in summer as well as kharif crop.

  Spraying should be done only at ETL. Against aphids, spraying should be done in alternate strips in the afternoon to conserve natural enemies (Coccinella repanda, Lemnia biplagiata, Micraspis discolor, Menochilus sexmanculatus, Coccinella septempunctata and Ischidon sctellaris). Untreated strips should be sprayed after 3 days.

  Spraying against pod bugs and green stink bug should be avoided if natural enemies like – Thomisus sp. (Spider predator), Trissolcus sp. (egg parasitoid) or Tyrophagous putreacentiae (mite predator) are abundant in the field.

  Similarly, no spraying should be done against leaf folder if natural enemies like Ophionia indica (predatory bettle), Oxyopes ratnae (predatory spider), Marpissa tikaderi (predatory spider) and Megaselia scalaris (larval pupal parasitoid) are abundant in the field.

  For cerspora leaf spot copper oxychloride 0.3% should be applied as soon as the disease appear in the crop field. A second spraying at the interval of 7-10 day may be given.

  For web blight (R. solari) carbendazim @ 0.05% should be sprayed on appearance of the disease.

Weed management practice :

1.  The crop should be maintained weed free initially for 4 to 6 weeks following timely interculture and hand weeding.

2.  One hand weeding at 20-25 days after sowing is recommended.

Economic threshold levels (ETL) :

1.  Pod bug 4-5 bugs/10 plants or 2-3 bugs/10 sweeps in the summer green gram crop.

2.  Green stink bug – 6 bugs/10 plants or 3 bugs/10 sweeps in the summer green gram crop.

3.  Aphid 9-16 aphids/plant in the Kharif green gram crop.

  10 aphids/plant in the Kharif green gram crop.

4.  Flea beetle 3.5 adults/10 plants in summer black gram crop.

Pest Monitoring :

1.  Rapid Roving Survey :

  Survey teams should undertake regular inset pest and disease monitoring on preselected routes at 15 days’ interval and assess bio-control potential in addition to insect pest and disease situation to give early forewarning. Record should be kept about insect-pest and disease incidence and bio-potential fauna on 5 plants per spot se- lected randomly at 10 spots per ha. after every 10 km. distance.

Field Scouting :

  Field scouting should be undertaken by the farmers/extension functionaries to keep a close watch on the appearance of insect pest, disease and bio-control fauna.

Agro-eco system analysis (AESA) :

  Based upon weekly AESA, Economic threshold level (ETL) and corresponding change in pest defender ratio, the extension func- tionaries have to take judicious decision in advising farmers for specific pest management practices. Detailed methodology for undertaking AESA exercise is given in Annexure – I.

Pest Monitoring through pheramone/Light trap :

  Certain pests required positioning of various kinds of traps like phero- mone trap, light trap, sticher trap etc. to monitor the pest built-up. There- fore state Department of Agriculture to initiate action for positioning different kinds of traps based upon the results of roving survey at strate- gic locations at village level. While the concept need to be popularized among the farming communities S.B.A. is to take greater initiative for pest monitoring through specific pheromone trapping methods. Instal lpheromone trap at a distance of 50 mtrs. @ 5 trap/ha. Use Heliothis lare and change it after every 20 days. Trapped method should be re- moved daily.

Economic threshold level (ETL)

1.  For H. armigera: 2-3 eggs/5 fruits

  1 larvae/plant at flowering stage (for North Zone of India)

2.  For spotted pod borer: 1 larval/plant (M.testulalis) Or

  1 webbed inflorescence/plant

3.  For Negro bug: 5-6 bugs/plant (M.cribrarium)

Management of Heliothis resistant strains:

  For the last few years, incidence of insecticide resistance in Heliothis have been reported on important crops like cotton and pigeonpea in some parts of the country. Extension functionaries should get in touch with the experts of respective State Agricultural Universities for mapping such areas. Wherever the scientific input is available about occurrence of in- secticide resistance in Heliothis, the areas should be very clearly de- marcated. During the course of surveys’ and also in advising farmers about Heliothis management strategies, utmost care need to be taken “NOT TO ADVOCATE” the pesticide for which resistance has been re- ported in specific areas. Most of the cases of such resistance have been recorded from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu against synthetic pyrethrods.

IPM Strategies :

1.  Cultural practices :

    1.  Summer deep ploughing

    2.  Apply FYM or neem cake

    3.  Select resistant/tolerant variety.

    4.  Cultivation of early maturing variety.

    5.  Synchronise sowing with single variety in a village/area.

    6.  Early planting (June) can be done to avoid peak infestation period of

  H. armigera on short duration pigeonpea.

7.  Planting of tall maize varieties on borders conserves natural enemies and serve as perches for predatory bird.

8.  Provide sitting facilities for birds like black drongo, Blue jay, Mayna (for defoliating pests) through fixing perches.

9.  Trap crop like marigold may be grown in between rows.

10. Rogueing and burning of diseased plants.

 Mechanical practices :

1.  For inset pests like hairy caterpillar, blister beetle, lepidopteran larvae, Apion, Pod bug nymphs etc. Hand picking, jarring on cloth sheets or in bags is effective in a limited way in small areas.

Biological control practices :

1.  Seed treatment with commercial formulation of Trichoderma @ 4gm/kg of seeds.

2.  Predatory spiders like Oxyopes shweta (on M. testulalis larvae and M. cribrarium), predatory bug like Antilohus coqueburti (on M. testulalis larvae), parasitoids like Comopimola sp. & Meloboris sp. (on M. testulalis larvae), Chrysoperla, predatory wasps and birds play significant role in reducing pest population. Indiscrimi- nate use of pesticide should be avoided to conserve them. Instal bird perches for predatory birds.

3.  Spray NPV @ 250 LE/ha or 33 LE/bigha on noticing egg/ 1^(st) instar larva of H armigera (2-3 eggs or 1 larva/5 twigs).

Chemical control :

1.  Against pests infesting floral buds, pod and seeds.

  To control lepidopteran, dipteran, coleopteran and hemipteran pests infesting floral buds, pods and seeds apply malathion 50 EC 0.1% (1 ml/ lit of water) or endosulfan 35 EC 0.07% (2 ml/lit of water) or monocrotophos 40 EC 0.04% (1 ml/lit of water). Spraying should be done @ 500-700 lit/ ha with hand sprayer or 175-250 lit/ha with low volume sprayer.

Disease management :

  Seed treatment with carbendazim and Thiram (1 gm + 2 gm respectively)/kg of seed.

Weed management practices :

  Follow recommended agronomic practice for land prepn., seed rate, recommended fertilizer, irrigation management so as to achieve

  Crop should be maintained weed free initially for 6 to 8 weeks by following timely interculture and hand weeding.

Nematode management practices :

1.  Normally nematodes are not serious problem for pigeonpea. In problem soil avoid summer cropping. Removal of roots of the previously harvested crop from the soil check nematode multiplication.

2.  Crop rotation with millets, sorghum or maize with pigeon peas reduce nematode problem.

3.  Antagonistic crop like marigold, sesame, Mustard may be grown at alternate rows/mixed crop.

Pest Monitoring :

1.  Rapid roving Survey :

  Survey teams should undertake regular insect pest and disease monitoring on pre-selected routes at 15 days interval and assess bio-control potential in addition to inset pest and disease situation to give early forewarnings. Record should be kept about insect pest and disease incidence and bio-potential fauna on 5 plants per spot selected randomly at 10 spot per ha. after every 10 km. distance.

 Field Scouting :

  Field scouting should be undertaken by the farmers/extension functionaries to keep a lose watch on the appearance of insect pest, disease and bio-control fauna.

Agro-eco System Analysis (AESA) :

  Based upon weekly AESA, Economic threshold level (ETL) and corresponding change in pest defender ratio, the extension functionaries have to take judicious decision in advising farmers for specific pest management practices. Detailed methodology for undertaking AESA exercise is given in Annexure-I.

  ★ Timely sowing, proper seed rate (5 kg of seed per ha) Thinning operation should be done to maintain 30 x 15 cm spacing so as to give optimum plant population.

  ★ Keep the crop weed free upto 45 days after sowing by two hand hoeing/weedings at 20 and 35 days.

  ★Intercropping is beneficial with green gram, red gram and pearlmilet.

Mechanical Practices :

i)  Collection and destruction of larvae of hawh moth, leaf webber/ capsule borer and hairy caterpillar.

ii) Use light traps against Lepidopteran pests.

iii) Uproot the phyllody affected plants.

iv) Mechanically remove the roots of previously harvested crops as they harbour cyst nematode.

 Biological Control :

  i) Seed treatment with Trichoderma viride @ 4 gms. per kg. seeds for the control of root rot.

Chemical control :

  i) Insect Pests :

  Spray any of the following insecticide at ETL – Monocrotophos 40 EC @ 1ml./lit. or Dichlovos 100 EC @ 0.5 ml./lit. or Nemazol (5 ml./lit. grater) or 0.5%.

Disease :

1.  Seed treatment with 2 gm thirum+2 gm carbendazim against Phytophthora blight.

2.  When diseases appear spray ancozeb @ 1.5 kg.a.i. 750

  ltrs. of water against Phytophthora blight.

3.  In case bacterial wilt drench streptocycline 200 ppm @ 200 ml. solution/plant.

Weed Management Practices :

1.  Follow all agronomic practice as per recommendation.

2.  One hand weeding and thinning of plant as per recommended spacing at 20 days after sowing.

Safety parameters :

  Annexure II deals with safety parameters interalia classification of toxicity as per Insecticides Rules, 1971, WHO Classification of hazards, colour of toxicity triangle. First aid measures, symptoms of poisoning and treatment of poisoning. The extension functionaries of the State Department of Agriculture have to make use of this information as under.

i)  Basic precautions which are required to be taken as per classification of toxicity as well as hazard criteria by WHO may be seen as per Annexure III.

ii) The extension functionaries are to educate the farmers on safety use of pesticides with the help of colour toxicity triangle as the farming community can follow the colour and corresponding safety precautions.

iii) The symptom of poisoning must be known to the extension functionaries to enable them to extend first aid measures to affected persons to the extent possible.

iv) Basically, the information on first aid measures and treatment of poisoning is required to be passed on by the extension functionaries to the doctors at Primary Health Centres as well as to the Private Doctors in the vicinity of spraying of pesticides.

v)  Extension functionaries must ensure that names of common pesticides during plant protection measures alongwith a copy of the leaflet, which is an integral part of a pesticide container must be made available to the doctors in the vicinity of plant protection operations.

vi) Extension functionaries are to request the doctors to intervene in procurement of antidotes for different pesticides as cited under “Treatment of poisoning”.

II. Pest Monitoring

  The objective of pest monitoring is to detect the initial development of pests and diseases and also the biocontrol potential in the field situations.

Rapid Roving Survey (RPS)

  Survey teams should undertake regular insect pests and disease monitoring on preselected routes at seven days interval and assess biocontrol potential in addition to insect pest and disease situation to give early forewarnings. Records should be kept about insect pests and disease incidence and biocontrol fauna. Aphids population should be recorded on 34 plants (100 leaves) and leaf hoppers population by sweep method and plant count. The fields should be selected randomly after every 10 km. distance. The working index for rodent pests is 25 live burrows per hectare.

Field Scouting

  Field scouting should be undertaken by the farmers/extension functionaries to keep a close watch on the appearance of insect pests, diseases and biocontrol fauna, once in seven days to work out the ETL. For sucking pests population should be counted on three leaves (top, middle and lower) per plant, cut worms and white grub percent damage assessment can be made by counting total number of plants and affected plants.

  When the weather conditions become congenial (overcast sky, high humidity or intermittent rains) the fields should be monitored on alternate days for occurrence of late blight.

Agro Eco System Analysis (AESA)

  Based upon weekly AESA, Economic Threshold level (ETL) and corresponding change in pest defender ratio, the extension functionaries have to take judicious decision in advising farmers for specific pest management practice. The basic components of AESA are :-

1.  Plant health at different stages

2.  Built-in-compensation abilities of the plants.

3.  Pest and defender population dynamics.

4.  Soil conditions

5.  Climatic factors

6.  farmers past experience

  Details methodology for undertaking AESA exercise is given in Annexure-I.

Pest Monitoring Through Pheromones/Yellow Pan/Sticky Traps

1.  Pheromone traps – monitoring.

  The pheromone traps may be placed in the field @ 20 traps per ha.

  For potato tubermoth for mass trapping the field and @ 4 traps per 100 m³ area of the stores.

2.  Yellow pan/sticky traps

  Set up yellow pan/sticky traps for monitoring aphids @ 10 yellow pans/sticky traps per ha. Locally available empty yellow Palmolive tins coated with grease/vaselins/castor oil on outer surface may also be used.

C.  Economic Threshold Level (ETL)

    1.  Aphids 20 aphids/100 leaves

    2.  Potato tubermoth 15-20 moth/trap consecutive for 3 nights

    3.  Late blight not more than 1% leaf area affected

    4.  Bacterial wilt 1% of plant population

    5.  Potato viruses 1% of plant population

    6.  Soil and tuber 5% potato tuber borne diseases

III. Integrated Pest Management

Cultural Practice :

1.  Summer deep ploughing to expose soil inhabiting/resting stages of insects and pathogens.

2.  Trimming of field bunds and flooding to destroy the rodent holes and tunnels.

3.  Plant disease free tubers at optimum date (2nd fortnight of October).

4.  Use resistant/tolerant varieties.

  Tolerant variety for rodent and cut worm : Lalpahari (Local variety Rangpuria)

  Moderately resistant for late blight : Kufri Jyoti Kufri Badshah, Kufri Megha

5.  Apply recommended NPK dose :

6.  Prepare ridges to cover the seed tubers to avoid tuber moth infestation.

7.  Timely irrigation as per recommendation helps in suppressing red ant and cutworm infestation in potato field.

8.  maintain proper field moisture to avoid disease and mole cricket attack.

9.  Follow crop rotation with non solanaceeous crop.

10. Crop should be maintained weed free initially upto six weeks after planting by restoring to hand hoeing/earthing up operation at 3 and 6 weeks after planting.

11. Rogueing of virus infected plants.

Mechanical Practices

1.  Collect and destroy larvae, pupae and adults of cutworms and white grubs.

2.  Sort out late blight infected tubers, cut worm and white grub damaged tubers to avoid secondary infection in the stores.

Biocontrol Practices

1.  Conserve predators like lady bird beetles, predatory wasps, sur- face bugs, spiders and parasitoids like Apanteles, Bracon and telenomus.

Pesticide application

a.  Insect Control

    1.  In areas where red ant/termite infestations are there, application of azadirachtin 1500 ppm @ 3 l/ha proves to be effective. The treatment is to be applied at the time of planting and at earning as soil drenching.

    2.  For other insects spraying of Chlorpyriphos 20EC @ 2ml/lit or Fenitrothion 50EC 500 grams a.i./ha should be done upon attain- ing ETL.

2.  Apply metalaxyl 80% + mancozeb 64% WP combination formu- lation @ 2.5 kg/ha for the control of the late blight after one spray of above fungicides in cases when the disease has established and the weather is congenial for further build up of the disease.

3.  Apply streptomycin 0.02% (200 mg/lit) or spray 100 ppm strep- tomycin for the control of bacterial wilt.

c.  Weed Control

    1.  Application metribuzin @ 0.5 kg/ha or alachlor 2.5 a.i/ha or atra- zine 0.25 kg a.i./ha. or fluchloralin 0.45-0.67 kg a.i./ha as pre- emergence for controlling major weeds.

d.  Rodent Control

    1.  If the rodent infestation is less than 25 live burrows/ha., use bromadiolone 0.005% bait (10-15 gram per burrow inside the live burrows). However if the rodent infestation is high (more than 25 live burrows per ha.), use Zinc Phosphide 2-2.5% baits @ 10 grams per burrow to be placed inside the live burrows after pre-baiting with plain bait. The control operations may be started during first week of June in the hills.

Pest Monitoring

A.  Agro Eco System Analysis

  Agro Ecco System Analysis (AESA) is approach, which can be gain- fully employed by extension functionaries and farmers to analyse field situations with regard to pests, defenders, soil conditions, plant health, the influence of climatic factors and their-relationship for growing healthy crop. Such a critical analysis of the field situations will help in taking appropriate decision on management practices. The basic components of AESA are:

1.  Plants health at different stages

2.  Built-in-compensation abilities of the plants

3.  Pest and defender population dynamics

4.  Soil conditions

5.  Climatic factors

6.  Farmer’s Past experience

Field Scouting

  AESA required skill. So only the training farmers can undertake their exercise. However, other farmers also can do field scouting in their own fields at regular intervals to monitor the major pest situation. Simple field scouting on pest situation by the farmers helps to minimize pesticide usage to a large extent.

Pheromones

  Pheromone traps with lures are commercially available for pests like fruit borer and Tobacco caterpillar. Install 5 traps per hectare with lures for each pests. Traps should be installed in the field in such a way that the position of lure is always 6-12” above the crop canopy. Replace the lures once in 15-25 days depending upon the weather conditions. The trapped moths should be collected and killed daily. ETL for fruit borer is 8 to 10 moths per day per trap.

 Yellow Pan Water trap/Sticky Traps

  Set up yellow pan water trap/sticky traps for monitoring whitefly, thrips etc. @ 10 traps per ha. Locally available empty tins can be painted yellow/coated with grease/Vaseline/castor oil on outer surface may also be used as yellow sticky trap.

  Root knot nematodes cause galls and reniform causes ‘dirty roots’. Their presence can be detected by “Trypan blue” strain which turns nematode eggs sac dark blue whereas, roots stay uncoloured.

Economic Threshold Level (ETL)

  The Economic threshold level (ETL) is an attempt to improve decision making practices by using partial economic analysis on the impact of the control practice such as spraying a pesticide. At the ETL, the benefit of spraying a pesticide. At the ETL, the benefit of spraying is equal to the losses caused by the insects in the field. The farmers are advised to take appropriate control measures when the incidence crosses ETL. The ETL for some of the major pests are listed below:

  Pest Economic Threshold Level

  Tomato fruit borer One egg/one larve/one damaged fruit per

plant

  Whitefly 4 adults/leaf (as a sucking pest)

  Root-knot reniform 1-2 larvae/g soil

  nematode

1.  IPM Strategies for Tomato

Cultural Practices

1.  Crop rotation with frenchbeans reduces the bacterial wilt disease incidence. Crop rotation with cereals, sesame, mustard and marigold to reduce nema tode infestation.

2.  Adopt raised nursery beds (10 cms) for drainage thereby avoid damping off in solanaceous nurseries by preventing soil borne fungi viz., Pythium, Phytotophthora, Rhizoctonia, etc.

3.  Deep summer ploughing helps in exposing resting stages of pests.

4.  Resistant varieties like Punjab NR-7, NR-3, NT-8, NT-12, Hisar N-1, Hasar N-2 and Hisar N-3 may be sown.

5.  Wilt resistant variety VC-48-1 may be grown.

6.  Destruction of crop residues after harvest.

7.  Crop sanitation.

  73

  74

Mechanical Control :

1.  Collection and distribution of egg masses, larvae to Tobbacco cutworm/leaf eating caterpillar and tomato fruit borer.

2.  Regular destruction of damaged fruits at each harvest.

3.  Installation of pheromone traps @ 5 per ha for monitoring H. armigera and S. litura.

4.  Trap Crop technology : Tomato fruit borer is the major pest on developing fruits and is responsible for major yield loss in tomato. The IPM practices for tomato fruit borer includes intercropping a tall variety of marigold as trap crop in a row after every 16 rows of tomato. Raising of marigold nursery should be 15 days prior to tomato nursery, so that 25 and 40 days old tomato and marigold seedlings a replanted. Maximum egg laying is observed on marigold flowers and the movement of larvae from marigold to to- mato is not significant. Eggs and larvae are removed from fields alongwith the flowers. This trap cropping system also helps in re- ducing the root knot nematode infestation.

Biological control :

1.  Conservation

(a) Some parasites are very active in the field against serious pests of vegetable crop eg. Trichogramma sp., Trichogramma toideae armigera, Compoletis Chlorideae, Carceliaillota, Eriborus argenteopilosus, Hyosoter didynator, Palexorista laxa, Goniopthalmus halli on H. armigra, Telenomus remus, chelonus heliopae, C. Formosanus, C. Blackburni Iriborus sp. Cotesia colemani, Cotesia marginiventris, microplitis sp., Charops obtuse, Euplectrus sp., Peribae orbata against S. Litura.

(b) In addition to these parasites, general predators like Coccinellids, Syrphids, Spiders, Carabids, Staphylinids, Dragonfly, damselfly. Predatory miridbugs, predatory pentatomids, Nabid bugs, Reduvid bugs, anthocoridbugs, Geocorid bugs, predatory mite, predatory thrips also actively suppress the pest population. Stethorus apuperculus is active predator on red spidermite.

(c) Need based and judicious application of insecticides are to be applied for conservation of natural enemies.

(d) Grow cowpea or pulses on the border area of main crop to build up natural enemy fauna.

 Augmentation :

1.  Inundative release of Trichogramma brasiliensis. T. Chilonis or

  T. priteosum @ 50,000 per ha. Starting from formation stage for 6 times at weekly interval.

2.  Spray bacillus thurigiensis var Kurstaki, the commercial preparation @ 0.5 kg/ha against lepidopteran pests.

Chemical Control :

1.  Treat nursery bed with 0-3 to 0.6 gms a.i/sq.m of Carbofuran 3 G for nematode management.

2.  Spray 100 ppm St reptocycline sulphate on unriped fruits of tomato to control bacterial spot Xanthomonas compestris pv vesicatoria or dipping seedlings in 100 ppm streptocycline sulphate before transplanting.

3.  Application of calcium chloride (1%) on green fruits to control blossom end rotar application of lime @ 5-10 g/ha in the soil.

4.  Application of carbufuran 1 kg a.i. per ha during early stages of crop to avoid sucking pests and also nematodes.

5.  Spraying of Bacilus thusingunses 1-1.5 lit/ha.

Agro Eco System Analysis (AESA)

  AESA is an approach, which can be gainfully employed by extension functionaries and farmers to analyse field situations with regard to pests, defenders, soil conditions, plant health, the influence of climatic factors and their-relationship for growing healthy crop. Such a critical analysis of the field situations will help in taking appropriate decision on management practices. The basic components of AESA are:

1.  Plants health at different stages

2.  Built-in-compensation abilities of the plants

3.  Pest and defender population dynamics

6.  Farmer’s Past experience

  The details of AESA are given in Annexure -1.

Field Scouting

  AESA required skill and so only the trained farmers can undertake their exercise. However, other farmers also can do field scouting in their own fields at regular intervals to monitor the major pest situation. Simple field scouting on pest situation by the farmers helps to minimize pesticide usage to a large extent.

Pheromones

  Pheromone traps with lures are commercially available for pests like H. armigera, S.litura, Earias sp. Install 5 traps per hectare with lures for each pests, keep the distance of 5 meters between the traps. Traps should be installed in the field in such a way that the position of lure is always 6” to 12” above the crop canopy. Replace the lures once in 15 to 25 days depending upon the weather conditions. The trapped moths should be collected and killed daily. ETL for H. armigera is 8 to 10 moths per day per trap.

Yellow Water Pan /Sticky Traps

  Set up yellow pan/sticky traps for monitoring whitefly, thrips etc. @ 10 traps per ha. Locally available empty tins can be painted yellow/ coated with grease/Vaseline/castor oil on outer surface may also be used as yellow pan trap.

Root knot nematode

  Root knot nematode causes galls and reniform nematode causes “dirty roots”. Their presence can be deducted by using “Trypan Blue” stain, which turms nematode egg sacs dark blue in colour, whereas the roots remain uncoloured.

Economic Threshold Level (ETL)

  The Economic threshold level (ETL) is an attempt to improve decision making practices by using partial economic analysis on the impact of the control practice such as spraying a pesticide. At the ETL, the benefit of spraying is equal to the losses caused by the insects in the field. The farmers are advised to take up the appropriate measures, whenever the incidence crosses ETL. The ETL for some of the major pests are listed below:

+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
|   Insect                        |   ETL                                |

III. IPM strategies for Okra/Bhindi (Ladies finger)

Cultural Practices

1.  Field sanitation and removing alternate hosts helps the crop free from pests.

2.  Crop seed should be sown timely in well prepared field at recommended spacing. Use balanced dose of fertilizer for obtaining optimum plant population and healthy crop stand, which would be capable of completing with weeds at initial stages of crop growth.

3.  Crop rotation with non-host knot and reniform nematodes eg. Wheat, Sorgham. Intercropping with marigold, onion, garlic is also useful.

Mechanical Control

a.  Destruction of infested fruits

b.  Installation of pheromon traps for Earias & Helicoverpa @ 5 per ha.

c.  Yellow pan/sticky traps @ 10 per ha for monitoring white files.

d.  Crops should be maintained weed free for 4-6 weeks after planting by resorting to timely hand hoeing/hand weedings.

Biological Control

1.  Conservation

    1.  Conserve parasites like Erythmelus empoascae, Anagrus empoascae which are active against Amrasca bigutulla; Parasites like Microbracon lefroyi, Rogas testaceus, R. aligarensis, Bracon hebetor, B. greeni and Trichogramma sp. on earias are found active.

    2.  Aphelinus flavipes parasitizes Aphis gossypi and Eurytoma sp. Parasitizes M. Hibisci.

    3.  In addition to these parasites, general predators like coccinellids, syrphids, spiders, carabids, Stophylinids, dragonfly, damselfly, predatory miribugs, predatory pentatomids, nabid bug, reduvild bug, Anthocorid bug, Geocorid bug, predatory mite, predatory thrips also actively suppress the pest population. Since these natural enemies are highly prone for pesticides, avoiding unnecessary sprays is the best way to conserve them.

Augmentation

1.  Release of T.priteosum/T.chilonis @ 50,000 ha against H.armigera

  and Earias sp.

2.  Release Chrysoperla carnea @ 2 grubs per plant 2 times at weekly interval against whitefly and other soft bodied insects.

3.  Spray HINPV 250 LE/ha for 2 times at a weekly interval.

4.  Spray B. Basiana (1 X 10⁴ cfu/g) for whitefly nymph control for 2 times at weekly interval.

Chemical Control

1.  Chemical pesticides should be used on need basis as a last report, only when pest population intensity crossed economic threshold level, the safer pesticides should be applied judiciously.

2.  Apply fluchloralin @ 0.9-1.25 kg a.i./ha as preplanting soil incorporation for weed management.

3.  For fruit and shoot borer and jassids, application of Deltamethrin (Decis 2.8 EC) @0.5ml/lit.

  Or

  Malathion 50EC @ 2ml/lit is useful to manage the pest effectively.

II. Pest Monitoring

A.  Agro Eco System Analysis (AESA)

  AESA is an approach, which can be gainfully employed by extension functionaries and farmers to analyse field situations with regard to pests, defenders, soil conditions, plant health, the influence of climatic factors and their-relationship for growing healthy crop. Such a critical analysis of the field situations will help in taking appropriate decision on management practices. The basic components of AESA are:

1.  Plants health at different stages

2.  Built-in-compensation abilities of the plants

3.  Pest and defender population dynamics

4.  Soil conditions

  The details of AESA are given in Annexure -1.

  All host crops of the locality observed at each spot 20 plants at random. Record population potential of different biocontrol fauna. Record the major disease and their intensity.

Field Scouting

  AESA requires skill and so only the trained farmers can undertake their exercise. However, other farmers also can do field scouting in their own fields at regular intervals to monitor the major pest situation. Simple field scouting on pest situation by the farmers helps to minimize pesticide usage to a large extent.

Pheromones

  Pheromone traps with lures are commercially available for pests like Podborer, Tobacco caterpillar. Install five traps with lures for each pests, keep the distance of 5 meters between the traps. Traps should be installed in the field in such a way that the position of lure is always 6” to 12” above the crop canopy. Replace the lures once in 15 to 25 days depending upon the weather conditions. The trapped moths should be collected and killed daily. ETL for Podborer is 8 to 10 moths per day per trap.

Yellow Water Pan /Sticky Traps

  Set up yellow pan/sticky traps for monitoring whitefly, thrips etc. @ 10 traps per hectare. Locally available empty yellow Palmolive tins coated with grease/Vaseline/castor oil on outer surface may also be used as yellow pan trap.

Root Knot Nematode

  Root knot causes diagonistic symptoms of galls formation and reniform causes dirty roots. Their presence can be detected by using “Trypan Blue”/cotton blue stain, solution in water, which turms nematode egg sacs dark blue in colour, whereas the roots stay uncoloured. The cyst nematode adult female cause “Pearly root disease” at 30 to 45 days crop stage. Examine roots held upside down with handlens.

E. Economic Threshold Levels (ETL)

  The Economic threshold level (ETL) is an attempt to improve decision making practices by using partial economic analysis on the impact of the control practices such as spraying a pesticide. At the

  ETL, the benefit of spraying is equal to the losses caused by the insects in field. The farmers are advised to take up the appropriate measures, whenever the incidence crosses ETL. The ETL for some of the major pests are listed below:

+----------------------+----------------+------------------------------+
|   Pest               |   Crops        |   Economic Threshold Level   |
+======================+================+==============================+

  Pod borers One egg or one larva per plant or one damaged fruit per plant.

  Leaf hopper 2.5 Leaf hoppers/leaf

  Root knot nematode 1-2 juveniles/g of soil

III. IPM Strategies for Legumes

  III. 1-A Cultural Practices :

1.  Deep summer ploughing to expose resting stages of pests and soil borne nematodes. This practice should be done thrice at an interval of 15 days in nematode infested areas.

2.  Early sowing of the crops to avoid peak infestation of pests.

3.  Timely and optimum irrigation to contain major foliar diseases.

4.  Crop rotation with cereals; rice/maiza against pod borers of beans, it also helps in reducing Epilachna beetles and thrips. Nematode populations also reduce by this rotation. Marigold may be used as an intercrop.

5.  Use higher seed rate in bean stem fly in endemic areas.

6.  Application of 200 kg neem cake per ha helps in controlling root rot diseases, nematodes, bean stem fly, etc.

7.  Mixed and multiple cropping to reduce bean shoot borer and other pests. Marigold should be incorporated to reduce nematodes.

8.  Crop seedling should be planed timely in well prepared fields at recommended spacing. Use balanced doses of fertilizers to obtain optimum plant population and healthy crop stand, which would be capable of competing with weeds at initial stages of crop growth.

9.  Removal of any previous crop residues is very essential to prevent population build up of soil borne rematodes.

10. Thick layer of dry organic mulch on soil surface to suppress the weeds.

11. Stale seed bed technique to kill the first flush of weeds before sowing.

12. Use of well decomposed organic manure.

13. Destruction of weeds before their seed setting.

B.  Mechanical Control

    1.  Rouguing of affected plants particularly virus infested plants.

    2.  Hand collection and destruction of egg mass larvae and infected leaves.

    3.  Installation of pheromone traps @ 5/ha for monitoring of lepidopteran pests.

    4.  Crop should be maintained weed free for 4 to 6 weeks after planting by reporing to timely hand hoeing/hand weedings. In case of row planted crop, use of dryland weeder is cost effective.

    A.  Biological Control :

Conservation :

a)  Some parasites are very active in the field against serious pests of leguminous crop. Eg. Trichogramma sp. Trichogrammatoidea armigera. Compoletis chloridae, Carcelia illota, Eriborus orgenteopilosus, Hyposter didynotor, Palexorista laxa, Gonoipthalmus halli on H. Armigera; Telenomus remus, Chelonus heliopae, C. Formosanus, C. Blackburni, Eriborus sp., Cotesia colemani, Cotesia marginiventris, Microplitis sp., Charope obtuse, Euplectrus sp., Peribaea orbata against S. Litura; Goniozus, sp. Cotesia sp., Bracon habetor, Cedria paradoxa Brocon greeni, Telenomus sp., Phaneraotoma sp. are found active against Maruca sp., Chrysonofomyia appannai, Chrysocharis johnsoni, Elasmus sp. Pediobius foveolatus, Tetrastichus ovulorum against Epilachna sp.; conserve Hemitarsenus varicornis, Gonotoma hrysonotomyia sp., on serpentine leaf miner, Aphidius sp., Aphelinus sp., on aphids; Stethorus pauperculus is active parasite on red spider mite.

b)  In addition to these parasites, general predators like Coccinellids, Syrphids, Spiders, Carabids, Stophylinids, Dragonfly, Damselfly predatory mirid bugs, predatory pentatomids nabid bug, reduvid bug. Anthocorid bug, Geocorid bug, predatory mite, predatory thrips also actively suppress the pest population.

c)  Nematodes like Hexamermis sp. Entomopathogenic fungi like Nemuria releyi, Metarhizium anisipoliae, Heterorhabditis and Steinernema are active during rainy season against lepidopteran pests.

  91

  92

d)  Erect bird perches @ 50/ha to attract local predatory birds, which in turn feed on insect pests.

1.2 Augmentation

a)  Seed treatment with Trichoderma viride @ 2 g per 100 g seed to contain soil borne fungal infection.

b)  Release T.chilonis @ of 50,000/ha at per flowering and to be continued for 5 times at an interval of 7 days.

    A.  Chemical Control

        1.  Chemical pesticide should be used on need basis as a last resort. Only when pest population intensity crossed economic threshold level, the safer pesticides should be applied judiciously.

        2.  Spray 5 percent NSKE 30 days after sowing and same should be repeared for 2 times once in 10 days.

        3.  Soil application of carbofuran granulea at 30 kg/ha may be followed before sowing of summer crops for pretection against thrips and flea beetle and for kharif crop, for protection against stem fly and jassi. It also reduces the incidence of YMV disease and nema- todes.

        4.  Spray wettalble sulhur @ 12.5 kg/750 to 1000 lt. Water/ha to sontrol powdery mildew.

        5.  Fluchloralin (Basalin 45EC) @ 1.5 kg a.i/ha as pre-planting incorporation for weed control. Alachlor 10 G @ 2.5 kg/ha as pre emergence herbicide is recommended for weed management.

        6.  Seed treatment with carbosufan 25 ST @ 3 per cent (W/W) reduces nema tode population on soil.

        7.  Application of dichlorvos (Nuvan 100EC) @ 0.5 ml/1 should be applied against pod borer, podbugs and leaf miner. Against pea aphid and cowpea aphid, apply malathion 50 EC @ 2 ml/1

  II. Pest Monitoring

A.  Agro Eco System Analysis (AESA)

  AESA is an approach, which can be gainfully employed by extension functionaries and farmers to analyse field situations with regard to pests, defenders, soil conditions, plant health, the influence of climatic factors and their inter-relationship for growing healthy crop. Such a critical analysis of the field situations will help in taking appropriate decision on management practices. The basic components of AESA are:

1.  Plants health at different stages.

2.  Built-in-compensation abilities of the plants.

3.  Pest and defender population dynamics.

4.  Soil conditions.

5.  Farmer’s Past experience.

The details of AESA are given in Annexure -1.

B.  Field Scouting

  AESA required skill. So only the trained farmers can undertake their exercise. However, other farmers also can do field scouting in their own fields at regular intervals to monitor the major pest situation. Simple field scouting on pest situation by the farmers helps to minimize pesticide usage to a large extent.

C.  Yellow Water Pan /Sticky Traps

  Set up yellow pan/sticky traps for monitoring whitefly, thrips etc. @ 10 traps per ha. Locally available empty yellow Palmolive tins coated with grease/Vaseline/castor oil on outer surface may also be used as yellow pan trap.

D.  Nematodes

  Root knot nematodes cause gall formation and reniform nematodes cause “dirty root”. Their presence can be detected by using “Trypan Blue” stain solutions in water which turns nematodes egg sac dark blue in colour whereas roots remain uncoloured.

Economic Threshold Level (ETL)

  The Economic Threshold Level (ETL) is an attempt to improve decision making practices by using partial economic analysis on the impact of the control practice such as spraying a pesticide. At the ETL, the benefit of spraying is equal to the losses caused by the insects in the field. The farmers are advised to take appropriate measures when the incidence crosses ETL. The ETL for some of the major pests are listed below –

  Nematodes 1-2 juveniles/g of soil

  IPM STRATEGIES FOR CUCURBIT VEGETABLES

Cultural Practices :

1.  Deep ploughing during summer to expose the nematodes to solar radiation and also the resting stages of the pests.

2.  Crop rotation with paddy in low-lying areas is very effective, against downy and powdery mildew.

3.  Preventing the crops from overlapping and adequate spacing to minimize the length of leaf wetness period, for downy mildew disease management.

4.  Crop seedling should be planted timely in well prepared fields at recommended spacing. Use balanced dose of fertilizer for obtaining plant population and healthy crop stand, which would be capable of competing with weeds in initial stages of crop growth.

5.  Application of thick dry organic mulch helps to suppress weeds.

6.  Ranking to the vine yard around the plant to expose the pupae of fruitfly.

  97

  98

Mechanical Control :

1.  Growing a few scattered cucurbit plant in January and destroying the attacted beetle by hand collection is useful.

2.  Eradication of disease infected plants.

3.  Removal of alternate hosts from the field particularly for virus disease management.

4.  Destruction of wild cucurbit plant and crop residues reduces the incidence of root knot nematode and anthracnose and powdery mildew respectively.

5.  Remove damaged fruit and burn.

6.  Careful cultivation and harvesting avoiding wounds, helps in reducing infection particularly to gummy stern blight disease.

7.  Hand collection of adult beetle from plants.

8.  Vinegar + sugar syrup in a pumpkin as baiting to chnique helps in controlling fruit fly.

9.  Covering of fruit with strew or cloth bag to prevent fruit fly attack.

10. Uprooting of climbing/twining weeds.

Biological Control :

1.  Conservation

a)  Conserve national enemies such as Opius Compensatus, O.Incisus Spalangia philippinensis, O.Composans which are very active parasite against fruit fly in the field by regular monitoring.

b)  In addition to these parasites, general predators like coccinellids, Syrphids, Spiders, Carabids, Stophylinids, Dragonfly, Damselfly predatory miridbugs, predatory Pentatomids, Nabid bugs, Reduvid bugs, Anthocorid bug, Geocorid bugs, predatory mites, preda- tory thrips also actively suppress the pest population.

c)  Since these natural enemies are highly prone for pesticides, avoiding unnecessary sprays are the best way to conserve them.

d)  Erect bird perchers @ 50/ha to attact birds, which in turn feeds on pest.

    1.  Augmentation

        a)  Seed treatment with T.Viride 2 g per 100 g of seed

        b)  Application of T.Viride @ 50 gm in 10 kg. FYM during early stages of the crops along the rows, which helps in inhibiting soil borne fungus infection.

Chemical Control :

1.  Chemical pesticide should be used on need basis as a last resort. Only when pest population intensity crossed economic threshold level, the safer pesticides should be applied judiciously.

2.  Application of 2 kg a.i. carbofuran/ha before sowing helps in con- trolling pests of early stages and root knot nematode population in soil.

3.  Spraying of Chloropyriphos 100 g a.i./ha to kill adult pumpkin beetle when they are found on foliage.

4.  Spray five per sent NSKE during early stage of the crop once and later at 15 days interval will effectively control sucking pests.

5.  Foliar spray with thiophanate, methyl 1000 g a.i/ha or mancozeb or zineb 1.125 to 1.5 kg a.i./750 lt. of water/ha. Helps in control- ling the anthracnose disease.

6.  Spraying with dinocap 100ml/750 lt. of water/ha gives good con- trol over powdery mildew.

7.  In direct seeded crops, treatment of seed with carbosulfan (25ST) @ 3% (W/W) reduces the root knot nematode problem.

8.  Spray malathion 50EC @ 2ml/1 mixed with 1% molasses to con- trol fruit fly adults. Spraying should in the evening time on the crop as well as to the vicinity of the crop on vegetations.

PEST MONITORING

A.  Agro Eco-System Analysis (AESA)

  AESA is an approach, which can be gainfully employed by extension functionaries and farmers to analyse field situations with regard to pests, defenders, soil conditions, plant health, the influence of cli- matic factors and their-relationship for growing healthy crop. Such a critical analysis of the field situations will help in taking appropriate

  decision on management practices. The basic components of AESA are:

  104

1.  Plants health at different stages.

2.  Built-in-compensation abilities of the plants.

3.  Pest and defender population dynamics.

4.  Soil conditions.

5.  Climatic factors.

6.  Farmer’s Past experience.

  The details of AESA are given in Annexure -1.

Field Scouting

  AESA required skill. So only the trained farmers can undertake their exercise. However, other farmers also can do field scouting in their own fields at regular intervals to monitor the major pest situation. Simple field scouting on pest situation by the farmers helps to minimize pesticide usage to a large extent.

Pheromones

  Pheromone traps with lures are commercially available for pests like H. armigera, S.litura. Install five traps with lures for each pests; keep the distance of meters between the traps. Traps should be installed in the field in such a way that the position of lure is always 6 - 12 above the crop canopy. Replace the lures once in 15 - 25 days depending upon the weather conditions. The trapped moths should be collected and killed daily. ETL for H. armigera is 8 to 10 moths per day per trap.

Yellow Water Pan /Sticky Traps

  Set up yellow pan/sticky traps for monitoring whitefly, thrips etc. @ 10 traps per ha. Locally available empty yellow Palmolive tins coated with grease/Vaseline/caster oil on outer surface may also be used as yellow pan trap.

Nematode

  Root knot nematodes cause gall formation and reniform nematodes cause “dirty root” symptom. Their presence can be detected by using “Trypan Blue” stain in water which turns nematodes egg sac dark in colour whereas roots remain uncoloured.

E. Economic Threshold Level (ETL)

  The economic threshold level (ETL) is an attempt to improve de- cision making practices by using partial economic analysis on the impact of the control practice such as spraying a pesticide. At the ETL, the benefit of spraying is equal to the losses caused by the insects in the field. The farmers are advised to take appropriate

  measures when the incidence crosses ETL. The ETL for some of the major pests are listed below –

  Leaf webber 1 Larva per meter row of length

  Nematodes 1-2 Juveniles per gm of soil

  Spider mite 2 mites per leaf

  Saw fly radish 1 larva per plant Diamond backmoth 1 larva per plant.

IPM STRATEGIES FOR CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES

A.  Cultural Practices

    1.  Deep ploughing during summer to expose resting population of insects, nematodes and disease causing organisms.

    2.  Follow crop rotation.

    3.  Select resistant and tolerant varities.

    4.  Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest.

    5.  Crop seedlings should be timely planted in well prepared field at recommended spacing and balanced dose of ferilizer.

    6.  Solarization of nursery bed by covering it with polythene transparent sheet (60-100 gauge) for 15-21 days is recommended to avoid nematode problem.

    7.  Well rotten cowdung or compost should be applied to reduce weed population.

    8.  Destroy weeds before their seed setting.

    9.  Stale seed bed technique to kill first flush of weeds before sowing of crop.

    10. Remove and destroy weeds from vicinity of crop field to check diseases.

    11. In club root infected fields, do not grow cruciferous crop for 8

  years.

12. Apply borax @ 5-10 kg/ha for reducing black rot.

13. Grow non-cruciferous crops for two years for reducing black rot.

14. To prevent club root, incidence, add lime to the soil to raise the PH to 7.0

15. Sanitary measures are to be adopted against diseases.

  105

  106

Mechanical Control

1.  Hand collection of life Stages of insect pests reduces the infectation.

2.  Collection and destruction of infected old leave of cole crops regularly.

3.  Roguing of borer affected cabbage/cauliflower plants.

4.  Crop should be maintained weed free for 4-6 weeks after planting by resorting to timely hand hoeing/hand weedlings.

5.  Flodding to kill the crickets in burrows.

Trap Crop Technology

  Two rows are to be sown with mustard as trap crop at the beginning and after every 25 cabbage rows. Bold seeded mustard is more suited. Mustard is to be sown twice; first is at 15 days prior to cabbage transplating, while the second one is at 25 days after cabbage planting. Thick sowing of mustard i.e. 50-60 plants per meter row is recommended. Usually, the inter-cropped cabbage is free from infection during early stages. However, there may be some incidence at later stages. For this, apply either 5% NSKE or Cartaphydrochloride 2 gm. per liter of water.

Bio-logical Control

1.  Avoiding spraying of broad spectrum pesticides to conserve the natural enemies.

2.  Erect bird percher @ 50 nos. per ha. helps the birds to come and eat the insect larvae.

3.  Distribute small quantity of cooked rice at different places in the field which attracts birds like yellow wage tile, gray wage tile, common swallows and Indian myna.

4.  Seed treatment with Trichodema viridie @ 2 gm.per 100 100 gm. of seed.

5.  Release Trichogramma toidea bactrea or T. chilonis or T. pretiosum egg parasites @ 50,000 per ha., 4-5 times with interval of 5-7 days helps in controlling DBM and other lepodopteran pests.

6.  Make inoculative release of Cotesia plutellae @ 5,000 per ha. on 10-15 days after planting to control DBM.

7.  Spray commercial preparation of Bacillus thuringiensis Var. kurstaki @ 500 gm. per ha. after 15 days planting and should be repeated after every 15 days to control DBM and other lepidopteran pests.

8.  Spray Beauvaria bassiana (1 x 10⁶ cfu/g) @ 2 gm per litre of water after every 20 days to control lepidopteran pests.

9.  Spray Entomophthora sp. (2 x 107 cfu/g) @ 2 gm per litre of water after every 20 days to control lepidopteran pests.

10. Apply twice at 15 days interval of 5% NSKE beginning from head initiation stage.

Botanical pesticides

1.  Apply twice at 15 days interval of 5% NSKE begining from head initiation stage. This treatment would be more effective in cole crop mustad intercrop field.

2.  Lemon juice 1% as a foliar spray for controlling DBM is also found to be effective.

Chemical Control

1.  Chemical pesticides should be applied on need basis as a last resort. Only when pest population intensity crosses ETL, the safer pesticides like malathion 50 EC @ 1.5 ml per litre of water should be applied.

2.  Treat seeds in 100 ppm streptocycline solution for 30 minutes for managing black rot.

3.  Treat seeds with 2 gm. carbendazim per kg. of seed for the control of seed and soil borne fungal pathogens.

4.  Apply mancozeb 75% WP @ 1500-2000 gm per ha. for black rot disease management whenever disease inoculum and climatic con- ditions are noticed.

5.  Treat the nursery bed with cabofuran 3 g. @ 0.3 to 0.6 g.a.i. per sq. meter.

6.  Apply 3 sprays of Cu-oxychloride (3 gm. per litre) at 14 days intervals for black rot disease management, whenever disease ini- tiation is observed and climatic condition favours.

Nematode

  Root Knot nematode

Weeds

  Chick weed (Stellaria media) Ageratum (Ageratum harstonianum) Nut sedge (Cyperus rotundus)

  Crab grass (Digitaria setigera) Cuphea (Cuphea balsamona) Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon)

Pest Monitoring

1.  Agro-Eco System Analysis

  AESA is an approach, which can be gainfully employed by extension functionaries and farmers to analyse field situations with regard to pests, defenders, soil conditions, plant health, the influence of climatic factors and their-relationship for growing healthy crop. Such a critical analysis of the field situations will help in taking appropriate decision on management practices. The basic components of AESA are:

1.  Plants health at different stages.

2.  Built-in-compensation abilities of the plants.

3.  Pest and defender population dynamics.

4.  Soil conditions.

5.  Climatic factors.

6.  Farmer’s Past experience. The details of AESA are given in

Field Scouting

  AESA required skill and so only the trained farmers can undertake their exercise. However, other farmers also can do field scouting in their own fields at regular intervals to monitor the major pest situation. Simple field scouting on pest situation by the farmers helps to minimize pesticide usage to a large extent.

Pheromones

  Pheromone traps with lures are commercially available for pests like H. armigera, S.litura. Install five traps with lures for each pests; keep the distance of meters between the traps. Traps should be installed in the field in such a way that the position of lure is always 6 – 12” above the crop canopy. Replace the lures once in 15 to 25 days depending upon the weather conditions. The trapped moths should be collected and killed daily. ETL for H. armigera is 8 to 10 moths per day per trap.

 Yellow Water Pan /Sticky Traps

  Set up yellow pan/sticky traps for monitoring whitefly, thrips etc. @ 10 traps per ha. Locally available empty yellow Palmolive tins coated with grease/Vaseline/castor oil on outer surface may also be used as yellow pan trap.

Nematode

  Root knot causes diagnostic symptoms of gall formation and reniform nematodes causes “dirty root” symptom. Their presence can be detected by using “Trypan Blue Stain” solution in water which turns nematodes egg sacs dark blue in colour whereas roots remain uncoloured.

Economic Threshold Level (ETL)

  The Economic Threshold Level (ETL) is an attempt to improve decision making practices by using partial economic analysis on the impact of the control practice such as spraying a pesticide. At the ETL be benefit of spraying is equal to the losses caused by the insects in the field. The farmers are advised to take appropriate measures, whenever the incidence crosses ETL. The ETL for some of the major pests are listed below :

  Thrips 6 thrips per leaf or 10% affected plants

  Leaf hopper 2.5 nymphs per leaf

  Fruit borer One egg or one larvae per plant or one

  damaged fruit per plant.

  Root knot nematode 1-2 junveiles/g of soil

IPM Stragies for Solanaceous crops

1.  Cultural Practices

    1.  Phytosanitation to reduce sources of inoculum such as removal of plants after final harvest volunteer plants. Clean plant- ing material, preferably certified seeds should be used.

    2.  Crop rotation with French beans or dhainsa reduces the bacterial wilt disease incidence. Crop rotation with cereals and inter-cropping with marigold onion and garlic reduces nematodes.

    3.  Adopt raised nursery bed (10 cms) for good dra inage, thereby avoid damping off in solanaceous nurseries by preventing soil borne fungi viz., Pythium, Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia, etc.

  112

4.  Soil solarization using transparent polythene sheets 60-100 gauge thick on nursery beds for about 15 to 21 days which helps in killing weed seeds, nematodes and resting stages of insects and diseases.

5.  Deep summer ploughing to expose resting stages of pests and soil borne nematodes and diseases, weed seeds and retative propagules of weeds to sun light.

6.  Destruction of crop residuces/debris and alternate host ma- terial reduces the inoculum load of any foliar diseases and nema- tode.

7.  Crop seedling should be timely planted in well prepared seed bed at recommended spacing. Use balanced dose of fertilizer to get optimum plant population and healthy crop stand, which would be capable of competing with weeds at the initial stages of crop growth.

8.  Stale seed bed technique to kill the first flush of weeds before planting of the crop.

9.  Use well rotten cowdung or compost to reduce weed population.

10. Remove weeds before their seed setting.

Mechnical Control

1.  Collection and destruction of egg masses, larvae, grubs and adults of Epilachna beetle, tobacco cutworm, etc.

2.  Removal of damaged shoots and fruits and destruction.

3.  Use of yellow pan/sticky traps for sucking pests @ 10 per ha.

4.  Installation of Pheromone traps @ 5 per ha. for monitoring H. armigera and S.litura.

5.  Crops should be maintained weed free for 4-6 weeks after planting be resorting to timely hand hoeing and hand weedings.

Biological Control

  III.3.1

(a) Some practices are very active in the field against serious pests of vegetable crop as required. E.G., Aphidius sp., Aphelinus sp., on aphids; Eurytoma sp.

(b) In addition to these parasites, general predators like coccinelids, syrphids, Spiders, Carabids, Stophylinids, Dragonfly, Damselfly, predatory miridbugs.

(c) Since these natural enemies are highly prone for pesticides, avoiding unnecessary sprays are the best way to conserve them.

(d) Grow cowpea or pulses on the bunds to build up natural enemy fauna.

(e) Install bird percher @ 50 per ha.

Augmentation

(a) Spray of HaNPV @ 250 LE (6x10⁹ PIB per LE) for these times starting from flower initiation to fruit development stage in chillies/ capsicum.

(b) Spray Bacillus thuringgiensis var kurstaki, the commercial preparation @ 500 g per ha. against lepidopteran pests.

(c) Seed treatment with Trichoderma viride/T. Harziamum @ 2 gm per 100 gm of seeds to prevent seed and soil borne infection of fungal diseases.

Botanical Pesticides

(a) Five percent NSKE spray for sucking pests in early stages of the crop, which also takes care of serpentine leaf miner, etc.

(b) Application of neem cake @ 200 kg. per ha. as a basal dose at the time of land preparation for contolling root-knot nema tode infection.

Chemical Control

(a) Chemical pesticide should be used on need basis as a last resort. Only when pest population intensity crossed economic threshold level, the safer pesticides should be a applied judiciously.

(b) Seed treatment with Carbendazim @ 2 g/100 g seed to contain seed borne infection.

(c) Foliar spray of mancozeb 1.125-1.5 kg a.i./ha to control early leaf spot and anthracnose/fruit rot whenever the diseases are noticed.

(d) Application of bleaching powder @ 15 kg/ha before planting against bacterial wilt infection in chillies in endemic areas.

(e) Application of carbofuran 1 kg a.i. per ha. During early stages of crop to avoid sucking pests and also nematodes.

(f) Spray endosulfan 525 g a.i./ha Quinalpos 25 EC 1000 ml/ha, to control insect pests. Alternate spray of Endosulan @ 525 g a.i./ha and Cypermethrin 50 g a.i./ha at 15 days interval.

  113

  114

(g) Treat nursery beds with Carbofuran 3f g @ 0.3 to 0.6 gm a.i./sq.m. In direct seeded crops treat the seed with Carbofuran/Carbosulfan (25 ST) @ 3% (W/W) to reduce root-knot nematode problem.

  AESA is an approach, which can be gainfully employed by extension functionaries and farmers to analyse field situations with regard to pests, defenders, soil conditions, plant health, the influence of climatic factors and their interrelationship for growing healthy crop. Such a critical analysis of the field situations will help in taking appropriate decision on management practices. The basic components of AESA are:

1.  Plants health at different stages.

2.  Built-in-compensation abilities of the plants.

3.  Pest and defender population dynamics.

4.  Soil conditions.

1.  Climatic factors.

2.  Farmer’s Past experience

The details of AESA are given in

Field Scouting

  AESA required skill and so only the trained farmers can undertake their exercise. However, other farmers also can do field scouting in their own fields at regular intervals to monitor the major pest situation. Simple field scouting on pest situation by the farmers helps to minimize pesticide usage to a large extent.

Yellow Water Pan /Sticky Traps

  Set up yellow pan/sticky traps for monitoring whitefly, thrips etc. @ 10 traps per ha. Locally available empty yellow palmolive tins coated with grease/vaseline/castor oil on outer surface may also be used as yellow pan trap.

Economic Threshold Level (ETLs)

  The Economic Threshold Level (ETL) is an attempt to improve decision making practices by using partial economic analysis on the impact of the control practice such as spraying a pesticide. At the ETL the benefit of spraying is equal to the losses caused by the insects in the field. The farmers are advised to take appropriate measures, whenever the incidence crosses ETL. The ETL for some of the major pests are listed below :

  Onion maggot – 1 maggot/hill

III. Integrated Pest Management Strategies

Cultural Practices

1.  Crop rotation with coarse cereals reduces the blotch incidence.

2.  Application of neem cake @ 200kg per ha., against nematodes and soil borne fungus.

3.  Crop seedling should be timely planted in well prepared field at recommended spacing by using balanced dose of fertilizers for obtaining optimum plant population and healthy crop stands which would be capable of competing with the initial stages of the crop growth.

4.  Stale seed bed technique to kill the first flush of weeds before planting of the crop.

5.  Destruction of weeds before their seed setting.

6.  Use of well rotten cowdung manure or compost to reduce weed population.

Mechanical Control

1.  Jet sprinkling of water through jet nozzles to prevent thrips multiplication.

2.  Crop should be maintained weed free for 4-6 weeks after planting by resorting timely hand hoeing/hand weeding.

Biological Control

1.  Conservation

  General predators like Coccinellids, Syrphids, Spiders, Dragonfly, Damselfly, predatory bugs are actively suppress the onion pests. Avoiding unnecessary broadspectrum chemical sprays is the best way to protect them.

Augumentation

a)  Seed treatment with Trichoderma Viride @ 2 g/100 g of seed.

b)  Conservation of predatory bugs.

Chemical Control

1.  Chemical pesticide should be used on need basis as a last resort. Only when pest population intensity crossed economic threshold level, the safer pesticides should be applied judiciously.

2.  Spray 0.5% NSKE during vegetative stage

3.  Spray malathion 50EC @ 2ml/1 to control thrips.

4.  Spray Mancozeb 1.125 to 1.5 kg a.i./ha. for onion blotch/leaf blight.

5.  Against weeds, spray fluchloralin @ 670g-980 g a.i./ha as preplanting soil incorporation or pendimethalin @ 750 g-1000 g a.i./ha as preemergence.

AGRO-ECOSYSTEM ANALYSIS IN VEGETABLES

  IPM is based on ecological interactions between the environment, plants, herbivores and their natural enemies. The maximum yield of the crop is determined by plants and their health. The health of the plant is determined by the environment and the herbivores. The herbivores are balanced by their natural enemies.

  Agroecosystem analysis (AESA) is an approach, which can be gainfully employed by group of farmers for decision making in IPM. The basic components of AESA are :

a.  Plant health at different stages.

b.  Compensation abilities of the plants.

c.  Pest and defender population.

d.  Soil conditions, irrigation status etc.

e.  Weather conditions.

f.  Pest experience of the farmer in the situation.

g.  Other investment opportunities.

  The goal of the AESA activity is to analyse the field situation by observation, drawing and discussion. At the end of the activity the group should have made a decision about any action required for the field. The eco-system analysis is done weekly.

  Time required = 120 minutes.

  Materials required – one note book, two large size paper, pencils and drawing crayons, polythene bags, plastic vials, rubber band and chloroform.

Procedure

  Go to the field, leave the border side, select fifth plant in a row for observation. Move 1-2 rows and select the fifth plant from that position for second observation. Likewise select a total of ten plants. Observe each plant with the following parameters and record.

  Insect-pest, disease and defenders count : Count the large pests and beneficial found on different branches and leaves of the plant. Start from the top of the plant and work downwards. Count the egg masses, larvae and adults of defoliators and workout defoliation percentage. Count the flower and fruit feeding insects and assess the percentage of fruits af- fected by them. Count the branches that are affected by die-back or other shoot diseases.

  Select three leaves from the sample plant, one taken from the top, one from the middle and one from the bottom of the plant. Pick or turn the leaf and count the number of sucking pests and predatory mites. Also record different leaf spot disease symptoms and count the number of spots. Estimate the percentage of leaf area affected.

  Out of ten sample plants assess the number of plants with virus symptoms. Likewise, for wilting symptoms. Pull wilting plants and observe symptoms on the roots (cut the root observe the colour of the vascular tissue).

  Out of ten sample plants, note the number of plants with flowers/fruits to assess the percentage of plants flowering/fruiting.

  Plant parameters : Measure the height of the plant, number of leaves, width of foliage etc.

  Walk through the whole plot the assess any other beneficial, pests or diseases, not observed on the ten sample plants, is occurring, note the uniformity in growth of the plants. Make records of the soil condition, water situation and presence of weeds (observe the different kind of weeds and severity).

  Rate : Count number of plants affected by rat, also record number of live burrows in the plot.

  Weather : Record last week’s weather situation.

  Find a shady place to sit as a group. Each group should sit together in a circle with pencils, crayons, data from each of the field activities and the drawing of the AESA of the previous week.

  Make a drawing on the large piece of paper for each plot observed.

  The rules of drawing are as follows :

  Draw the plant with the correct number of branches, leaves, flowers, fruits; write the plant height and number of green and yellow leaves some where. If the plant is healthy, colour the plant green. If disease occur, draw the disease. If the plant is yellow, colour it yellow. Draw dead or dying leaves in yellow. For weeds draw the approximate density and size of weeds in relation to the size of the vegetable plant. Draw the kinds of weed in the field.

  For pest populations draw the different insects found in the field on the right side of the plant, write the average number next to the insect. Also write the local name next to the insect. The date can also be summarized in a table on the right side.

  121

  122

  For natural enemy populations, draw the insects and spiders as found in the field on the left side of the plant. Write the average number of natural enemies and their local names next to the drawing.

  For rats write the average number of fruits/head attacked.

  If the week was mostly sunny draw a sun. if the week was mostly sunny and cloudy together, draw a sun but half covered with dark clouds. If the week was cloudy all the day for most of the week, put just dark clouds.

  If the fertilizer was applied, then draw a picture of a hand throwing N, P or K depending on the type of fertilizer used.

  If pesticides were used in the field, show sprays with a nozzle and right the type of chemical coming out of the nozzle. If granules were broadcast, show a hand with the name of pesticide being broadcast.

  Now discuss the field situation among the group and arrive at a con- clusion for the management practices required for the field. The discus-

 2. PIT FALL TRAP

  Due to nocturnal behaviour and hiding during day time many insect pests like greasy cutworm, Agrotis ypsilon can’t be observed on plant in the vegetable fields during day time. Like wise many groung dwelling predators like ground beetles which play major role in regular the population of lepidopterous pest like Helicoverpa armigera, Spodopetra litura cannot be assessed properly by visual observations.

  The pit fall trap method is effective in these situations. Pit fall trap is a simple plastic container (1 liter capacity) with lid. Container with half filled water with a few drops of teepol on water surface is buried in the field in such a way that the top surface is at level with that of soil surface. Obser- vation should be made 48 to 72 hours after fixing the trap. Ten traps may be required per hectare of vegetable crop.

  Do’s

1.  Deep ploughing is to be done on bright sunny days during the months of May and June. The field should be kept exposed to sun light at least for 2-3 weeks.

2.  Grow only recommended varieties.

3.  Sow early in the season.

4.  Always treat the seeds with approved chemicals/bio products for the control of seed borne diseases/pests.

5.  Sow in rows at optimum depths under proper moisture conditions for better establishment.

6.  Pre-emergency herbicides should be applied immediately after sowing before the emergence of weeds and crop.

Don’t

  Do not plank or irrigate the field after ploughing, at least for 2-3 weeks, to allow desiccation of weed’s bulbs and/or rhizomes of perennial weeds.

  Do not grow varieties not suitable for the season or the region.

  Avoid late sowing as this may lead to reduced yields and incidence of white grubs and diseases.

  Do not use seeds without seed treatment with biocides/chemicals.

  Do not sow seeds beyond 5-7 cm depth.

  Pre-emergency herbicides should not be applied after emergence of crop and/or weeds, as they cannot control the germinated weeds as well as they may cause phytotoxicity to the crop.

  124

  Do’s

7.  Herbicides like fluchloralin should be incorporated into the soil immediately after spraying to avoid its photo degradation.

8.  Apply only recommended herbicides at recommended dose, proper time, as appropriate spray solution with standard equipment along with flat fan or flat jet nozzles.

9.  Maintain opimum and healthy crop stand which would be capable of competing with weeds at a critical stage of crop weed competition.

10. Use NPK fertilizers as per the soil test recommendation.

11. Use micronutrient mixture after sowing test recommendations.

12. Conduct AESA weekly in the morning preferably before 9 a.m. Take decision on management practice based on AESA, ETL, and PD ratio only.

13. Install pheromone traps at appropriate period.

14. Release parasites only after noticing adult moth catches in the pheromone trap or as pheromone trap or as per field observation.

15. Apply HaNPV, SINPV at recommended dose when a large number of egg masses and early instar larvae are noticed. Apply NPV only in the evening hours after 5 pm.

  Don’t

  Soil incorporation of fluchloralin should not be delayed or avoided for achieving effective weed control.

  Pre-emergency as well as soil incorporated herbicides should not be applied in dry soils. Do not apply herbicides alongwith irrigation water or by mixing with soil, sand or urea.

  Crops should not be exposed to moisture deficit stress at their critical growth stages.

  Avoid imbalanced use of fertilizers.

  Avoid imbalanced use of fertilizers

  Do not apply chemical pesticides on calendar basis.

  Do not store the pheromone lures at normal room temperature (keep them in refrigerator).

  Do not apply chemical pesticides within seven days of release of parasites.

  Do not use the same sprayer for application of chemical pesticides and biocides.

  Do’s

16. In case of pests which are active during night like Spodoptera spray recommended biocides/chemicals at the time of their appearance in the night.

17. Spray pesticides thoroughly to treat the undersurface of the leaves, particularly for mites, Spodoptera, Epilachna grubs etc.

18. Apply short persistent pesticides to avoid pesticide residue in the soil and produce.

19. Maintain isolation distance of minimum 200 m in cucurbits between varieties to avoid contamination in cross pollination.

20. Follow the recommended procedure of trap crop technology on tomato and Cole crops.

  Don’t

  Do not apply pesticides/biocides when it is not absolutely required.

  Do not spray pesticides at midday since, most of the insects are not active during this period.

  Do not apply pesticides during preceding 7 days before harvest.

  Do not spray insecticides during flowering season of cucurbits to protect honeybees, which helps in cross pollination.

  Do not apply long persistent on trap crop, otherwise it may not attract the pests and natural enemies.
