# **Guidelines of BPKP Programme**

**Implementation Strategy**

***Selection of area and beneficiaries***

* Dry lands, rainfed areas and tribal areas are to be given preference. Small and marginal farm holders, including tenant farmers, to be the preferred target group.

The cluster size will be of 1000 ha at the block level, that is, in each selected block, one cluster will be formed. In a block, around 4–5 gram panchayats (10 villages) covering an area of around 1000 ha will be selected. Preference will be given to areas where social mobilization and presence of women self- help groups are strong. As far as possible, commodity-based clusters will be taken up. In the case the cluster size is below 1000 ha, funds will be reduced proportionately. But in any case, the cluster size should not be less than 500 ha.

* Convergence with schemes of DAC\&FW and other ministries and departments will be ensured wherever possible. For example, convergence with FPO scheme of MoA\&FW, DAHDF on issues related to the purchase and maintenance of cows and establishment of goshalas; convergence with NRLM/MKSP and other schemes of MoRD for utilizing socially mobilized groups; convergence with the seed village programme of DAC\&FW for organic seed production; convergence with MIDH for the promotion of horticulture crops, etc.
