Under NFSNM, the incentives are provided to the farmers, through the States/UTs, on crop production and protection technologies, cropping system based demonstrations, production & distribution of certified seeds of newly released varieties/hybrids, integrated nutrient and pest management techniques, capacity building of farmers through trainings during cropping season etc.

  Further, the Government of India also provides flexibility to the states for state specific needs/priorities under Pradhan Mantri-Rashtirya Krishi Vikas Yojana (PM-RKVY). The states may promote coarse cereals and millets (Shree Anna) under PM-RKVY with approval of State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) headed by Chief Secretary of the State.
