# **Sub:** \- **Suggestion on the guiding principles for Comprehensive Ecological Restoration of the degraded forest and non\- forest lands-reg.**

Sir,

It is to inform you that **the Executive Committee of National Authority** in the **29111 meeting** held on I 5th May, 2024 decided that the Compensatory Afforestation and afforestation activities under Assisted Natural Regeneration, Artificial Regeneration, Plantations under NPV component should aim for comprehensive ecological restoration of the degraded forest or non­ forest areas. Therefore, all the necessary activities required for ecological restoration should be mapped for a given site and accordingly cost estimates are to be worked out. An indicative list of activities/ components is given below: \-

1. # **Preparatory or Pre-Plantation Phase Activities:**

   1. Survey of Compensatory Afforestation and other afforestation (ANR/AR) sites

   2. Preparation of KML file and uploading it on e-Green watch portal & State Forest website.

   3. For CA and other mandatory afforestation activities, the sites should be the same as per the FCA approval.

   4. Securing the area by boundary demarcation and fencing as per site requirement

   5. Assessment of Flora & Fauna for baseline data on biodiversity for the agro-climatic, edaphic and geographical conditions.

   6. Study of drivers of forest/site degradation and remedial measures for addressing them.

   7. Site Preparation/ soil testing and measures for improvement of soil quality

   8. Removal/ control of invasive species

   9. Soil Moisture Conservation measures

   10. Measures for Fire prevention and control

   11. Raising of Nursery of locally appropriate species.

   12. Community Participation & Stakeholder Engagement

2. # **Plantation Phase:**

   1. Afforestation and Reforestation

   2. Promotion of natural regeneration, protection of mother trees, treatment of root stock, singling of coppice shoots etc.

   3. Restorative ecology for facilitating growth of grass, shrubs etc.

   4. Enrichment of biodiversity with planting of suitable local species Biodiversity

Conservation

5. Engagement of required professionals for supervision & implementation.

3. # **Post Plantation:**

   1\.  Maintenance of plantation

   11\.  Cultural operation

   111\. Record maintenance

   iv.	Monitoring and Evaluation framework for regular assessment of Eco restoration status.

4. # **Post Plantation Strategy:**

   1\.	Recording of completion certificate ofCA/ANR/AR.

   11\.	Supervision/ protection of afforested areas after completion of the CA/ANR/AR.

   iii.	Evaluation and Assessment of Eco- restoration periodically.

The cost estimates for holistic ecological restoration should accordingly be prepared to include all the activities required for the purpose.

It is requested to suggest your inputs/comments in this regard for making a guidelines principle for holistic Eco-restoration under CAMPA.

Your faithfully,

# **(Subha**

Chief Executive Officer
