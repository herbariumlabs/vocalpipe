  []MISHTI: "Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats and Tangible Incomes" has been announced in para 85 of the Union Budget of 2023-24 to promote and conserve mangroves as unique, natural ecosystem having very high biological productivity and carbon sequestration potential, besides working as a bio-shield. The Mission objectives also strengthen our efforts to address impacts of climate change in terms of green economy in convergence with other schemes and Programmes, prominently MGNREGS.

2.  MISHTI aims to preserve and enhance the sustainability of the coastal habitats like mangroves, salt marshes and mudflats leading to ecological resilience of the country's coastal ecosystems bringing socio-economic benefits to coastal communities.

3.  Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is a demand driven scheme under Ministry of Rural Development, which also aims for efficient use of natural resources through inter-sectoral approach for, inter alia, strengthening the livelihood resource base of the poor.

4.  Now, to further synergize these efforts and to collectively address the climate change concerns, convergence guidelines of MISHTI and Mahatma Gandhi NREGS have been framed (copy enclosed). These guidelines outline the context of convergence and set out the approach to be adopted to strengthen the coordination at field level.

5.  We trust that this integrated development approach with climate change adaptation and mitigation concerns will also benefit Mahatma Gandhi NREGS leading to better quality planning and selection of works capable of generating sustainable employment.

  JOINT GUIDELINES FOR CONVERGENCE OF MISSION MISHTI ANDMAHATMA GANDHI NREGS FOR PROMOTION OF MANGROVE PLANTATION

  These guidelines outline the modalities of convergence between the MISHTI: "Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats and Tangible Incomes" and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) so as to enhance multiple ecosystem services and achieve resilience to climate change of the country's coastal ecosystems bringing socio­ economic benefits to local communities.

1.  Background

  Mangrove forests have more capacity to store carbon, provide breeding grounds for marine biodiversity and support global fish populations. The Government has taken a number of steps to protect and enhance mangrove forests in coastal States/Union Territories through promotional as well as regulatory measures. Union Budget 2023-24 announced 'Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes (MISHTI)' to promote and conserve mangroves as unique, natural eco-system having very high biological productivity and carbon sequestration potential, besides working as a bio shield. Accordingly, MISHTI was launched by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change on World Environment Day i.e., 5^(th) June 2023

  Mission MISHTI has been started after India joined the 'Mangrove Alliance for Climate' during the 27th Conference of Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Egypt in November 2022. The Mission aims to preserve and enhance the sustainability of the coastal habitats like mangroves, sea grasses, coral reefs, salt marshes and mudflats leading to ecological resilience of the country's coastal ecosystems bringing socio­ economic benefits to coastal communities. It is being implemented in nine Coastal States and four Union Territories.

  Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is a demand driven scheme administered by Ministry of Rural Development, aims at assuring unskilled wage employment up to 100 days to rural families through creation of durable and productive assets both at the community level as also for selected category of individual beneficiaries through development of land, water and trees. It also aims for efficient use of natural resources through inter-sectoral approach for, inter alia, strengthening the livelihood resource base of the poor.

2.  Mission MISHTI under the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change

  Mission MISHTI aims to enhance resilience of Indian coast and ensure the protection of coastal life, livelihood and infrastructure against the climate change consequences such as sea-level rise through conservation and management of coastal habitats. It aims to increase the mangrove cover to the extent of 540 square km areas across 9 coastal states and four Union Territories in five years (2023-2028).

  Categorization of targeted areas for this programme:

a.  Mangrove plantation/restoration of gap or degraded areas or accretion areas,

b.  Mangrove restoration of mudflat areas (areas that had historical mangroves),

c.  Mangrove restoration in abandoned aquaculture ponds & salt pans, and

d.  Rehabilitation of areas infested with invasive or alien species having mangrove potential.

  The Year wise work plan for 5 years of cycle for the activities under the Mission MISTHI is detailed below.
