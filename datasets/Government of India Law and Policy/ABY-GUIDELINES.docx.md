# Chapter 1: Background {#chapter-1:-background}

1. ## Context {#context}

1. Groundwater has played an important role in increasing food and agricultural production, providing safe drinking water and facilitating industrial development in India. It contributes fresh water to meet the requirement of nearly 62% of total irrigated area, nearly 85% of the rural drinking water supply and 50% of the urban drinking water needs of the country. Over the last three decades, the rapid expansion in the use of groundwater	, primarily for irrigation, has contributed significantly to its agricultural production and overall economic development. This has also resulted in India becoming the largest groundwater extractor in the World.

2. The rapid and extensive extraction of groundwater , however, has come at a price. The limited groundwater resources in the country are under threat due to indiscriminate use. Intensive and unregulated groundwater    pumping in many areas

   has caused rapid and widespread decline in groundwater levels. As per the latest Dynamic Groundwater Resources Assessment  (2022), carried out by CGWB jointly with the States, out of total number of 7089 blocks / mandals /taluks / firqas , 1006 have been categorised  as ‘Over exploited’, meaning that the groundwater  extracted for various purposes from these areas is more than what is replenished annually from rainfall and other sources. Further, as per studies conducted

   by CGWB, the average stage of groundwater extraction for the country as a whole works out to be about 60.08%.

   \- There is, therefore, an urgent need for improving groundwater governance and management in the country.

   Impact of climate change on groundwater  is emerging as a major challenge. The increasing variability in rainfall could mean more frequent and prolonged periods of droughts and floods. The effects of climate change on groundwater may result in a long term decline in groundwater storage, saline intrusion in coastal aquifers due to sea level rise and overall resource reduction. Therefore, sustainable groundwater	management, aimed at ensuring sufficient groundwater for the future generations is essential to mitigate such adverse impacts.

   Decline in the storage and availability of groundwater is likely to adversely affect all sectors of the economy.

4. Various interventions, taken up as part of the Central and State Government Schemes such as MGNREGS, PMKSY, State Schemes etc. have succeeded in replenishment of groundwater resources to some extent and consequent rise in groundwater levels in some areas of the country. However, there is still no significant improvement in the existing groundwater management practices or in the status of groundwater resources at Block/District levels in major parts of the country. This could be due to various reasons, including lack of scientific data/knowledge at appropriate levels in various interventions, unscientific location of recharge/ harvesting structures, focus on issues other than groundwater, lack of attention to prioritisation of the water-stressed areas etc. Analysis of the efforts made so far indicate that the emphasis has been on measures aimed at increasing the availability of groundwater (supply side measures) rather than reducing the demand (demand side measures). In general, there has been limited community involvement in planning, execution and maintenance of structures constructed under such schemes. There are, however, some instances where community and stakeholders’ participation in groundwater management has been able to make a significant positive impact on the groundwater regime.  
5. In recent years, there have been several promising attempts at groundwater management with community participation in different parts of the country. These include the Andhra Pradesh Farmer Managed Groundwater System (APFAMGS), and water budget-based holistic water management in Hiwre Bazaar village in Maharashtra. These pilot initiatives have demonstrated how demand for groundwater  can be reduced if timely information on groundwater availability is provided to communities, multiple agencies work together and communities are engaged in the planning process. Most of these success stories of participatory groundwater management are community driven and self-financed which, at times, become a bottleneck in replicating such initiatives elsewhere.

6. With time, the government and policy makers have recognized the potential of community led groundwater management and the need to institutionalise such initiatives through convergence of Govt. initiatives with emphasis on demand side management and behavioural change for ensuring the long-term sustainability of groundwater  in the country. The Atal  Bhujal Yojana is a major step in this direction.

   2. ## Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal) {#atal-bhujal-yojana-(atal-jal)}

7. The goal of Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal) is to demonstrate community-led sustainable groundwater  management which can be taken to scale. The major objective of the Scheme is to improve the management of groundwater resources in the selected water stressed areas in identified states viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

8. Atal Jal is targeted at sustainable groundwater management, mainly through convergence among various on-going schemes with the active involvement of local communities and stakeholders. This will ensure that in the Scheme area, the funds allocated by the Central and concerned State governments are spent judiciously to ensure long term sustainability of groundwater	resources	. The convergence shall further result in incentives to State Governments for suitable investments, aided by strong data base, scientific approach and community participation. The scheme has been designed as a pilot with the principal objective of strengthening the institutional framework for participatory groundwater  management. It also aims at bringing about behavioural   change at the community level through awareness programs

   and capacity building for fostering sustainable groundwater  management in the participating States

   3. ## Program Guidelines {#program-guidelines}

9. The primary purpose of the Program Guidelines (PG) is to define the framework, policies and procedures for effective implementation of the scheme. It is acknowledged that there will be learnings based on the experience of implementation of the program and therefore the program guidelines will  be revised from time to time. These Program Guidelines shall, therefore, be a **living document** and will serve as a ready reference to the implementing agencies at the national, state, district and Gram Panchayat (GP) levels.

   The present Program Guideline is version 1.2, a revision over Version 1.1, here attempt has been made to incorporate key changes taken place in the programs design/ implementation. This will be the guide for all activities related to Atal Bhujal Yojana. The current PG and its subsequent revisions will be available online at: https://ataljal.mowr.gov.in/.

    # Chapter	2:	Program	Description	and Components {#chapter-2:-program-description-and-components}

    1. ## Program description {#program-description}

1. **Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal)** is a Central Sector Scheme with an outlay of INR 6000 crore, out of which INR 3,000 crore will be as loan from the World Bank and INR 3,000 crore as matching contribution from the Government of India (GoI). The funds under the scheme shall be provided to the states as grants-in-aid. The World Bank financing will be done under a new lending instrument, that is, Program for Results (P for R), wherein funds under the scheme will be disbursed from the World Bank to the GoI based on achievement of pre-agreed results.

2. The scheme will be implemented over a period of five years from 2020-21 till 2024-25.

3. The States for implementation of the scheme, viz. Gujarat,  Haryana,   Karnataka,   Madhya   Pradesh,

   Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh  have been selected according to a number of criteria, including degree of groundwater exploitation and degradation, established legal and regulatory instruments, institutional readiness, and experience in implementing initiatives related to groundwater management. The selected states account for about 37% of the total number of water- stressed (overexploited, critical and semi-critical) blocks in India. They are underlain by two broad types of aquifer systems found in India i.e alluvial or unconsolidated aquifers and hard rock or consolidated aquifers and span a broad spectrum in terms of established legal and regulatory provisions, institutional readiness and experience in groundwater management. The districts/Blocks/ Gram Panchayats for implementation of the scheme in the identified States have been finalised by the respective States. In general, these areas are over-exploited or water stressed. Addressing various challenges with respect to groundwater including over-exploitation is expected to have a significant impact in ensuring sustainable management of available groundwater resources in these States.

4. The details of the area  of implementation of Atal Bhujal Yojana is given in Table 2.1. Table 2.1. Details of area of implementation of Atal Bhujal Yojana

| S.No. | State | Districts | Blocks | GPs |
| :---: | ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | Gujarat | 6 | 36 | 1873 |
| 2 | Haryana | 14 | 36 | 1656 |
| 3 | Karnataka | 14 | 41 | 1,199 |
| 4 | Madhya Pradesh | 6 | 9 | 670 |
| 5 | Maharashtra | 13 | 43 | 1133 |

| 6 | Rajasthan | 17 | 38 | 1139 |

| 7 | Uttar Pradesh | 10 | 26 | 550 |
|  | **TOTAL** | **80** | **229** | **8220** |

5. The present scheme would encourage community engagement and inculcate behavioural changes for judicious groundwater management at Gram Panchayat level. This participatory approach is crucial for addressing groundwater challenges in the long term. In fact, this is the first scheme of its kind which will involve community-based planning; monitoring; sharing and use of groundwater data; capacity building of all stakeholders to demystify the complex science of groundwater	; community led groundwater management through a combination of demand side / supply side management measures.

6. The scheme will also support participating states in applying alternative approaches to groundwater governance through direct engagement with groundwater users and beneficiaries. The critical role of the central agencies will be in the demystification of science required for groundwater management, facilitating training and other capacity building, and providing uniform standards and guidelines for quality assurance and coherence across participating States.

7. A strong institutional structure has been proposed with appropriate linkages to ensure enhanced participation of state departments/agencies. Stakeholders involvement at the local/community level in planning and implementation of interventions shall be ensured through a participatory groundwater management approach.

8. This scheme is designed to facilitate sustainable groundwater management by operationalizing a results-oriented approach. This is to be done through incentivizing behavioural change in the planning, design, and implementation of groundwater-related investments and interventions.

9. Strengthening the institutional and information framework will be a key feature in sustainable groundwater management. Developing a strong evidence base on the extent of the challenges and criticality in addressing them as part of this scheme will pave the way for more reforms in the longer run.

   2. ## Objective {#objective}

10. The primary objective of this Scheme is “to improve the management of groundwater resources in the water stressed areas of the selected States.” This will be achieved by implementing appropriate investments/management actions led by the community  through convergence of various ongoing /new central and state schemes.

    3. ## Components of Atal Bhujal Yojana (ATAL JAL) {#components-of-atal-bhujal-yojana-(atal-jal)}

11. The scheme has two components, viz. i) Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building Component, aimed at strengthening the groundwater governance mechanism in the participating States and ii) Incentive Component, aimed at rewarding/incentivizing the States for various measures aimed at ensuring the long-term sustainability of groundwater resources. Through a combination of

    institutional strengthening, community mobilisation, convergence among ongoing schemes and incentivization of good performance, the scheme aims to bring synergy among various on-going schemes and ensure benefits and dividends at minimal cost in the identified groundwater stressed areas.

    1. #### Institutional Strengthening & Capacity Building Component

12. The component strengthening institutional arrangements and capacity in the states is for enabling them to sustainably manage their groundwater. Expenditure under this component shall include (a) expenditure on training and capacity building to enhance institutional capacity for effective groundwater management at all levels (including costs of engaging experts/consultants, engagement of District Implementation Partners (DIPs) equipment etc.); (b) costs of Monitoring & Evaluation (M\&E), independent verification, audit fees, Program management etc.

    2. #### Incentive Component

13. Under this component, funds will be released to state agencies for incentivizing or rewarding the states that bring convergence among various schemes of the central and state governments as well as to take up interventions promoting sustainable groundwater management through community participation. The disbursement under this component will be linked with the performance of states against the identified Disbursement Linked  Indicators (DLIs)

    3. #### Scheme Outlay

14. The scheme outlay under the two components mentioned above are as below:

| S.No. | Component | Outlay (Rs. in crore) |  | Total (Rs. in crore) |
| ----- | ----- | :---: | :---: | ----- |
|  |  | Govt. of India | World Bank |  |
| 1 | Institutional Strengthening & Capacity Building | 1400 | \- | 1400 |
| 2 | Incentive Component | 1600 | 3000 | 4600 |
|  | **TOTAL** | **3000** | **3000** | **6000** |

15. For expenditure under the Incentive Component, the  disbursements	from the World Bank to the DoWR, RD\&GR shall be based on the states’ aggregated achievements in respect of each of the DLIs. The cycle of disbursement on achievement of results associated with each DLI and their verification by the Third Party Government Verification Agency (TPGVA) will be repeated  as per requirement.

    4. ## Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) {#disbursement-linked-indicators-(dlis)}

16. These are result indicators linked to disbursement of funds by the World Bank under the Incentive component of the scheme. Funds shall be  disbursed subject to achievement of the result indicators by the implementing agencies. Selection of DLIs has been guided by (i) activities which need to be done for sustainable management of groundwater, (ii) measurability and ease of verification and (iii) capacity of stakeholders to achieve the results. Taken together, these DLIs, while focusing on the objective of the Scheme, provide incentives for achieving key milestones towards the ultimate goal of the scheme i.e. Improving groundwater management with community participation.

17. The achievement of DLIs results in disbursements of the funds to the states based on their measurement and verification by a third party Verification Agency. Once the incentives are received, they may be used for any activity for groundwater improvement covered under Atal Bhujal Yojana.

18. Five DLIs have been selected out of which the first four DLIs incentivise the activities leading to sustainable management of groundwater while the fifth DLI is related to the outcome of the first four DLIs. The DLIs have been defined as below:

    DLI\#1 \- ***Public disclosure of groundwater data / information and reports:*** This DLI incentivizes the strengthening of groundwater management institutions to ensure collection and public disclosure of groundwater related information.

    DLI\#2 \- ***Preparation of Community-led Water Security Plans.*** This incentivizes the roll-out of a standardized bottom-up participatory groundwater management process.

    DLI\#3 \- ***Public financing of approved Water Security Plans through convergence of ongoing/new schemes.*** The DLI incentivizes the use of the standardised  bottom-up groundwater planning process to improve the effectiveness of public financing and align implementation of various government programs on groundwater.

    DLI\#4 \- ***Adoption of practices for efficient water use*** which incentivize the implementation of demand-side measures within the WSPs and signals the importance of shifting focus away from supply side  measures toward demand-side measures to improve groundwater conditions.

    DLI\#5 ***Improvement in the rate of decline of groundwater levels*** incentivizes the arrest in decline of groundwater levels

19. A more detailed description of the DLIs are provided in Chapter 5 of this document

    5. ## Scheme Costs {#scheme-costs}

20. The estimated cost of Atal Bhujal Yojana is INR 6,000 over five years, divided between the GoI and the World Bank. The breakdown of the financing is as shown in T  able 2.2.

    ## 2.6.  Program Scope and Boundaries {#2.6.-program-scope-and-boundaries}

22. The scheme envisages addressing four critical issues relating to sustainable groundwater management, i.e. state-specific institutional frameworks for sustainable groundwater management; enhancement of groundwater recharge; improvement of water use efficiency; and strengthening of community-based institutions to foster groundwater  management.

23. A set of typical interventions that qualify under Atal Bhujal Yojana are as follows:

    1) **Demand-side interventions.** Practices for efficient water use in agriculture, including, but not limited to,

       1) Micro-irrigation practices such as drip/sprinkler systems;

       2) Use of recycled / reused water for irrigation, water collection ponds between agricultural fields to trap excess water/rainwater for reuse of same for micro-irrigation

1) Use of recycled / reused water for irrigation

2) Underground pipelines to provide piped water for micro irrigation systems;

3) Pressurised irrigation in canal command areas;

4) Crop diversification including promotion of rainfed horticulture, seed replacement: drought and flood resilient seeds, and other such interventions where there is reduction in use of water for agricultural production/ groundwater recharge measures,

5) Feeder separation for irrigation power supply; evacuation of solar power ) to the grid and

6) Any other area-specific water efficient/water-saving methods and innovative practices.

   2) **Supply-side interventions.** Artificial recharge and water conservation structures, including, but not limited to,

      1) Check dams;

      2) Percolation ponds, and other equivalent small water storage structures.

      3) Contour bunds/trenches;

      4) Drainage line treatment (ridge to valley approach);

      5) Recharge trenches/shafts/wells;

      6) Small scale Vented dams / bandharas / bandharas under existing bridges and so on;

      7) Sub-surface dykes;

      8) Farm ponds;

      9) Gully plugs/nala bunds/gabions; and

      10) Any other area-specific recharge/water conservation/rainwater harvesting method.

   ## 2.7  Challenge Method under Atal Bhujal Yojana {#2.7-challenge-method-under-atal-bhujal-yojana}

24. The incentivization money under the scheme is fungible and the scheme incorporates the principles of the ‘Challenge Method’ suggested by the Cabinet Secretariat and NITI Aayog, that is, (a) selection of most appropriate sites: area identified on the basis of groundwater stress; (b) commitment of stakeholders: participatory process and involvement of all concerned departments;

    (c) encouraging  innovation and technology: through use of latest remote sensing and GIS; (d) speedy implementation: ensured by timely verification of results; (e) transparency and accountability: through MIS(Management Information System), Atal Jal App and geotagging; and (f) promoting of competitive federalism where non performing	states/districts /blocks /Gram panchayats will not qualify for disbursement and resources will be reallocated to performing ones.

25. Thus, the Institutional strengthening & Capacity building Component of INR 1,400 crore shall cover the entire scheme area, that is 8220 GPs as proposed by the states. The GPs shall, therefore, benefit from the institutional strengthening as the foundation to reap the benefit from the scheme. This would comprise activities like construction of piezometers, installation of equipment like DWLRs and rain gauges, water flow meter, distribution of Water level indicator, Water Testing kit, upgrading of laboratories, data centres, capacity building for water budgeting, preparation of WSPs, assistance from PIA, SPMU and DPMUs and so on.

26. The Incentive Component shall be worked out based on actual achievement of GPs/blocks. Thus, it is proposed to include 8220 GPs distributed across all the states to be considered under this component of Atal Bhujal Yojana. Because the incentives are performance based, this will motivate states to give their best in achieving the results to stake higher claims in ‘Incentives’ under the scheme. Thus, well-performing states shall be entitled to higher funds as compared to the non performing ones. Atal Bhujal Yojana, therefore, is one of the few schemes to adopt the ‘Challenge Method’ and also in keeping with the principles of 15th Finance Commission which proposes to promote competitive federalism.

    ## 2.8.  Program Exclusions {#2.8.-program-exclusions}

27. Some potential investment categories which will be excluded from Atal Bhujal Yojana are

    1) Construction of major/minor dams, barrage (large and medium) and new large-scale irrigation systems; and

    2) Major industrial wastewater collection, treatment, and recharging the same through injection.

28. In addition, activities that are likely to have significant adverse impacts on the environment that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented and/or affect people are not eligible for financing under the Program.

29. Similarly, activities that involve procurement of works, goods, and services of high-value contracts will normally not be eligible for financing under Atal Jal. Therefore, Atal Jal will exclude activities that involve procurement of (a) works, estimated to cost INR 300 crore or more per contract; (b) goods, estimated to cost INR 180 crore or more per contract; (c) non- consulting services, estimated to cost INR 120 crore or more per contract; and (d) consulting services, estimated to cost INR 90 crore or more per contract.

    # Chapter 3: Activities {#chapter-3:-activities}

1. Atal Bhujal Yojana envisages specific activities at the Gram Panchayat, District, State and National levels to achieve the stated objectives. These are described in detail in the following sections:

   1. ## Gram Panchayat (GP) Level {#gram-panchayat-(gp)-level}

2. Important activities at the GP level will include: i) ensuring community participation in planning sustainable management of groundwater; ii) development of GP level water budget; iii) preparation of GP-level Water Security Plan (WSP); Iv) Assistance in implementation of WSP; v) taking part in social audit and vi) Utilization and management of Assets created in the Scheme.

3. The planning process at the GP level will start with awareness creation and sensitization of the local communities, followed by the measurement of groundwater levels and rainfall. The equipment for measurement (Digital Water Level Recorders, Hand held tapes / sounders, simple rain gauges and water quality testing kits) are procured by the State Program Management Units (SPMUs). Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLRs) are installed in earmarked piezometers / dug wells to have continuous record of data. Each Gram Panchayat would have one DWLR, the data from which will be received at different levels including the MIS of Atal Jal and NWIC. Volunteers from the Gram Panchayats will be identified and trained by the District Implementation Partners (DIP) in data collection. There will be one hand held tape / sounders, rain gauge and water quality testing kit for each GP. The data collected will be made available to the public by the GP by displaying it at prominent places in the GP (Panchayat Office, Schools etc.). The data collected by volunteers and received from DWLRs will be analysed, interpreted and published as a report at Block Level. This data would serve as a valuable input for water budgeting and preparation of Water Security Plans. This data will also be suitably disclosed to the general public in order to make them aware about the groundwater situation in their area. Standard guidelines on operation, maintenance and data acquisition from these equipment have been circulated to the States.

   Standard data collection templates along with probable data sources shall be provided for preparation of baseline  data at GP level. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of data will be subjected to primary validation in respect of specific parameters like groundwater level, rainfall, soil health and cropping pattern through historical data available with concerned agencies at central and state level viz. CGWB, Dept. of Agriculture and IMD.

4. A water budget is an account of the available water resources and their various uses at the GP level. The purpose of the water budget is to assess surface and groundwater resources and identify current and future needs as a basis for planning. The water budget will be prepared by the GP with the support of the Water Management Committees, aided by the District Implementation Partners

   engaged. It will be updated on a regular basis (at least once every year).

5. Water Security Plans (WSPs) will be prepared on the basis of water budgets. WSPs will cover a period of five years. However, the water security plans shall be updated every year. The plans will specify investments and interventions to meet the anticipated demands while ensuring sustainable water use. WSPs will be customised to meet the specific challenges in the GP and include any water- related investments/interventions that serve the purpose. The plans will be prepared by the GP with the support of the Water Management Committee (WMC)/ Village Water and Sanitation Committee (VWSC)/Participatory Groundwater Management Committee (PGWMC) as the case may be. Care will be taken to ensure that measures/ interventions to ensure sustainability of groundwater-based sources of drinking water supply are incorporated in the WSPs by establishing necessary linkages with agencies dealing with the Jal Jeevan Mission Scheme at the GP level. The plans will be approved by the concerned GP.

6. The GP will be guided and assisted in preparing water budgets and WSPs by DIPs engaged by the. These persons/agencies will work hand in hand with community water groups (such as WUAs, Village Water and Sanitation Committees, or other similar entities) that are established or strengthened under the Scheme. This will ensure community participation in the process, ownership of its outcome, and consistency with the Program objectives. For groundwater management, community participation is particularly critical because groundwater is a common pool resource, which requires a collective response.

7. The detailed break-up of the activities envisaged at the GP level is given in **Table 3.1.**

# Chapter 4: Institutional Arrangements {#chapter-4:-institutional-arrangements}

1. Atal Bhujal Yojana is a unique, time-bound scheme aimed at sustainable groundwater management with community participation, which needs robust institutional arrangements for successful implementation. A four-tier institutional mechanism at National, State, District and Gram Panchayat levels with necessary linkages has been envisaged under the scheme as shown in Fig. 4.1.

   ##### **Fig. 4.1 Institutional Arrangements for Implementation of Atal Bhujal Yojana**

2. The arrangements at various levels are described briefly in the following sections.

   1. ## National Level {#national-level}

3. Brief descriptions of the DLIs are given below.

   1. ###### **DLI \#1**: ***Public disclosure of groundwater data / information and reports***

   ***(numbers)***: The disbursement of funds under this DLI is linked to groundwater monitoring and disclosure of groundwater data by the stakeholders. Hydrologic data will be collected and disseminated at the GP level. Data from all participating GPs in a block will be collected, compiled, collated and brought out as a report at the block level. Thus, this DLI consists of two sub-indicators measuring (a) the

   number of GPs for which periodic water-level data is available and (b) the number of block-level reports on groundwater quantity and quality data made available online in the public domain. The collected data need to be disclosed to the general public in an appropriate way. The disbursement of incentive under the DLI is subject to performance of the states to be verified by the Third-Party Government Verification Agency (TPGVA) as per the standard protocol developed for the purpose. The verification protocols developed for verification of successful occurrences so far is provided in link of Ataljal Portal.

The verification protocols developed for verification of successful occurrences against the DLI’s so far is provided in the Atal Jal website (ataljal.mowr.gov.in)

    # Chapter 6: Training, Capacity Building & Awareness Creation {#chapter-6:-training,-capacity-building-&-awareness-creation}

    1. ## Introduction {#introduction-1}

1. As Atal Bhujal Yojana is a scheme aimed primarily at inculcating behavioural changes among the stakeholders to facilitate judicious use of groundwater, training and capacity building have a vital role to play in ensuring its success. Capacity development activities aim to strengthen individuals, groups, institutions, organisations, or systems to make them more effective program partners. The goal of the capacity development program under the Atal Bhujal Yojana is to  
   maximise development effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and ownership. It is done by ensuring that all stakeholders can manage and deliver intended products and services to their target groups practically, efficiently, resilient, and self-sufficiently. Training is one form of capacity building, which mainly aims at skill development. Training and capacity building activities in ATAL JAL will be at four levels viz., i) Gram Panchayat; ii) District; iii) State and iv) National. Capacity development also includes study or exposure visits and cross learning through various methods.

2. **GP/ Block level:** Empowering the community through a series of cascading training and capacity-building activities is one of the core activities under Atal Jal. Capacities required at GP/Block level include skills in community mobilisation, data collection (both technical and non-technical), water budgeting and preparation of Water Security Plan (WSP). Key persons at this level include elected members of GP/Block, Water Management Committee (WMC) / Village Water and Sanitation Committee (VWSC), Water User Association (WUA). Women drawn from the existing Self-Help Groups (SHGs) would constitute a substantial number of the WMC/VWMC. WMC/VWMC is seen as the driver of community participation in the program with hand holding by District Implementing Partner (DIP) and District Program Management Unit (DPMU). Local trained volunteers (Bhujal Mitra) / Community Resource Parsons (CRP) will collect groundwater level data, rainfall and water quality in their villages. They will be trained to use the equipment’s procured under the scheme to measures key parameters such as groundwater level, rainfall and key water quality parameters and interpret to make sense of the data from a village perspective of what is happening to village groundwater availability in terms of quantity and quality. The volunteers will also disseminate the information among the community to enable them to take informed decisions in activities e.g. farming that involves groundwater use. The data collected will also be used in water budgeting and development of WSPs. Mobile Application has been developed for collection of village level data on various parameters and feeding into the Management Information System (MIS) developed for the scheme. These volunteers will be an important link between village communities and Gram Panchayats and will act as local resource persons in the development and implementation of WSP, specific skill development programs shall be organized for them.

3. **District/Division level:** Capacities required at this level include skills in data compilation (both technical and non-technical), review of GP water budgets, review of GP level WSPs, preparation of District level plans for implementation of WSPs and preparation of District Annual Work Plan (AWP) and Budget. Staff of DPMU will need to be trained formally in various aspects of water budgeting and WSP

   compilation, lest they will not be able to review and approve GP level WSPs. Convergence is another key area where DPMU is expected to play a key role by roping in funds from other ongoing Central / State Sector schemes. Thus, knowledge of ongoing programs is essential for the DPMU functionaries. This capacity can be developed through a start-up orientation and regular updating. Government personnel working at the grass-root level such as Agriculture Extension Officers, Junior Engineers, etc. will be crucial for facilitating the scheme activities to the grassroot level, and therefore will essentially be part of the capacity building program of ATAL JAL. District level functionaries will be trained as Master Trainers and are expected to conduct cascade training for the experts of DPMU and District Implementation Partners on both technical and social aspects.

4. **State level:** Capacities required at this level include skills in data compilation and management (both technical and non-technical); handling Management Information System (MIS) and Grievance Redressal  System; review of District water budgets, WSPs, Annual Work Plans (AWP) and Budgets; compilation of State water budget, WSP and AWP & Budget; development of mass communication strategy; conducting training programs for GP/Block and District level functionaries; and program monitoring and reporting. Though staff of SPMU will come with many of these skills, they need to be oriented  with start-up training  on certain aspects. State level functionaries will be trained as Master Trainers and are expected to conduct cascade training at District level on both technical and social subjects. Orientations, training, exposure visits, cross learning via workshops should be conducted for various stakeholders including the line departments.

5. National level: Capacities required at this level include skills in data management (both technical and non-technical); operating and maintaining Management Information System (MIS) and Grievance Redressal System; review of State water budgets, GWSPs, AWPs and Budgets; developing mass communication strategy; developing training modules or content for different forms of capacity building interventions; conducting training programs for State level functionaries; program monitoring and reporting. The capacity of NPMU staff will need to be strengthened in certain aspects through suitable training. Training calendars will be prepared annually at national and state levels for systematic training.

   NPMU shall also adopt the capsule training strategy of ‘’Low dose high frequency’’ and/or ‘’high dose low frequency’’ on various technical and social topics based on the need.

   2. ## Training Institutions {#training-institutions}

6. At the grass root level, the focus would be on first- hand knowledge of participatory groundwater monitoring and management approaches. Linkages would be established with pioneers of participatory groundwater management (Hiware Bazaar, Pipalantri, MARVI) as well as with the Implementation Support Agencies (ISA) operating under the Jal Jeevan Mission so that local stakeholders form Atal Jal areas can interact with local farmers and field staff to gain insights for implementing participatory groundwater monitoring and management. The responsibility of training/capacity building at the district level would lie with the District Implementing Partner (DIP). Inputs

   and experiences gained through the Public Interaction Programs (PIPs) being organised by Regional offices of CGWB as part of the National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM) program would play a crucial role in sensitization, training and capacity building of stakeholders at this level.

7. States have a number of organisations / institutes which have the required expertise in training and capacity building. State Institutes of Rural Development (SIRD), Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI) and State Institutes for Agriculture Management (SIMA) are examples. PIAs/ SPMUs will be free to identify and engage such institutes / organisations for capacity building at the State level. Wherever NGOs/CBOs are proposed to be engaged, procurement of the same shall be subjected to compliance with the state GFR’s applicable procurement procedures /guidelines for recruitment of such services

8. At the national level, the Rajiv Gandhi National Groundwater Training and Research Institute (RGNGWTRI), the training arm of CGWB, may be roped in by the NPMU to conduct training and capacity building activities at program level, depending on the need and time. Possibility of soliciting the services of national level Organisations such as NIRDPR and NGOs such as, ARGHYAM, MARVI, AFPRO, Pani Foundation in the training activities at the National level can also be explored.

   3. ## Capacity Development Activities: Training/Workshop/Hand-holding {#capacity-development-activities:-training/workshop/hand-holding}

9. Three broad capacity development activities in ATAL JAL will be: i) Master Trainers Training ii) Training of Trainers; and iii) VWSC/PGWMC Training.

10. The capacity development activities initiated by the NPMU with the creation of “Master Trainers” at all the participating states. These Master Trainers will be from the States and selected districts based on various Atal Jal components and activities. Master Trainers has been trained by the NPMU on all the components and topics of Atal Bhujal Yojana. The trainings of Master Trainers will be in workshop mode, who will subsequently train the District level experts, concerned DIP staff and also the Line Departments, in addition to the trainings from other institutions on sustainable groundwater management. These Master Trainers will be given regular and refresher training to update their skills and information and are expected to percolate the similar and customised training to the DPMU experts, Government Officers at district level and below and DIP staff on Training of Trainers (ToT) mode.

    1. #### Master Trainers Workshop

11. Training of Master Trainers to be conducted by NPMU in a workshop mode either at National Level or at State Level by bringing all the Master Trainers at same place. The trainees would come prepared with real time data and information from their respective states to practically put together different training modules that they would use in future. The Master Trainers are expected to conduct regular trainings and refresher trainings at district and GP level based on the DLIs and other relevant topics. Besides trainings, exposure visits or cross learning visits shall be undertaken by the states and districts

    for the local villagers, members of VWSC/PGWMC, Sarpanch, Panchayat Secretary, Line Departments and officers and experts of the State, District and DIPs

    2. #### Training of Trainers (TOT)

12. Key activities of ATAL JAL will include compilation of GP level WSPs. WSP is expected to be compiled by members of GP, with technical support from DPMU, facilitated by DIP. The Village Water Sanitation Committee (VWSC)/Participatory Groundwater Management Committee (PGWMC) is expected to possess relevant information, knowledge and skills required to develop and implement the WSP. This is possible only through continuous skill development (training) and handholding. The people responsible for training VWSC/PGWMC and other GP level institutions shall be experts from DPMU and DIP staff. Government and other renowned Training Agencies may also be hired by the states to impart trainings on identified topics at various levels. Government personnel working at the grass-root level such as Agriculture Extension Officers, Junior Engineers, Hydrogeologists etc. are important not  only to give critical data inputs but also play a major role in community capacity building and convergence. Therefore, 3 categories of people viz., DPMU experts, Government Officers at district level and below and DIP staff are considered as primary “Trainers” in ATAL JAL.

13. The responsibility of “Training of Trainers” lies with the SPMU, the Master Trainers created at SPMUs will have expertise to conduct TOT on its own, however, if needed, designated Institutes/Agencies can be appointed to conduct TOT at state level. SPMU can also hire Guest Faculty, if needed for certain themes.

14. Hand-holding refers to essential follow-up visits of technical personnel from DPMU and staff of DIP to see whether VWSC members are able to put into practice newly acquired skills, learnt in training programs. They would need on-field guidance till they become adept in carrying out their tasks aiming at sustainable water management practices. Regular follow up visits may be required as part of hand- holding process.

    3. #### VWSC/ PGWMC/ WMC Training

15. Workshop mode will be used in all the VWSC/PGWMC/ WMC trainings, which will be interactive, using informal	education techniques and material. As in case of TOT, development of Training Modules would ideally start with writing up of Session Guides by a concerned expert in SPMU or Guest Faculty. Training Material required to conduct a particular session should be developed by the concerned expert while she/he is writing up the session guide. Unlike TOT, training material in case of VWSC/PGWMC/ WMC training would be in the local language, based on locally available material and mode of communication.

    4. ## Awareness Creation {#awareness-creation}

16. One of the key aspects of ATAL JAL is to bring in behavioural changes in the community, from the prevailing attitude of consumption to conservation & smart water management. It is imperative that this message is driven across all levels, especially at the grass-root level, so that the objectives of the program  are achieved. Creation of awareness among the general public about the program objectives and to create an enabling environment for program implementation at various levels using various Information, education and communication (IEC) will thus be an important activity under Atal Bhujal Yojana. IEC plays a vital role in influencing the attitudes and behaviour of the people. To make the community informed and aware about Atal Bhujal Yojana is a prerequisite for successful implementation of the program. In order to create awareness about the program, community benefits and their responsibilities for sustainability of the program, a series of regular meetings/workshops are to be organised at various levels.

17. The communication strategy including the messages and the media mix will be designed keeping different target groups in mind, with enough flexibility to address local needs. One of the most critical aspects of IEC strategy is to categorically include ‘Gender Equality’ terminology in all IEC documents. It is of utmost importance to create more women leaders in the decision-making process, hence IEC material should not only make people aware, but also to push gender equality. The states to develop a communication strategy for the entire program period with year wise targets and implement it year wise through Annual Work Plans. The effectiveness of the Communication will be assessed on a regular basis, ideally once a year.

18. The awareness campaign will be undertaken using different media of mass communication, primarily focusing on social media. At the national and state levels, electronic and print media will be the major tools for mass communication. At the district/block level, cable TV, audio visual clips, etc. would be used. The thrust of the campaign would be at the GP level, where communication tools such as nukkad nataks (street plays), audio-visual clips, wall-writing, display boards, pamphlets and cable TV shall be extensively used.

    1. #### National and State Levels

19. At the national and state levels, radio and newspaper will be the tools for mass communication. At the district/block level, cable TV, audio visual clips, etc. would be used. In addition, social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, You Tube, Whatsapp, etc.) which would be linked with the official accounts of DoWR, RD\&GR, Ministry of Jal Shakti and other relevant Ministries / Departments at the Central level shall also be opened and used for awareness creation. Similar arrangements would be done at the State level.

20. A Quarterly  Newsletter could be published during later stages of implementation of the scheme. The newsletter will capture success stories of program implementation across the implementing States;  innovative, low cost techniques / technology for demand and supply side interventions demonstrated by the States, etc.

21. Key messages for communication through newspapers and electronic/print media would be developed by the concerned experts of NPMU/SPMU stressing the water situation (per capita water

    availability / use, sector wise water use, sources of water, etc.), key result areas of Atal Jal, importance of people’s participation, etc.

    2. #### District Level

22. Content developed for electronic media at the State level would be used with necessary modifications for use at district level.

    3. #### Gram Panchayat Level

23. IEC material needed at GP level, based on its time of production, can be divided into two categories viz., those produced before implementation and those produced as part of process documentation during implementation phase. Cable TV is also an effective tool of mass communication at the GP level, of the implementation phase. Short-films, ranging from 1-10 minute duration will be produced by the SPMUs in consultation with the DPMUs and communication experts. Cable TV messages will be more detailed, focusing on issues relevant at the GP level. Broad themes for short-films at GP level could be needed for stress on GP level action, learning from successful experiences in other areas, information on Schemes/ Programs through which linkages and convergence can be facilitated, etc. These short films can also be screened at KVKs, CSCs, etc. The messages should be placed at GP office, post office or at similar places for spreading the awareness about the program.

24. Social media will be used as another tool of information dissemination at GP level focusing on reasons for water stress in the GP and possible action points to address the water scarcity.

25. Street plays / theatre, consisting of folk song-dance-drama sequences, is a very powerful means of mass communication. Local forms of art and popular performing troupes in the area would be identified. The themes for the street theatre would focus on the need for community participation, reasons for water stress in the GP and possible action points to address the water scarcity or any other issue relating to water management, which, in the opinion of SPMU/DPMU merits attention. Local dialects will be the medium of communication. There could be a general script of street theatre at GP level, but the content needs to be changed to make it relevant to the particular GP where the performance is being given.

26. Audio visuals will be produced documenting key activities such as water budgeting and water security plans while they are being implemented at the GP level. Edited Audio-visuals on different themes could be later used in implementation of the program at other GPs. The voice over should be in the local dialect. Main themes of audio-visuals that are to be produced and used during the implementation period should essentially include community data collection, GP water budgeting, GP WSP, supply side interventions, demand side interventions etc.

27. Use of social media platforms is an important way of sharing community generated data/information. Information shared through social media, during the implementation	phase,

    should include items such as daily rainfall data, water level data, result of water budgeting exercise, main components of WSP, lists of less water consuming crops, etc.

28. Information sharing through pamphlets could be a good way of reaching people without access to mobile / smart phones . Information shared in pamphlets could be similar to that of social media Display board is another good medium of sharing information, during implementation phase.

29. Detailed plans for awareness creation at the national level and at the State/district/GP levels shall be developed by the NPMU and SPMUs respectively in consultation with the communication experts to be engaged as one of the first steps in the implementation of the scheme. The progress of various activities shall be monitored regularly through the MIS developed for the scheme.

The NPMU will develop and implement an integrated M\&E system which will be integrated into  MIS and Dashboard to analyse  performance against various Indicators. In addition, the system will also have, on a rolling basis, information on

   1) Fiduciary performance including budget variance, fund flow, timelines of recording actual expenditures and account reconciliations, average duration of procurement processes, number of bidders and bid responsiveness, processing time for contractor payments; the schedule and cost performance of demand- and supply-side investments;

   2) Project/contract management performance and

   3) Convergence with other schemes for implementation of investments in groundwater— number of projects, financial support, and number of GPs covered.

3. The M\&E system will be developed in consultation with the SPMU teams at the state level and will compile information at GP, block, district, line department, and state levels through the MIS developed for the Program. As one of the advance actions, the NPMU shall develop detailed ToR for developing an M\&E system and provide on-site training support for use of the system. Care will be taken to avoid duplication of data collection and feeding into the system. The M\&E system will have the capabilities for geotagging all the activities taken up under Atal Bhujal Yojana.

4. Where M\&E systems already exist, the Atal Bhujal Yojana M\&E system will be interfaced for integration of data and monitoring. All existing M\&E mechanisms, including field equipment and labs, will be used for data collection and feeding into the system. This will encourage improvement of existing systems as well as enable sustainability of the system after scheme life.

5. As part of the initiative an integrated and comprehensive GIS based monitoring and evaluation system has been developed and integrated with the MIS and Dashboard and made operational to enable monitoring the progress and analysis of performance against a variety of indicators. The MIS has been made fully operational for real time / near real time monitoring of various activities specified in the Program Implementation Plan (PIP) and Annual Work Plan (AWP) duly approved by the ministry for all the seven states. The M\&E System is being used broadly for the followings:

* Monitor progress/results (physical and financial);

* Preparation of Water Security Plans at Gram Panchayat Level.

6. The M\&E system also provides an Effective monitoring and evaluation systems aid in the implementation of interim remedial measures and decision-making at all levels of the scheme.

   2. ## DLI Verification {#dli-verification}

5. DLIs will be verified annually by a TPGVA recruited by the DoWR, RD\&GR through the NPMU for measurement of performance of the states with respect to implementation and achievement of DLIs. This will be a third-party sample assessment, which will be carried out on	time to time and a consolidated report will be submitted to the NPMU.

6. The TPGVA report will be reviewed by the NPMU and thereafter forwarded to the World Bank as part of the evidence required to trigger disbursement of loan funds for achievement of the DLIs. Thus, there will be a minimum of six yearly rounds of the assessment during the life of Atal Bhujal Yojana. The first assessment will authenticate and/or update the data available with an established cutoff date for baseline.

7. Each subsequent round of survey will have components that will generate information on the related indicators detailed in the verification protocol. In accordance with good audit practice, verification will take place against a sampling framework and frequency, described in detail in the Verification Protocols Table given in Annexure 1(b).

8. The TPGVA will be responsible for verifying progress against intermediate indicators also throughout the life of the Program.

   3. ## Reporting Processes {#reporting-processes}

9. The DoWR, RD\&GR, through the NPMU, will be responsible for collating data and reports on the status of Program implementation and results achieved. The collected data will be stored and analysed in the M\&E system and provisions for generation of reports will be inbuilt. The DoWR, RD\&GR will take quarterly and/or as required, reviews of the progress of activities at the state levels and will provide feedback to all nodal departments in the states.

10. **Annual Joint reviews.** Annual joint review (including onsite reviews) meeting will be undertaken by the DoWR, RD\&GR and the World Bank to assess program progress, identify and propose remedies for any weaknesses, and propose modalities for scaling up successes.

    4. ## Midterm Review {#midterm-review}

Implementation of WSPs for groundwater management may require land for say drainage line treatment. These small structures such as *nala bund* or check dams will be located on public/government/GP/common land. Hence, land acquisition is not envisaged in the Program.

14. **Rights and interests of indigenous people and vulnerable groups.** The socially vulnerable groups that are severely affected due to depleting quantity of groundwater including small and marginal farmers shall be supported through establishment of water sharing mechanisms that take into account that the limited resources are also  made available to the most vulnerable.

15. ##### **Participation, inclusions, and accountability:**

1) SPMUs/DPMUs shall ensure that the GPs and other community-based institutions such as the water user groups foster the participatory management, planning, and implementation of participatory and community-led methodologies for effective local and regional impacts of the Program. The local-level budgeting and planning will use inclusive and participatory tools to ensure that all sections of the society are included for collective ownership in the WSPs developed.

2) NPMU/SPMUs/DPMUs shall promote feedback mechanism like social audit or other tools to assess its implementation and impact in terms of equity, access, benefit sharing, and accountability.

3) Access to the GRM system under the Program MIS will be widely disseminated for submission of grievances /complaints for redressal.

16. **Fragility and social conflict.** Water dispute management is not expected to be a significant issue with Atal Bhujal Yojana as communication strategy will help in bringing about a collective change in perception about participatory management. In case any issue is raised , the same shall be resolved at the appropriate level by the competent authority, considering the interests of all parties concerned.

    3. #### Institutional responsibility of Social Management

       ##### **National**

       1) Prepare, manage, and build capacities of states on information monitoring systems to track social processes

          2) Provide guidelines for engaging consultants and DIPs at state and district level

          3) Prepare national-level IEC/behaviour change campaigns with guidelines to states on state specific activities

          4) Manage and update capacity development calendar

          5) Develop indicators and reporting mechanisms on social processes

          6) Develop and streamline grievance redressal mechanisms

          7) Coordination with other departments

17. ##### **State**

1) Engage consultants at state and district level for support in management of social processes

2) Carry out capacity development activities

3) Carry out IEC/behaviour	change activities

4) Update MIS on social processes

5) Manage and collate grievances

6) Coordination	with other departments

18. ##### **District**

1) Report to state level on social processes

2) Support the GPs on social processes

3) Manage water-sharing agreements across the GPs

19. ##### **GP**

1) Support local-level planning and implementation committees to carry out the activities for groundwater management

2) Prepare participatory plans

3) Facilitate social inclusion

4) Ensure community monitoring

   4. #### Gender Strategy

20. The goal of Atal Bhujal Yojana is to demonstrate community-led groundwater management through active involvement of communities and other Stakeholders. Keeping in view the implementation of the program in a fair and participatory manner, Atal Bhujal Yojana is committed for equal participation of men and women in the actual implementation of the program at the ground level in all the participating states. Social Safeguards under the program are given prominence, having components of Inclusion, participation, transparency and

    accountability, rights and interests of indigenous people and vulnerable groups, fragility, and social conflict. The potential social risks are exclusion of women socially and economically vulnerable communities from planning, monitoring, and benefit-sharing. Atal Jal shall also include youth and children as the torch bearers.

21. To achieve the target of social inclusion and gender equality, an effective and efficient IEC strategy shall be framed for behavioural change via public awareness in a systematic manner. Customised events and activities to be programmed in such a way to assure gender mainstreaming. Gender-based communication to be placed in \- the content, pictures and language used is gender-neutral, and more inclined towards the women. Male sensitization workshops, target communication and advocacy are few tools which can be used to secure gender equality. Keeping the sanctity of socio-cultural values, separate meetings and training of women should be conducted to ensure gender equity and consequential participation. Fostering female identities and creating local cadre are another gender specific strategy that shall be practiced in all the participating states.

22. The SPMUs/DPMUs shall ensure participation of women in water budgeting and water security planning exercises by mandating the presence of at least 33 percent female members in the GP-level WUAs. Women will be trained on budgeting and planning, as well as monitoring the implementation progress. Additionally, gender issues will be addressed in the meetings of the WUAs. Specific training and exposure visits will be organised to engage women in the project activities. To this effect, the Results Framework of the scheme will track the participation of women in the committee and Panchayat level meetings, the gender disaggregated data on scheme beneficiaries and also the number of women-headed user committees shall be recorded for confirmation of participation of women in the scheme.

    5. #### Governance and Accountability

23. The existing accountability mechanisms under the Right to Information Act and Rights to Services Act will be applicable during the implementation of Atal Bhujal Yojana.

    6. #### Atal Bhujal Yojana Communication Strategy

24. The key objective of the IEC will be to raise awareness about deteriorating groundwater levels and the associated and impending impacts. Importance of the role of participation from all stakeholders, especially end users on the field will be presented. Based on principles of inclusion, transparency, and accountability, the IEC strategy should aim to enhance the ability of stakeholders to engage, influence local-level institutions and hold them accountable for their work.

25. The communications model advocated shall be a community-owned communication strategy that encourages civic engagement, where the community is part of the planning and monitoring process of the schemes. The methodology should be to seek to foster social, political, and institutional changes at different levels by building trust among implementers and the users, promoting a two-way communication, and exchanging knowledge and skills for a sustainable change in both availability of services and behaviour  that is consistent with facts on the ground. The detailed communication plans will be drawn out after an assessment of the communication needs.

    7. #### Operations, Maintenance, and Withdrawal

26. The objective is to ensure that the assets created during the Program implementation phase are sustained and continue to yield benefits in the years to come. NPMU & SPMUs shall play key roles in ensuring that capacities at various levels shall be enhanced to make the program interventions self- sustainable. This will include both training and installation of the systems required to manage, inventory, and plan for maintenance.

Each year, the groundwater level in selected observation wells7 will be measured over the 5-week pre-monsoon period. The observed water levels in each observation well will be corrected for rainfall following a linear regression between rainfall and water levels. For a given block, in a given year, the DLI will be considered achieved if the pre-monsoon groundwater level trend (corrected for rainfall8) in at least 50% of the predefined observation wells is equal to or above the baseline groundwater trend. Blocks can qualify for this DLI in multiple years. |

In blocks of area less than 350 km , at least 6 observations will be required.  
7  
The selection of observation wells and their associated baseline will be finalised in the first 6 months of implementation of the Program in blocks where sufficient number of observation wells are available. Wherever sufficient (minimum 10\) observation wells are not available and new observation wells are to be established with DWLRs for measurements, the baseline will be finalised  in the first 12 months.  
8

Rainfall correction will be based on a simple linear relationship established for each block between rainfall received and the water levels based on previous 5 years’ data. The period for rainfall considered will be from June to December for a given year. Pre-monsoon water levels will be considered. The number of wells used for the relationship shall be representative of the block selected for calculation.

## Annexure I(d) Atal Bhujal Yojana: Incentive Disbursement Guidelines (ADGs) {#annexure-i(d)-atal-bhujal-yojana:-incentive-disbursement-guidelines-(adgs)}

1. #### Introduction

1. Atal Bhujal Yojana is jointly financed by Govt. of India and The World Bank on 50:50 ratio through performance based funding using Program for Results (PforR) financing instrument as it provides a vehicle for incentivizing change at various levels of government and society. By recognizing and incentivizing good performance of States and their implementing agencies, especially Gram Panchayats (GPs), the scheme is expected to provide incentives to innovate and follow-through on priority actions.

2. The key results areas are

1) Strengthened institutional framework and effective groundwater data monitoring and disclosure.

2) Improved planning and implementation of groundwater management interventions.

2. #### Verification of Performance / Achievements

3. The performance/ achievements of the States in respect of the above two results areas shall be verified by the Third Party Government Verification Agency (TPGVA) through the Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) detailed herewith. The verification will essentially be a third party sample survey in all the participating States of the scheme. The TPGVA shall be hired / engaged by DoWR, RD &  GR as agreed with the World Bank and mentioned in the Program Action Plan (Chapter 10 of the Program Guidelines). There will be a minimum of six (6) rounds of verifications, commencing with the baseline survey during 2020-21, followed by a minimum of five annual verifications during the scheme period.

4. TPGVA will operate according to an agreed protocol, which is detailed in Annexure I(b).

5. The annual report containing the verified results will be prepared and submitted by the TPGVA to DoWR, RD\&GR which in turn shall be submitted by the Department to the World Bank for disbursement of funds. Based on the findings of the TPGVA report vis-à-vis requirements for each DLI, World Bank will disburse funds to GOI for onward disbursement to each state.

6. This note outlines the modalities for release of incentives from a) The World Bank to GoI and b) from DoWR, RD &  GR to participating States based on their performance against each Disbursement Linked Indicator (DLI);

3. #### Release of Atal Bhujal Yojana Incentives by World Bank to DoWR, RD \&GR and DoWR , RD & GR to States

   1. #### Resources for Incentive Disbursement Scheme

7. It is envisaged that Atal Bhujal Yojana funds (grants from GoI and loan funds from World Bank shared on a 50:50 ratio) shall flow to the NPMU and to the PIAs in the states from DoWR, RD & GR as grants. The composition of the INR 4,600 crore across DLIs, is presented in table 1(d).1.

**Table 1 (d).1. Proposed DLIs and Financial Allocation**

| DLIs\# | DLI Description | Proposed Allocation (INR in crore) |  |  | % allocation |
| ----- | :---- | ----- | :---: | :---: | ----- |
|  |  | **World Bank** | **Govt. of India** | **Total** |  |
| DLI\#1 | Public disclosure of groundwater data/information and reports | 300 | 160 | 460 | 10 |
| DLI\#2 | Preparation of Community-led Water Security Plans | 450 | 240 | 690 | 15 |
| DLI\#3 | Public financing of approved water security plans through convergence of ongoing/new schemes | 600 | 320 | 920 | 20 |
| DLI\#4 | Adoption of practices for efficient water use | 1200 | 640\* | 1840 | 40 |
| DLI\#5 | Improvement in the rate of decline of groundwater levels | 450 | 240 | 690 | 15 |
| **Total** |  | 3000 | 1600 | 4600 | 100 |

\*Includes the allocations for the blocks having adopted Electricity feeder separation.

2. #### Principles of the Incentive Disbursement Scheme

8. *Key Principles*: The design of the Incentive Disbursement Scheme, is based on:

   1) Measuring and rewarding states for sustained arrest in declining trend of groundwater levels in scheme areas of seven participating states,

   2) Recognizing and rewarding states for institutionalization of standardized bottom-up groundwater planning process in development of water security plans (WSPs);

   3) Allocation of incentive for effective convergence and efficient utilization of local area and multi-sector development funds for implementation of WSPs

   4) Recognizing and apportioning incentives for

      1) Strengthening groundwater management institutions to provide technical assistance to PRIs and community;

      2) Improvement in public disclosure of groundwater information for application by targeted beneficiary community;

   3. #### Allocations across DLIs

9. The allocation of targets against various DLIs has been done in a manner such that States at different levels of performance are accommodated and better performing States will have a chance to earn higher incentives. With this in mind, achievement of each DLI is incentivized differently to allow scaling of rewards on an annual basis.

10. The above DLIs shall be highly beneficial to participating states’ local governments for adopting and institutionalisation of participatory groundwater management. They will also benefit on an incremental basis for taking measures to ensure sustainability of participatory groundwater management initiatives, in addition to data collection, strengthening the water quality testing labs, staffing, training and capacity building of stakeholders on groundwater management.

11. The allocations provided to the states are subject to review and/or reallocation at Mid-term Review (MTR) of the scheme based on the overall performance in implementation of the scheme by each state.

    4. #### Incentives for Performance and Projected Allocations across Years

12. For an incentive disbursement scheme to work successfully, it is imperative that performers are rewarded with adequate resources. Achievement of all DLIs will be subject to verification by the TPGVA. The detailed framework for verification is attached as **Annexure – I(b)** and the data source for verification is **Annexure – I(c)**
