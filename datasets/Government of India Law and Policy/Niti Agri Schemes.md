**MESSAGE**

Agriculture is the lifeblood of this nation. It provides employment and livelihood to crores of

people across the country, and will continue to do so for years to come. Over the decades, the

life of the Indian farmer has changed in many ways, yet stayed the same in even more ways.

Today, we are poised to maximize our export potential, leverage technology to modernize

agribusiness models, extension activities and post-harvest management, and re-adopt

sustainable agricultural practices for future competitiveness.

Though agricultural products are among India’s major exports of primary commodities, India

has the potential to feature amongst the top 5 exporting countries worldwide. Animal

husbandry is growing fast, and ­sheries growth must also be expanded. In order to achieve this,

the country must focus on merging the cutting edge of technological advancement with the

traditional knowledge that is held within so many of our farmers, to increase yield and lower

costs of production while maintaining soil quality. New models of agribusiness are required to

make agriculture a more pro­table and aspirational activity, as the consumption appetite for

healthy, organic, pesticide-free food continues to rise around the world and in India. Linking the

farmers to the market, including through improvements in post-harvest infrastructure and

management, is key. Extension activities must expand to bring new knowledge, access and

connectivity to all the farmers, landed and landless, to improve their productivity, working

conditions and overall wellbeing. The core metrics for performance must further expand from

simply productivity, to accounting for all the positive and negative externalities on the larger

landscape.

In this context, particularly in a fast-changing post-COVID world, questions of climate change

and environmental sustainability attain new signi­cance. In order to be future-ready, Indian

agriculture needs to become more sustainable: water-e‑cient, climate-resilient and grounded

in agro-ecological approaches for future-ready agriculture. This evaluation report is a historic

achievement in capturing the performance of over 30 schemes of the Ministry of Agriculture

and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying under three

umbrellas, and their contribution to the larger agriculture sector. With clear reection on the

strengths and weaknesses of the programmes, along with streamlined suggestions for

improvement, together we can strengthen Indian governance and take our farmers forward

into the 21st century.

**MESSAGE**

NITI Aayog’s mandate is to facilitate transformation in India, and through the Development

Monitoring and Evaluation O‑ce (DMEO), we are working towards institutionalizing

evidence-based policy-making, to strengthen systems of governance in the country. While

evaluations have been carried out in India since the 1950s, this project has been historic in both

its scope and its methods. For the ­rst time, the National Development Agenda has been

divided into ten sectors, with all Centrally Sponsored Schemes in a sector falling under a single

evaluation study. Simultaneously conducting multiple such large-scale studies across sectors

has allowed for rich cross learning, standardization and adoption of leading survey

methodologies and data quality processes. This is evidence generation and implementation

research at the cutting-edge.

However, evidence generation is not enough – uptake must be ensured too. The ­ndings from

this study must now be used to drive reform and future policy initiatives across the Ministries

and Departments within its remit. The study provides data-backed recommendations to

improve government service delivery, at the scheme, Umbrella scheme and sector level. The

Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and

Dairying collects vast amounts of data on outputs like area expansion, productivity, production

etc., but income enhancement of farmers, improved land and water management, enhanced

digitalization across value chain etc. must be measured as outcomes. Ministry o‑cials have

been closely involved throughout the study, via a thorough consultative process, to optimize

the robustness of the study and its recommendations.

In the larger context of the XVth Finance Commission and devolution of funds from the Centre

towards States, these evaluation studies also play an important role in advancing NITI Aayog’s

goal of cooperative federalism. The study examines heterogeneous implementation of CSS and

identi­es sub-national best practices amenable to national scaling up, facilitating learning

among States and with the Centre.

Finally, to make hard evidence the basis of policy decision-making in the country, the

Government of India must itself shift from measuring physical and ­nancial progress, to

measuring outcomes and impacts. This study is a step in that direction, and there remains a

long, promising path ahead.

**Preface**

The Government of India (GoI) spends close to Rs. 10 lakh crore annually on development

activities, through nearly 750 schemes implemented by Union Ministries. Of these 750, 128 are

Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), implying that they are funded jointly by the Centre and the

States, and implemented by the States. Over the years, federalism and the expectations of

government service delivery in India have evolved, and this vast proliferation of schemes is in

sore need of rationalization. Rationalisation of schemes is expected to improve Centre-State

relations, the effectiveness and efficiency of public finance, and the quality of service delivery to

citizens.

To this end, all schemes were mandated to undergo third party evaluations, to provide an

evidentiary foundation to the 15th Finance Commission for scheme continuation from 2021- 22

to 2025-26. The task of conducting these CSS evaluations was granted to NITI Aayog, specifically

to Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO). This volume is thus a part of a historic

exercise undertaken between April 2019 and August 2020, to evaluate 128 CSS, under 28

Umbrella CSS, under 10 Packages or Sectors. The studies together cover close to 30% of the GoI’s

development expenditure, amounting to approximately Rs. 3 lakh crore (USD 43 billion) per

annum.

In order to fulfill this mandate to the highest standard possible, to optimize both the robustness

and the uptake of the evidence generated, DMEO adopted a nationally representative mixed

methods evaluation methodology and a consultative review process for the reports. Altogether,

the project incorporates the direct input of approximately 33,000 individuals, through 17,

household interviews, 7,100 key informant interviews and 1,400 focus group discussions. The

views of Central, State, district, block, ward and village administrations, as well as non-

governmental experts and civil society organizations have been elicited. Through qualitative and

quantitative analysis of secondary literature, validated by this primary data collection, analysis

was done at three levels: the sector, the umbrella CSS and the scheme itself. The key parameters

for analysis, including relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, impact and equity

(REESIE), have been selected based on international best practices in evaluation. In addition,

across 10 packages, certain cross cutting themes have been identified for analysis, including

transparency, sustainability, gender, technology, private sector etc. The reports thus produced

then underwent a consultative review process involving NITI Aayog subject matter divisions,

concerned Ministries and Departments, and external experts. The entire project was

implemented through 10 consultant firm teams selected from the private sector through an open

tender process, managed by small but fiercely dedicated team at DMEO.

Over the course of this project, hundreds of people across the country have pushed themselves

through festivals, monsoon rains, cyclones and a global pandemic, COVID-19, to present these

volumes. DMEO owes a debt of gratitude to each and every one of these contributors, but

especially to all the beneficiaries interviewed, for sharing their precious time and experiences

with our teams. Ultimately, this exercise, as all others by the Government of India, is in service of

the sovereign citizens of this country.

**Acknowledgements**

We would first of all like to express our deepest gratitude to the Ministry of Finance for

recognizing the crucial need for evidence in the deliberations of the 15th Finance Commission,

and entrusting the conduction of these historic evaluations to NITI Aayog. Further, Dr. Rajiv

Kumar, Vice-Chairman NITI Aayog, and Shri Amitabh Kant, Chief Executive Officer, have played a

fundamental role, first in entrusting this weighty responsibility to the Development Monitoring

and Evaluation Office (DMEO) and subsequently as mentors throughout the study, in providing

all necessary support and guidance for the completion of the project.

Our invaluable partners in this exercise have been the Department of Agriculture Cooperation

and Farmer’s Welfare and all its officials, without whose cooperation this evaluation would not

have been possible. Ms. Chhavi Jha, Joint Secretary and various Divisions of the Department also

provided invaluable support. We are grateful to them for providing us access to available data,

for patiently sharing their expertise through Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), and for providing

their vital comments on the draft reports during various stages of the study. A detailed list of Key

Informant Interviews can be found in the annexures to this report.

In the spirit of Centrally Sponsored Schemes in our federal structure, equally important partners

in this endeavor have been the State Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Himachal

Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar

Pradesh and West Bengal, and their Chief Secretaries for providing both ground support and

operational independence to our field partners for the primary study. State Horticulture Offices,

Farmer Societies, Agriculture Extension Officers also provided invaluable support. Officials across

the State governments have extended their gracious cooperation to the study, for which we are

deeply thankful.

Next, we must thank our external experts, Dr. A. K Sikka, Ex-DDG, ICAR, and Dr. Babita Singh,

Overview Contents

**A. Sector Level Analysis**

**A. 1. Background and Performance**

Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of India’s economy, given its vast land resources and

conducive climate. The share of agriculture in the Indian economy was as high as 35% in the 1960s

which has reduced over time with the development in manufacturing and services sector in the

country. In the late 1950’s and early 1960’s the country had been ridden with various issues including

severe food deficiency. Various attempts have been made since independence to implement effective

agricultural policies to improve the production level in agriculture and thus supporting both

producers and consumers. Post-independence, the focus of agricultural policy was on ensuring food

security to battle with crisis like shortage of food and low yield rates. Between 1960 and 1970, the

widespread adoption of rice and wheat was promoted along with an array of supportive initiatives

around production subsidies, minimum support prices, public procurement, storage and distribution

of food grains and trade protection. This had a long standing impact on the overall improvement in

the yield rates and helped the nation achieve self-sufficiency in food grains. As a result of the Green

Revolution, the growth rate in agriculture started improving. The growth in agriculture was recorded

as 0.7% in the period 1960-69 which improved gradually over the following decades to achieve a

growth of 3.88% in the period of 2004- 171. The overarching objective of the sector is maintaining

food security while also ensuring remunerative prices to farmers. A representative illustrative of the

sector’s vision is given below:

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Agriculture and allied sector is

one of the highest contributor to

the country’s economy with a

share of 14.9% in the total Gross

Value Added (GVA^2 ) in 2017- 18

at constant prices. Agriculture is

a primary source of livelihood

for more than 58% of

households in rural India and

provides employment to 43.9%

of country’s total workforce.

Women play an important role in

agriculture during crop

production, post-harvest operations, etc. The share of operational holdings cultivated by women has

increased to 13.9% in 2015-16 from 11.7% in 2005-06. Presently, India is the largest producer of

spices, pulses, milk, tea, cashew, mango, banana and jute, and the second-largest producer of wheat,

rice, fruits and vegetables, sugarcane, cotton and oilseeds. The country is a net exporter of agriculture

and produces more than one billion tonnes of agricultural produce.

The key drivers for growth in the agricultural sector in India can be clustered into the following

heads.

Figure 3: Key Drivers for Growth in the Sector

However, it is important to note that the despite the increase in agricultural production, the overall

contribution of agriculture and allied sector in overall GVA has been consistently declining since

2012 - 13. With reducing economic importance of agriculture, more people are shifting away from

(^2) To estimate GVA for agriculture and allied sector, value of output and material inputs are estimated and then Gross  
Value Added is obtained at constant prices; GVA=Value of output-Value of intermediate consumption (cost of inputs  
or services) at constant prices.

Figure 2: Key Highlights for the Sector

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

agriculture as the total share of employment in agriculture has declined from 51.1% in 2010 to 43.9%

in 2018. One of the primary reasons towards this shift may be attributed to increasing cost of

production and wide gap between farm-gate price and consumer prices, as only a small share of

consumer price reaches farmers.

The average income of agricultural household has been estimated over the recent years through

surveys. In 2012-13, a Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households had been conducted

through the NSSO 70th Round, which estimated the average annual income to be Rs 77,976. In 2016-

17, NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey 2016-17 was further conducted which

revealed about 40% higher income levels in agriculture households during a three year period ending

2015 - 16. It is important to note that while the agricultural household income has shown an

increasing trend, the cost of production has also increased proportionately, making agriculture less

lucrative. Moreover, the estimated average income of agricultural HHs includes income from multiple

sources such as cultivation, livestock, non-farm business, wages and salaries and other govt./ private

activities.

As highlighted earlier, the agricultural export in India constitutes 11.76% of the country’s total

exports in 2018-19. However, the share of export for agricultural sector in total exports has

decreased from 12.66% to 11.76% over the last year. India is a major beef and rice exporter, and a

net exporter of fish, coffee, tea, and spices. However, the country remains a net importer of vegetable

oils, wheat as well as sugar. At the global level, the top 10 exporters represents 72% of the world’s

exports of agricultural products. The highest increase in exports of agricultural products within the

top ten exporters has been recorded by China (9%), Brazil (6%) and Mexico (6%) over the last year.

India’s share of agricultural exports is 2.2% of the world’s agricultural exports as of 2017 and holds

8th position globally. The volume of trade of the top 10 exporters of agricultural products

(country/region) along with their respective share in the world agricultural export as of 2017 is

shown in the following figure.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

In order to reduce the gap between farm-gate prices and consumer prices; and to boost exports in

the sector, there is need to strengthen and add to existing post-harvest infrastructural facilities,

primary processing units, cold storages and distribution facilities. Hence, strategies need to be

formulated to improve agricultural trade including infrastructure creation, enhanced access to

marketing information and reduced food loss. India lacks adequate transportation facilities in the

cold chain infrastructure with only 12% of the total refrigerated capacity in transport infrastructures.

88% of the cold storage capacities are stand-alone infrastructures. An estimated 34 million tonnes of

storage capacity in cold storages (as of March 2017) has been created, but with allied development

of only about 11,000 refrigerated transport units having a capacity of 4 million tonnes only. 7,645

cold storage units have been established in India with a total capacity of 34.95 million tonnes as

estimated in 2016- 173. The distribution of cold storages is highly uneven with majority of the cold

storages located in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar

and Madhya Pradesh. Moreover, 85% of the cold storage capacity is concentrated in these 8 states.

Additionally, it is important to note that the effects of climate change can significantly affect major

crops grown in India. A study on the top grains grown in the country reflects that the national food

supply (which is closely associated with grain production) is sensitive to the effect of climate

variability on monsoon grain production. The research analysed data on yields of five major grain

crops of India (finger millet, maize, pearl millet, sorghum and rice) over 46 years (1966-2011) and

covered 593 of India’s 707 districts^4. The findings revealed yields from rice, India’s main crop

experienced larger declines during extreme weather conditions and reliance on single crop like rice

for food security can make India’s food supply potentially more vulnerable to the effects of varying

climate. On the other hand, yield of other crops included in the study such as millet, sorghum, and

maize were found to be more resilient to the extreme weather. These alternative grains therefore

offer promise for reducing variations in Indian grain production in response to climate shocks, but

avoiding grain production shortfalls from increased alternative grains will require yield

improvements that do not compromise their superior climate resilience. To address the issue, it is

recommended to expand the area under the alternate grains like millet, sorghum, and maize during

the monsoon season. This could potentially offer protection to the country’s grain supply which has

been varying during the episodes of extreme climate such as droughts and storms.

In India, it is critical to enhance the impact of the cooperative sector and create opportunities and

income for marginal farmers as more than 85% of the farmers are small/ marginal. Presently, around

5,000 FPOs (including FPCs) are in existence in the country, which have been formed under various

initiatives of the Govt. of India (including SFAC), State Governments, NABARD and other

organizations over the last 8-10 years. Majority of these FPOs (including FPCs) in India are at a

nascent stage of their operations with shareholder membership ranging from 100 to over 1000

farmers and require not only technical handholding support but also adequate capital and

infrastructure facilities including market linkages for sustaining their business operations. According

to the HH Survey, around 37.5% of farmers are part of a Self Help Group or producer group. Out of

**B. Scheme Level Analysis**

**B. 1. Background**

In 2016-17, several schemes in the agriculture sector were clubbed under one umbrella scheme:

Green Revolution- Krishonnati Yojana. The Umbrella scheme has now been continued for the period

from 2017-18 to 2019-20 with the Central Share of Rs. 33,269.97 crore. The **key objectives of Green**

**Revolution – Krishonnati Yojana** include:

• To create and strengthen the infrastructure for agriculture production

• To reduce the crops production cost

• To market the agriculture and allied produce in efficient manner

**The Umbrella scheme has following 9 Schemes/Missions** :

Apart from the above, the study also includes the Scheme: Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna

(PMKSY) (Per Drop More Crop).

**Implementation Structure and Stakeholders**

The Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare oversees implementation of the

Umbrella scheme. Most of the schemes under Green Revolution are implemented and steered

through the State Agriculture Department on the basis of District Agriculture Plans (DAP) and State

Agriculture Plans (SAP). Dedicated committees and bodies are set up at all the three levels to facilitate

the smooth functioning and implementation of the activities, tracking the progress as per the set

indicators and monitoring the various projects executed in the scheme. At the National level, the

schemes are piloted by either National General/Executive Council or National Advisory Committee,

while at the state level, a state level executive committee or project sanctioning committee is

responsible for approving projects and implementing the scheme. A committee of Project Monitoring

Team (PMT) has been established at the district level in some schemes to monitor on-ground

execution. The Gram Panchayats also oversee projects in some schemes.

Some of the associated stakeholders to the scheme are members from Indian Council of Agricultural

Research (ICAR), State Agriculture Universities, civil institutions and Non-Governmental

organizations, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Small Farmers’

Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC), and Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development

Authority (APEDA). The implementing structure and stakeholders across the major schemes under

Green Revolution has been illustrated below.

**B. 2. Performance of Schemes**

The budgeted estimates for umbrella scheme including PMKSY-PDMC has increased from about Rs.

14,899 crores in 2016-17 to about Rs. 17,908 crores in 2018-19. However, in all the years, the budget

estimates have been reduced by at least 17% in revised estimates.

The trends in Budget Estimates (BE), Revised Estimates (RE) and Actual Estimates (AE) for Umbrella

Scheme of Green Revolution including PMKSY-PDMC (In Rs. Crores)^5 are given below.

As highlighted above, the percentage change in RE from BE has been negative for last 4 years.

Moreover, the full utilization of RE allocations has not been achieved by the Department and there is

scope for improvement.

In 2019-20, the BE has reduced by about 10.32% from that of 2018-19 for umbrella scheme and

PMKSY, which is in contrast to trend in allocation for central sector schemes/ projects. The BE for

key Central Sector Schemes/ projects for DACFW^6 has increased by more than three times from Rs

28,200 crores in 2018-19 to Rs. 1.138 lakh crores in 2019-20. This increase is mainly driven by

budget allocation of Rs 75,000 crores towards Income Support Scheme. In addition to the Income

Support Scheme, the interest subsidy for short term credit to farmers (Rs 18,000 crores) and Crop

Insurance Scheme (Rs 14,000 crores) are other major components of budgeted expenditure for

DACFW.

The agriculture sector in India faces a diverse range of challenges which include increasing

production cost, depleting ground water resources, reducing availability of water, declining soil

quality, scarcity of quality agriculture inputs^7 , low productivity, reducing crop diversity, climate

change, increasing land degradation and most importantly low price realisation to farmers^8. The

interventions under the umbrella scheme of Green Revolution and PMKSY can help in overcoming

these challenges. Therefore, it is critical to give high importance to the umbrella schemes for

achieving sustainable growth.

The performance of the some of the major schemes under Green Revolution have been analysed

**_Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna - Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sector_**

**_Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR)_**

RKVY aims to ensure holistic development of agriculture and allied sectors through creation of

required pre and postharvest agri-infrastructure that increases access to quality inputs, storage,

market facilities etc. and enables farmers to make informed choices. The scheme allows states to

choose their own agriculture and allied sector development activities as per the district/ state

agriculture plan.

In terms of financial performance, the BE, RE and AE for RKVY over the last four years has been

provided below (in Rs Crores).

Figure 8: Estimates and Expenditure for RKVY

Source: Union Budget documents

As it can be seen, the allocations have reduced sharply from 2017-18 onwards. The utilization of the

allocated funds by the Department ranges from 93.6% to 116.7%, with an average utilization of about

104.7% over the last 4 years. Therefore, the scheme has performed extremely well in terms of

utilization of its allocations.

The percentage change in RE from BE has been negative for 3 out of last 4 years and there has been

no change in 2018-19, therefore, the revised estimates have further declined and trend is in-line with

the allocations of funds under the scheme. However, as highlighted above that the RE allocations have

been fully utilized for majority of the times and the scheme has shown satisfactory performance on

financial indicators.

RKVY has been successful in motivating some of the states to pay greater attention to agriculture,

besides providing increased Central assistance for the sector. It may be noted that as per an

independent evaluation of the scheme by Institute of Economic Growth (IEG), comparison of average

household income per acre between beneficiary and non-beneficiary households indicated positive

impact of RKVY on average household income in more than 50% of the states. As per output

allocated under RKVY scheme and about 47% of the total districts are having DAPs and SAPs.

Therefore, there is scope for improvement in performance and maximizing impact of the

interventions being implemented through scheme funds by better engagement with the states.

**_Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna – Per Drop More Crop (PMKSY - PDMC)_**

PMKSY aims to provide protective irrigation to all agriculture farms across the nation to boost farm

output and income. The Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of the scheme focuses on the micro

level storage structures, efficient water conveyance & application, precision irrigation systems,

topping up of input cost beyond MGNREGA permissible limits, secondary storage, water lifting

devices, extension activities, etc.

In terms of financial performance, the BE, RE and AE for PMKSY over the last four years has been

provided below (in Rs Crores).

As it can be seen, the allocations have increased sharply from 2015-16 onwards. The BE in 2018- 19

is 4 times than that of 2015-16. However, there is a difference between BE and RE consistently over

the years. The utilization of the allocated funds by the Department ranges from 94.0% to 179.0%.

Therefore, the scheme has performed satisfactorily in terms of utilization of its allocations.

The percentage change in RE from BE has been negative for last 4 years from 2015-16 to 2018-19,

therefore, the revised estimates have been reduced consistently compared to budgeted allocations

of funds under the scheme. However, as highlighted above that the RE allocations have been fully

Overall the PDMC programme has achieved 82.1% of its overall financial targets from 2015-2019. It

has achieved 100% of its target for micro-irrigation in 2015-16 and 2016-17. In case of

Supplementary Water Management Activities (SWMA), the progress declined sharply in 2018-19 as

compared to 2017 - 18.

PDMC programme has been able to achieve 75% of its physical targets from 2015-2019 while

achieving 100% of its targets in 2015-16 and 2016-17, thereafter the targets were raised

significantly. Though the achievement in 2017-18 and 2018-19 were higher than previous years, the

targets were not achieved. The targeted achievements are however fairly close to targets proposed

in the action plan proposed by DAC&FW^9 in Road map of PMKSY.

From the scheme’s dashboard, it can be observed that post 2017-18, the physical achievement has

not been able to reach the target set. In 2017-18 physical achievement (viz. 11.25 lakh hectare) fell

short of the physical target (viz. 12 lakh hectare). In 2018-19, there was a huge gap between physical

target (viz. 16.0 lakh hectare) and physical achievement (viz. 7.57 lakh hectare). The financial

achievement also declined by 19% of the target set in 2017-18 and by 23% of the target set in 2018-

Considering the importance of the scheme for sustainability, water use efficiency and to address

climate change, it is necessary that the funds allocated under the scheme are optimally utilized and

instances of downward revisions in estimates is in select circumstances. Moreover, there is need to

create a dedicated team at field level to support micro-irrigation efforts and increase adoption among

farmers.

**_Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH)_**

MIDH was rolled out in 2014-15 after subsuming the earlier missions including National Horticulture

Mission (NHM), Horticulture Mission for North East & Himalayan States (HMNEH), National

Horticulture Board (NHB), Coconut Development Board (CDB) and Central Institute for Horticulture

(CIH). The scheme envisages creation of infrastructure for Post-Harvest Management (PHM), Good

Agricultural Prices (GAP), and Centre for Excellence for horticulture and marketing for holistic

growth of horticulture sector.

In terms of financial performance, the BE, RE and AE for MIDH over the last four years has been

provided below (in Rs Crores).

As it can be seen, the allocations reduced in 2016-17 and thereafter have improved sharply in 2017-

18 and 2018-19. The utilization of the allocated funds by the Department ranges from 90.1% to

95.8%, with an average utilization of about 93.5% over the last 4 years. Therefore, the scheme has

performed satisfactorily in terms of utilization of its allocations.

The percentage change in RE from BE has been negative for 3 out of last 4 years and there has been

positive change in 2016-17, therefore, the revised estimates have further declined from the budgeted

allocation of funds under the scheme. However, as highlighted above that there has been over 90%

utilization of RE allocations and the scheme has shown satisfactory performance on financial

indicators.

The scheme has shown substantial progress across most of the parameters and indicates more than

100% achievement of targets for many output indicators, except development of hi-tech nurseries

and FIG formed. The progress on outcome indicators highlight the achievement of key outcomes in

terms of increased acreage and high production.

Therefore, as a result of scheme interventions, significant progress has been made in area expansion

under horticulture crops, resulting in higher production. Moreover, the mission has led to an increase

in productivity and increase in farmers’ incomes, along with increase in horticulture gross cropped

area.

**_National Food Security Mission (NFSM)_**

NFSM aims at increasing production of rice, wheat, pulses and coarse cereals through area expansion

and productivity enhancement in a sustainable manner while restoring soil fertility and productivity

at the individual farm level. The scheme is highly relevant for ensuring food security.

Source: Union Budget documents

As it can be seen, the allocations have increased except for 2018-19 where it saw a slight dip. The

utilization of funds under NFSM has been noteworthy at 102%. However, utilization by states is

significantly less. This is because some states are slow in bringing their matching share of funds, thus

delaying expenditure of funds. The utilization of the allocated funds by the Department ranges from

98.4% to 107.1%. Therefore, the scheme has performed satisfactorily in terms of utilization of its

allocations.

The percentage change in RE from BE has been negative for all of last 4 years, therefore, the revised

estimates have further declined from the budgeted allocation of funds under the scheme. However,

as highlighted above that the RE allocations have been fully utilized and the scheme has shown

satisfactory performance on financial indicators.

The scheme has positively impacted yield and incomes of farmers. The yield for Rice has risen from

2,391 kg/ha in 2014-15 to 2,539 kg/ha (6.2%) in 2017-18. The yield for wheat has increased from

2,750 kg/ha to 3,318 kg/ha (20.7%) in this period, while that for cereals has risen from 1,703 kg/ha

to 1,871 kg/ha (9.9%). As a result of interventions under NFSM, the incomes of beneficiaries have

increased in the range of Rs. 3,764 to Rs. 66,763 depending on the crop^10.

Therefore, the mission has performed satisfactorily, however, performance is not measured for

output and outcome indicators on a yearly basis.

**_Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM)_**

ISAM aims to develop competitive markets and infrastructure for farmers to assist them in better

price realization of their produce. During 2017-18, National Agriculture Market Scheme popularly

known as e-NAM scheme has also been made part of ISAM.

In terms of financial performance, the BE, RE and AE for ISAM over the last four years has been

provided below (in Rs Crores).

Figure 12: Estimates and Expenditure for ISAM

Source: Union Budget documents

As it can be seen, the allocations have shown a fluctuating trend and declined in 2018-19.

Furthermore, significant difference can be noticed every year between BE and RE. The utilization of

the allocated funds by the Department averages around 78%. Therefore, there is scope for

improvement in form of steady allocations, lesser revisions in estimates and better utilization of

funds under the scheme.

The percentage change in RE from BE has been negative for 2 out of last 3 years, therefore, the revised

estimates have reduced consistently compared to budgeted allocations of funds under the scheme.

Moreover, as highlighted above that the RE allocations have not been fully utilized for majority of the

times and the scheme’s performance needs to be improved on the key financial indicators.

While more than 18,000 marketing infrastructure and about 39,000 storage infrastructure have been

created under the scheme; Agmarknet portal has been established which connects more than 3,300

markets; 783 FPOS have been registered and under the National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) project,

585 whole sale regulated markets (APMCs) of 16 States and 02 Union Territories have been

integrated, there are no corresponding targets to assess the physical performance of the scheme.

Considering the highly fragmented markets, lack of marketing and storage infrastructure and lower

utilization of portals such as e-NAM, ISAM needs to make significant progress to address the

marketing gaps in the sector.

**_Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM)_**

SMAM is an important component under NMAET and helps in reducing drudgery of agricultural

worker and enabling farmers to undertake higher production. SMAM was conceived after merging

the central sector schemes on ‘Promotion and Strengthening of Agricultural Mechanisation through

Training, Testing and Demonstration’ and ‘Post Harvest Technology & Management’.

In terms of financial performance, the BE, RE and AE for SMAM over the last four years has been

provided below (in Rs Crores).

Figure 13: Estimates and Expenditure for SMAM

Source: Union Budget documents

As it can be seen, the budgeted allocations have risen sharply over last 4 years. BE tripled in 2017- 18

than that of previous year and then doubled subsequently in 2018-19. The overall fund utilisation

under the scheme in comparison to BE is more than 107% over last 4 years. Between 2014-15 and

2018 - 19, the consolidated RE (Rs 2455.2 crores) and Expenditure (Rs 2614.5 crores) for the years

has been higher than BE (Rs 2343.7 crores). This is an indicator of good scheme progress, sufficient

utilisation and adequate availability of funds. For 2019-20 more than 65% of funds have been utilised

till November which indicates satisfactory progress in utilisation of funds.

The evaluation report by WAPCOS on SMAM highlights the overall positive impact of mechanisation

on farming as it was reported that mechanisation helped in overall increase of 17.9% in productivity

and 14.1% in germination. Mechanisation also helped in saving nearly 1/3rd of the time of operations

30% reduction in labour requirements, 11% reduction in seed rate, 26.6% reduction in weed

instances, 22.4% reduction in diesel consumption and 12.7% reduction in fertiliser requirements.

While the mission has shown progress in financial and physical achievements, NSSO survey and NITI

Aayog reports highlighted the low level of technology adoption as an area of concern^11.

SMAE focuses on awareness creation and enhanced use of appropriate technologies in agriculture &

allied sectors. The schemes components consist of a mix of extensive physical outreach and

enhancement in quality of extension services through inputs from domain experts. The CSS

comprises of Support to State Extension Programme for Extension Reforms (ATMA Scheme).

In terms of financial performance, the allocations, release and expenditure for SMAE over the last

four years has been provided below (in Rs Crores).

Allocation under the scheme have increased over the last 3 years, except in 2018-19 where the

allocation was slightly lower than previous year. The utilization of the allocated funds by the

Department ranges from 93.8% to 111.6%. Therefore, the scheme has performed satisfactorily in

terms of utilization of its allocations.

In the last three years, more than 4.63 crores farmers have been trained, 92,049 trainings have been

carried out under ATMA scheme. About 24,070 exposure visits have been organised for more than 3

lakh farmers, 10,994 farm schools have been established and 23,324 farmer friends are active.

However, except for achievement of targets for number of demonstrations in 2016-17, and Kisan

indicates that while financial targets are being met, there are gaps in meeting physical targets.

**_Rainfed Area Development (RAD)_**

RAD adopts an area based approach for development and conservation of natural resources along

with farming systems. It was formulated on ‘watershed plus framework’ to explore potential

utilization of natural resources developed through watershed development and soil conservation

activities/interventions. It aims to promote integrated farming systems by focusing on multi-

helps in minimizing adverse impact of crop failure through diversified systems.

In terms of financial performance, the allocations and release for RAD over the last four years has

been provided below (in Rs Crores).

Figure 15: Estimates and Expenditure for RAD

Source: Union Budget documents

As it can be observed from the graph above, the utilization under RAD scheme has declined to about

90% in 20 18 - 19. The scheme has a large basket of interventions but majority of funds are spent on

Integrated farming based interventions. Till 2018-19, 90% of funds were spent on integrated farming

based interventions (20.27% horticulture based, 40.84% dairy based, 13.64% small ruminant

poultry based and 2% fisheries based) and 13.33% on cropping systems with peripheral plantations.

It is important to note that large rainfed states such as Rajasthan has not received funds since 2015-

Overall the programme has achieved 75% of its physical targets from 2014-2019. The programme is

declining in terms of percentage of overall physical achievement, which was highest at 89% in 2014-

1.  This has consistently dropped to 69% in 2018-19. One of the primary reasons highlighted for this

decline is the increasing costs for undertaking activities. While the cost required for undertaking

activities has increased in recent years the cost norms under the scheme has remained unchanged,

this affects the performance and leads to non- achievement of targets. In addition, interstate variation

in involvement also affect mission progress.

In terms of output indicators, the scheme has achieved about 75% of its target for “Total area brought

under Integrated Farming System”, about 82% of the target of “Areas where farmers integrated

livestock into cropping system” and about 68% of the training target.

**_Soil Health Card and Soil Health Management (SHC/ SHM)_**

The scheme was introduced to assist State Governments to issue soil health cards to all farmers. SHC

helps in promoting judicious use of fertilizers by providing information on nutrient status of

agricultural soil to farmers. The SHC also contains recommendation on appropriate dosage of

nutrients that for maintaining soil health and fertility

In terms of financial performance, the funds released for SHC and SHM over the last four years has

been provided below (in Rs Crores).

Source: Union Budget documents

As it can be seen from above, the funds released for Soil Health Card have increased gradually over

the years. The funds under Soil Health Management, on the other hand, have shown a fluctuating

trend.

More than 100 million soil health cards have been dispatched in each cycle and the scheme has

progressed well in recent years. The impact evaluation study conducted by MANAGE in 2017

highlighted positive impact by reduction in use of fertilisers among farmers who received SHC. The

recommendation has also helped in encouraging essential micronutrient in cultivation. Moderate

increase in crop yield has also been observed after following soil health card recommendations.

Moreover, the scheme has achieved more than 100% achievement on most of its output and outcome

indicators.

In terms of financial performance, the BE, RE and AE for PKVY over the last four years has been

provided below (in Rs Crores).

Figure 17: Estimates and Expenditure for PKVY

Source: Union Budget documents

As it can be seen, the allocations have shown a consistently increasing trend from 2016-17. However,

there is a significant difference every year between BE and RE. The utilization of the allocated funds

by the Department ranges from 81.4% to 98.1%, with an average utilization of 91.1% in last 4 years.

Therefore, the scheme has performed satisfactorily in terms of utilization of its allocations.

The percentage change in RE from BE has been negative for all of the last 4 years, therefore, the

revised estimates have reduced consistently compared to budgeted allocations of funds under the

scheme. Moreover, as highlighted above that the RE allocations, while utilized at around 90%, have

not been fully utilized and there is scope for further improvement of scheme’s performance on the

key financial indicators.

With respect to physical coverage, a total 5.97 lakh ha area has been covered for 29,859 clusters and

14.93 lakh farmers have been benefitted under PKVY. Moreover, more than three hundred Regional

Councils (RC) have issued nearly six lakh certificates under the PGS – India certification programme.

As per ministry’s physical performance indicators, the scheme has achieved 170% of its total targets

during 2015-16 to 2017-18.

However, the data on outputs and outcomes is not monitored by the department and is not available

even from secondary sources for the scheme.

in seed production, processing, testing etc., to strengthen and modernize infrastructure for seed

production, storage, certification, quality etc.

In terms of financial performance, the BE, RE and AE for SMSP over the last four years has been

provided below (in Rs Crores).

Figure 18: Estimates and Expenditure for SMSP

Source: Union Budget documents

As it can be seen, the allocations have shown a consistently increasing trend from 2016-17. Moreover,

there has been a positive change every year between BE and RE. The utilization of the allocated funds

by the Department ranges from 88.3% to 90.8%. Therefore, the scheme has performed satisfactorily

in terms of utilization of its allocations.

The percentage change in RE from BE has been positive during 2016-17 and 2017-18, therefore, the

revised estimates have increased consistently compared to budgeted allocations of funds under the

scheme. The scheme’s performance on key financial indicators has been satisfactory.

With respect to physical progress, the breeder seed production has increased significantly to 99,671

MT in 2018-19 (against 10,508 MT in 2017- 1 8). However, there has been a decline in production of

foundation seeds. The target of seeds maintained under NSR had been missed in 2016-17 and 2017-

18, but the targets were achieved in 2018-19.

There has been a significant increase in the number of seed villages in 2017-18. It was also

highlighted during the KIIs that more than the targeted 60,000 seed villages have been supported

through the mission. This has also resulted in an increase in number of seeds produced, and the

number of farmers benefitted.

Chapter 1: Sector Level Analysis: Agriculture

1.1 Background of the Sector

Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of India’s economy, given its vast land resources

and conducive climate. In 1960s, the share of agriculture in the Indian economy was as high as

35%^15 which reduced over time with development in manufacturing and services sector in the

country. In the late 1950’s and early 1960’s the country had been ridden with various issues

including severe food deficiency. Various attempts have been made since independence to

implement effective agricultural policies to improve the production level in agriculture and thus

supporting both producers and consumers. Post-independence, the focus of agricultural policy

was on ensuring food security to battle with crisis like shortage of food and extremely low yield

rates. Between 1960 and 1970, the widespread adoption of rice and wheat was promoted along

with an array of supportive initiatives around production subsidies, minimum support prices,

public procurement, storage and distribution of foodgrains and trade protection. This had a long

standing impact on the overall improvement in the yield rates and helped the nation achieve self-

sufficiency in food grains. As a result of the Green Revolution in 1960s, the growth rate in

agriculture started improving. The growth in agriculture was recorded as 0.7% in the period

1960 - 69 which improved gradually over the following decades to achieve a growth of 3.88% in

the period of 2004- 1716. Soon after the green revolution, several production-centric initiatives

were taken to support land reclamation and harvesting of ground water, development at animal

husbandry & fishery sector and give impetus on research and training. A comprehensive National

Agricultural Policy was drafted in 2000 with an endeavor to bring large scale sectoral

development. Progress on the parameters set by the policies led to further growth in the

agriculture and allied sectors.

This section on sector analysis of agriculture covers background on production trends,

contribution of the sector to Gross Value Added (GVA), key growth drivers, exports, and

employment share. It further captures sector performance in terms of production and

productivity, land use patterns, irrigation, storage and processing infrastructure, post-harvest

infrastructure, price-realization by farmers, export trends and social considerations. At the end,

an analysis of major centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) is detailed out, covering the scheme

objectives, components, and Deloitte’s assessment of the impact of these schemes on beneficiary

groups, infrastructure creation/ upgradation, and capacity building, etc. wherever available. A

summary of agriculture sector’s key challenges and strengths along with the most impactful

schemes has been given at the end of this section. A number of previous studies, evaluation

reports, and annual reports were reviewed through the course of the study, including those from

UN Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO), Report on Doubling Farmers’ Income, Economic

Survey, Ministry-level reports, Departmental Annual Reports, other independent evaluation

reports and analysis, among others.

The yield for a majority of crops in India is still lower than the world average. Low irrigation levels,

use of sub-par quality seeds, low adoption of technology, and limited knowledge about improved

agricultural practices. Another oft-discussed issue is maintaining food security in the midst of low

productivity and higher migration of agricultural workers into cities for better incomes,

particularly small and marginal farmers. Infrastructure availability for perishable food items is

another concern that calls for attention.

The overarching objective of the sector is maintaining food security while also ensuring

remunerative prices to farmers. The goal is to modernize agriculture technology to ensure

increase in productivity, efficiency, and crop diversification. Closing the information gap

regarding best irrigation practices (given the region’s topography), latest technologies, and

improved agricultural practices through extension services is required for enhancing production

and productivity. This may be done through Kisan Melas, demonstrations, exposure visits, Krishi

Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), and Farmer Friends, or through Gram Panchayats. The government must

also seek to transform the rural economy through the creation of modern rural infrastructure and

an integrated value chain system. This shall also incorporate promotion of value-added products,

enable diversification to high value crops, and boost country’s exports. All this would call for a

policy environment that enables income security for farmers, whilst maintaining India’s food

security so that farmers are willing to experiment with diversified crops/cropping patterns.

Further, more agripreneurs must be encouraged so that even small and marginal farmers can

capture a higher share of value addition from ‘farmgate to fork’. Private sector participation must

be encouraged in agricultural development to ensure better remuneration and

marketing/distribution of products. Promotion of Research & Development, better marketing

infrastructure, and natural farming shall further contribute to sectoral development. Lastly,

boosting agriculture credit is critical for the sector and thus is one of the key objectives for the

sector.

A representative illustrative of the sector’s vision is given below:

Agriculture Sector Assessment

Agriculture is one of the largest contributors to the economy in India with agriculture, fishing and

forestry having 13. 18 % share in the GDP of the country as of 20 18 - 1917. Agriculture is the primary

source of livelihood for over 58% of households in rural area. Endowed with 15 agro-climatic

zones, ~400 million acres of arable area and 46 to 60 types of soil types, the country has abundant

agricultural produce across the year. In order to address food security concerns, India focused on

maximizing production in agriculture and is currently a net exporter of agriculture with the global

rank of 8^18. India is the largest producer of spices, pulses, milk, tea, cashew, mango, banana and

jute, and the second-largest producer of wheat, rice, fruits and vegetables, sugarcane, cotton and

oilseeds. The overall growth registered in the agriculture sector in terms of percentage increase

year on year has been depicted below.

Figure 25: Growth in agriculture sector in India (%)

Source: Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2018

According to the 4th advance estimates of 2017- 1819 , India produces more than one billion tons of

agricultural produce. Advance estimates for 2017-18 indicate that food grains output reached

28 4.83 million tonnes with pulses at a record 25.23 million tonnes and cereals (rice, wheat, maize,

millets, etc.) at 259.60 million tonnes. Oilseeds production is estimated at 31.31 million tonnes in

2017 - 18 and in horticulture the production has reached 311 million tonnes. Sugarcane, cotton,

Contribution to Employment

As the Indian economy has diversified and grown, agriculture's contribution to GDP has steadily

declined from 1951 to 2018, yet it is still the country's largest employment source and a

significant piece of its overall socio-economic development.

Total share of employment in Agriculture in India has shown a gradual decline from 51.1% in

2010 to 43.2% in 2019 as per latest data estimates from World Bank.

the rapid economic growth in services, increase in industrial output and more focus on non-

agricultural sectors.

Key Drivers for Growth in the Sector

The performance of agriculture, especially growth in the sector, is dependent on a host of factors.

The key drivers for growth in the agricultural sector in India can be clustered into the following

categories –

• **Growing population and growth in income** : Growth in agriculture sector is chiefly driven

by domestic demand. Population growth in India and the rising disposable incomes aligned

with increasing awareness of healthy eating is expected to keep the demand for sustainably-

sourced agricultural products high. According to the analysis drawn in the report Demand &

Supply Projections Towards 2033: Crops, Livestock, Fisheries and Agricultural by NITI Aayog

Working Group^26 , demand for agricultural produce is expected to increase with the

population and the estimates for FY 2029 - 30 have been provided as below.

Projections Towards 2033: Crops, Livestock, Fisheries and Agricultural Inputs Retrieved from  
https://niti.gov.in/documents/working-papers

However apart from increase in population, the demand is also driven by socio-economic

factors that is expected to result in shift in consumption patterns. As per the analysis

provided above, the estimated demand for fruits, vegetables and oilseeds would be the

highest. This would imply a shift in usage of land towards high value crops.

• **Increase in access to farm inputs** : Agricultural productivity depends on availability of farm

inputs such as high quality seeds, fertilizers, and amenities of farm mechanization. Substantial

agricultural surplus can be produced through modernization of farming practices which

would employ improved farm inputs including high level of farm mechanization. Currently

farm mechanization in India is as low as 40%-45% with an available farm power of 2.02

kW/Ha (2016- 17 )^27 ; the current national level of farm mechanization is much lower in

comparison to BRIC countries like China and Brazil^28. With use of modern farm equipment,

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

the farm productivity is estimated to increase by up to 30% and reduce the input cost by

20%^29.

• **Access to credit** : Access to farm credit is an important factor leading to a stable farm produce.

Farm loans for investment purposes are available for irrigation, agricultural mechanization,

land development, plantation, horticulture and post-harvest management. The central Indian

government supports Indian farmers through credit facilities and MSP mechanisms available

for various crops. In FY2018, bank credits to agriculture and allied industries represented

about 40% of the country’s total “priority sector” credit. Currently schemes like Interest

Subvention scheme for institutional credit and PMFBY (Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana)

for crop insurance is being implemented to support small and marginal farmers financially

and ensure consistent production each year.

• **Post production infrastructure and logistic facilities:** Presence and easy access to market

the agricultural produce is a critical driver of growth for agriculture. Product-wise organized

primary market channels enable farmers to monetize their farm output. The infrastructure

required to market the farm produce is availed through the following market avenues:

− Near farm mandis – (for primary assembly and wholesale transaction)

− Near farm farmers market – retail transactions

− Wholesale markets –local, national, APMC (food grains) including eNAM

− Central and State government procurement (food grains)

− Private procurement

Post-production infrastructure in agriculture includes setting up of improved warehouses,

regulated market yards and cold storages. As of 2017, the total warehouse capacity in India is

assessed to be 77.63 million tonnes and an estimated 34 million tonnes of storage capacity in

cold storages has been created.

• **Skilled Human Resource:** In India around 85% of farmers are small and marginal with

fragmented land holdings and practicing primitive subsistence farming. While the

productivity of farm depends on the use of inputs like fertilizer, access to irrigation,

technology, crop intensity and choice of crops (crop pattern) grown at the farm, the farmer’s

access to the knowledge is critical to ensure a consistent production every year. In an

endeavor to improve the agricultural production and the farmer’s knowhow, agricultural

extension is provided to provide research based knowledge for capacity building of farmers

and improve their income. Agricultural Technology Management Agency offers extension

services to farmers by disbursing information, knowledge and skills through awareness

generation, demonstration and thus empowering the farmers and ensuring a self-reliant

farming system in the country.

**(2) Oilseeds**

India is one of the major oilseeds grower and importer of edible oils. India’s vegetable oil economy

is the world’s fourth largest after USA, China & Brazil.

The basket of oilseeds in India comprises of 9 oilseeds which include 7 edible oilseeds (groundnut,

rapeseed & mustard, soybean, sunflower, sesame, safflower and niger) and two non-edible

oilseeds (castor and linseed). Oilseeds cultivation is undertaken across the country in about 27

million hectares mainly on marginal lands, of which 72% is confined to rainfed farming. India is

yet to reach self-sufficiency in the production of oilseeds with per capita availability of vegetable

oil at the rate of 19.5 kg/year/person^31 and has to depend on import of palm oil from Indonesia

and Malaysia. Under the scheme, National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm, strategies have been

taken to increase production and productivity of oilseeds, palm oil, and other treeborne oilseeds

like sal, mahua, simarouba, kokum, olive, karanja, jatropha, neem, jojoba, cheura, wild apricot,

walnut, tung etc. The production of oilseeds has been fluctuating over the given period and grown

at a CAGR of 0.71% between 2011 and 2018 as presented in the graph below.

**(3) Horticulture Crops**

Horticulture comprises a wide array of cultivation systems and is classified in 6 broad categories

namely, pomology (fruits), olericulture (vegetables), floriculture (flowers), plantation crops,

spices, aromatics and herbal medicines. Horticulture is considered as the sunrise sector in

agriculture given its higher monetisable potential relative to field crops like cereals, pulses and

oilseeds. Horticulture contributes more than a third of the agricultural GDP, though it occupies

less than a fifth of the cultivated area and is expected to increase further fuelled by high demand

for fresh fruits and vegetables.

Significant progress has been made in area expansion under horticulture resulting in higher

production. Over the last decade, the area under horticulture grew by about 2.6% per annum and

annual production increased by 4.8%^32. The production of vegetables has increased from 101.2

million tonnes to 184.40 million tonnes since 2004-05 to 2017-18 and 50.9 million tonnes to

97.35 million tonnes since 20 04 - 05 to 2017-18. The growth in horticulture production has been

comparatively consistent over the last few years compared to growth in production of food grains

and oilseeds. Horticulture production has grown at a CAGR of 2.78% between 2011 and 2018.

Figure 49: Horticulture production in India

Horticulture crops production in India has increased from 257.27 million tonnes in 2011-12 to

311.71 million tonnes in 2017-18. Within India, the states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and

Madhya Pradesh were the top horticulture crops producer states in 2017-18. These three states

accounted for more than 30% of total horticulture crops production in India. Among the top

producer states, Uttar Pradesh accounted for 13% of total production in 2017-18, followed by

West Bengal accounting for about 10% of the total production.

**Landholding of Farmers**

The number of operational holdings, i.e. land put to agricultural use, has increased from 13.8

crores in 2010-11 to 14.6 crores in 2015-16 as per the Agriculture Census 2015-16.

The share of marginal holdings (less than 1 hectare) in total operational holdings increased from

62.9% in 2000-01 to 68.5% in 2015-16, while the share of small holdings (1 ha to 2 ha) decreased

from 18.9% to 17.7% during this period. Large holdings (above 4 ha) decreased from 6.5% to

4.3%.

The area operated by the marginal and small farmers increased from 38.9% in 2000-01 to 47.4%

in 2015-16, while large holdings decreased from 37.2% to 20% during this period.

Irrigation

India has improved its performance in bringing agricultural land under irrigation in the last

decade. The gross irrigated area in the country increased by 13% between 2006-07 and 2014- 15

and irrigation intensity expressed as the ratio of gross irrigated area (GIA) to gross cropped area

(GCA), increased by 9% as reported in the report Doubling Farmers’ Income – Volume I.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Between 2006-07 and 2014-15, area brought under irrigation in Madhya Pradesh alone was 3.5

million hectares, followed by Rajasthan (2.2 million ha), and Uttar Pradesh (1.5 million ha). A total

of 10788 hectares of gross cropped area has been brought under irrigation. Out of a total of

197852 thousand hectares (as of 2014-15), a total of 94825 thousand hectares is gross irrigated

area. The top 10 states with the highest percentage of gross cropped area under irrigation are

featured in the graph below.

**Micro Irrigation**

In an attempt to improve production efficiency in agriculture and enhance the output, strategies

for implementing Micro Irrigation have been taken in India. Micro Irrigation enhances water use

efficiency through appropriate technological interventions like drip & sprinkler irrigation

systems and encourage the farmers to use water saving and conservation technologies.

As per estimates of micro irrigation data, out of the total potential area of 42.24 million hectares,

only 18% is under micro-irrigation. The area under drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation for the

top 10 states has been shown in the graph below.

Centrally Sponsored Schemes for Micro Irrigation, National Mission on Micro-Irrigation is being

implemented to increase water use efficiency and crop productivity especially in states with low

rainfall. Under this scheme, the reduction in resource cost and productivity enhancement has

been assessed state-wise. The irrigation cost reduced by 20-50 per cent with an average of 32.3

per cent. Saving of fertilizers with average reduction of about 28 per cent in total fertilizer

consumption was reported in the surveyed states along with 30% energy consumption savings.

Gains in productivity registered an increase in average productivity of fruits and vegetables by

42.3%.

After adoption of micro irrigation systems, the states of Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat are

enjoying both high energy consumption savings as well as fertiliser consumption savings.^34

Infrastructure

Agriculture production in India is focused on incremental growth and providing input for further

growth in food and beverage manufacturing industry in the country. Being one of the largest

global agricultural producer, India has potential to improve its food processing industry with

substantial agriculture surplus production, storage and cold chain infrastructure, modernized

post-harvest facilities and government support. India’s food and beverage industry was the fifth-

largest sector in manufacturing, and the leader in terms of employment generation in FY2017.

The sector is expected to attract private investment post the approval of 100% FDI in food trading

for food manufactured in India.

There is need to strengthen and add to the existing post-harvest infrastructural facilities, primary

processing units, cold storages and distribution facilities. Hence the strategies undertaken to

improve agricultural trade includes infrastructure creation, enhanced access to marketing

information and reduced food loss.

**Warehousing and Cold Storages**

Warehousing and cold storages are the primary post-production infrastructure for holding

surplus stock for extended duration. Under the Warehousing Development & Regulatory

Authority (WDRA), warehouses managed by Food Corporation of India (FCI), Central

Warehousing Corporation, State Marketing Federations, State Civil Supplies Corporation are

registered. In 2018- 19 , a total storage capacity of 162.71 million tonnes was available for food

grains including cereals and pulses.

Procurement of food grains for the Central Pool is done through Food Corporation of India and

State agencies through Minimum Support Price as declared in the given year by Government of

India. The stock position of food grains under Central Pool as of 2016-17 was 380.04 lakh MT

which included rice (297.84 lakh MT), wheat (80.59 lakh MT), pulse (1.47 lakh MT) and coarse

grains (1.61 lakh MT).

Cold chain infrastructure is one of the most critical component for handling the agricultural

produce, especially the perishable goods to store and connect to the market. Cold-chain ensures

that fresh whole produce reaches gainful end-use and thus reduces food loss. Cold chain

infrastructure is a logistic chain that includes cold storages or refrigerated warehousing

integrated with refrigerated transportation. India lacks adequate transportation facilities in the

cold chain infrastructure with only 12% of the total refrigerated capacity in transport

infrastructures. 88% of the cold storage capacities are stand-alone infrastructures. An estimated

34 million tonnes of storage capacity in cold storages (as of March 2017) has been created, but

with allied development of only about 11,000 refrigerated transport units having a capacity of 4

million tonnes only. The transport units are exclusively as trucks, as there are no multi-modal

reefer containers for domestic use (rail shipment) of temperature sensitive fresh produce or

processed products.

The gap in the cold chain infrastructure in India had been assessed in All India Cold-chain

Infrastructure Capacity study by National Centre for Cold-chain Development (NCCD) conducted

in 2015. The infrastructural gap found in the study is as follows:

Currently there are 7,645 cold storage units in India with a total capacity of 34.95 million tonnes

as estimated in 2016-17.^35 The distribution of cold storages is highly uneven with majority of the

cold storages located in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana,

Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. 85% of the cold storage capacity is concentrated in these 8 states. The

**Food Losses or Post-harvest losses**

Food losses or post-harvest losses are primarily caused by failure in the handling and connecting

of food produced to consumption points or markets. The food loss that post-harvest and before

connecting to markets, is effectively a loss of saleable volume and value, and is an economic

burden on the food supply system. In addition, the perishable agricultural products which are

high nutritious food and high value crops are more susceptible to the loss. The post-harvest losses

in India had been evaluated in 2015 by a study^37 commissioned by MoFPI to CIPHET. As per their

estimates, the total food loss in agricultural products which include food grains, fruits and

vegetables ranges between 3.08% and 15.88%. The agricultural commodity wise post-harvest

losses estimated in India are depicted in the table below.

Moreover, analysis of food loss conducted by SFAC in North Eastern states shows that the food

loss is in the range of 9% (potato) to 32% (peas)^38 , implying states with poor connectivity and

infrastructure are even more vulnerable to post harvest losses. In another study done in 2015 by

NCCD, losses in horticulture produce had been estimated across activities from farm to whole-

sale markets located mostly in North India. The findings reveal the range of post-harvest losses

varies from 7% (watermelon) to 44% (pears). The losses in the agricultural produce were

assessed across its journey from the farm to the market. The stages of measurement of the loss

were:

− At farm-gate (point of harvest)

− At collection point (aggregation)

− On loading onto transport

− During transportation

− On receiving at wholesale point

According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the global food loss

and waste^39 incurred amounts to 1.3 billion tonnes (2011)^40. Fruits and vegetables have the

highest food loss and waste of 44%, followed by roots and tubers (20%) and cereals (19%).

According to the FAO report, HLPE, 2014, food losses and waste in the context of sustainable food

systems, in South and South East Asia 28% of the agricultural produce is lost or wasted, out of

which 21% is attributed to losses during harvest, post-harvest and processing. The reduction of

the crop losses can be ensured by improving the market linkage which includes logistics,

transportation, warehousing facilities and cold storages. As per the Economic Survey 2018-19,

India’s global position in food loss is 70^41 with a score of 86.4 as against the average global score

of 84.9.

Price Realization

**Price realization by farmers**

As assessed by the Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Household, NSSO, 2015, the share

of a producer in each rupee paid by the consumer is found to be as lowest in the case of fruits and

vegetables^42. The price realization of farmers across various key commodities have been assessed

in the report and compared with price realization of different agencies such as the mandi, input

dealers, cooperatives and government agencies, processors in an endeavor to improve farmers’

share in consumer price. The table below gives the price realization by farmers in kharif and rabi

crops of 2012-13.

Farmer’s share in the price of the agricultural produce to the final consumer is found to be very

low due to the inefficiencies of the marketing system. A detailed analysis of price realizations to

farmers, expressed as share in consumer rupee across a wider variety of commodities reveal that

pulses and fruits & vegetables have the lowest realization. While farmers share in pulses range

between 46-56%, for most fruits (aonla, apple, kinnow, litchi, mango, banana, pineapple,

pomegranate, sapota, sweet orange), it is as low as 26% to 67%. Among all fruits, banana is most

profitable to trade as its price realization range between 82% - 85% in most of the markets.

Efficient marketing system is ensured by operational ease and price efficiencies in the market

channels of various agricultural produce. Reducing farm gate price dispersion through creation

of improved physical infrastructure have enabled better monetization of farm produce by

farmers. The extent of price dispersion at farm gate, across multiple markets in the country is thus

considered as a measure for marketing efficiency.

According to the NSSO Situation Assessment Survey of Agriculture Households Round 70, price

dispersion for specific crops had been studied across states on the basis of 2013 prices. The table

below quantifies the price wedges between farm-gate prices to the final consumer prices in which

the biggest price wedges are for

potatoes, onions and

groundnuts. The wedges are

lower for rice, wheat for which

there are a large number of

farmers and is supported by

Minimum Support Price. The

price wedges for pulses is in the

mid-range. As analyzed in the

Economic Survey 2015 - 16,

perishability of agricultural

products was inferred as an

important factor driving price

wedges.

Change in Agricultural Prices

As observed in the household (HH) survey, the price of paddy (per kg) and wheat (per kg) has

increased by 19.6 9 % and 17.8 1 % between 2015-16 and 2018- 19 respectively as realized by

**Change in Income of Producers**

The average annual income of agricultural household comes from components like cultivation,

livestock, non-farm business, and wages and salaries. The average income of agricultural

households is estimated with representations from marginal and small (owning land size of less

than 2 hectares), medium and semi-medium (owning land size in the range of 2 to 10 hectares)

and large farmers (owning land size of more than 10 hectares) according to the sizes of the

landholdings owned by them. The income for the small and marginal farmers is comprised of a

larger share of wages and salaries while for large farmers, a major share of the income comes

from cultivation.

The average income of agricultural household has been estimated over the recent years through

surveys. In 2012-13, a Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households had been

conducted through the NSSO 70th Round, which estimated the average annual income to be Rs

77,976. In 2016-17, NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey 2016-17 was further

conducted which revealed about 40% higher income levels in agriculture households during a

three year period ending 2015-16 as compared with the estimates by NSSO Situation Assessment

Survey, 70th round for the year 2012-13.

**Discussion on cross-sectional thematic areas**

i. Accountability and Transparency

The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is apex institution for

providing assistance to all activities around agriculture, livestock and fisheries with its

constituent Departments of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare assisting in agriculture

related activities. The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare coordinates

with the State Governments assisting them with the continuous progress in agricultural

production across the country. The Directorate of Economics & Statistics, an attached office of

DAC&FW is responsible for providing important statistics on area, production, cost and yield of

principal crops, minimum support prices, to implement schemes related to improvement of

agricultural statistics, and carrying out agro-economic research. The production of major crops in

the country are released in 4 Advanced Estimates followed by Final Estimates available State-wise

and at the national level for the 28 identified crops including pulses.

In agriculture sector, 15 schemes are identified for DBT implementation, out of which around 10

centrally sponsored schemes are linked to the DBT portal to ensure transparent delivery of

financial assistance to beneficiaries including individual farmers, entrepreneurs, and State

Governments. The Management Information System of these schemes is linked with Central

Agriculture Portal (dbtdacfw.gov.in).

The details of the scheme-wise DBT fund transfers in 2018-19 are given in the table below:

ii. Direct/indirect employment generation

Shortage of agricultural labour in the sector has emerged as one of major challenge for the

agriculture sector. The workforce engaged in agriculture sector was pegged at 228.3 million in

2011 - 12 out of a total workforce in the country of 467 million, having the highest share of workers

in the country^47. However, the trend of workers engaged in agriculture has been decreasing over

the years not just as a share in total employment but also in absolute numbers employed in the

sector.

(^47) FICCI, KPMG. 2015. Labour in Indian Agriculture: A Growing Challenge.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Figure 88: Trend of Workers Share in Agriculture Sector in India

The trend of declining workers share in agriculture depicts the growing problem of agriculture

labour shortage with fewer people being added to the sector and many of the workers migrating

to other remunerative sectors. It has been observed that around 2 million people were added to

the workforce since 2004-05 compared to around 12 million people that were added to the

workforce every year as an average between 1999-00 and 2004-05.

A state-wise analysis of agriculture labour productivity suggests that around 80% of the reduction

in agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 is attributed to the reduction in agriculture workers

in five states, namely Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Bihar and Rajasthan.

Source: FICCI, KPMG. 2015. Labour in Indian Agriculture: A Growing Challenge

The graph shown above depicts that most of the agrarian states in the country experienced the

drop in agriculture labour force during 2004-05 to 2011-12, with Uttar Pradesh having the

maximum decline by 28% followed by states like Karnataka (15%), West Bengal (12%), Bihar

(12%) and Rajasthan (12%). Some of the top reasons causing labour attrition is because

agriculture is less profitable than other occupations available in the secondary and tertiary

sectors and there is preference for a permanent/ regular job compared to agriculture which is a

seasonal occupation. The shift in rural employment under the primary sector has decreased from

71% and 64% while the employment in secondary sector gained from 15% to 20% between the

period 2004-05 and 2011- 1248.

Certain crops production which requires significant amount of labour hours per unit of area

cultivated are also affected by scarcity of labour. Crops such as paddy, wheat, cotton sugarcane

and groundnut are among the most likely to be affected by labour scarcity. As per the analysis of

the FICCI-KPMG Study on Labour in Indian Agriculture, the states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra,

Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal have substantial coverage under the

labour intensive crops and consequently have higher propensity to face labour challenges in the

near future.

In 2012-13, the number of agricultural households in India was pegged at 90.2 million which

constituted around 57.8% of the total estimated rural households of the country.^49

Among the major States, Rajasthan had highest percentage of agricultural households (78.4%)

among its rural households followed by Uttar Pradesh (74.8%) and Madhya Pradesh (70.8 %).

The principal source of income for the agricultural households has also been analysed and it

reveals that agricultural households mainly depend on cultivation followed by wage/ salaried

employment. The figure below shows the various sources of principal income for the agricultural

households in the country as of 2012-13.

Out of all agriculture based employment, cultivation has the highest share, with 63% of

agriculture households depending on cultivation for their principal income generation and 4% of

the agricultural households depending on livestock rearing for the same. When the classification

of agricultural household’s principal income generation is assessed according to their

landholdings, it is found that households with larger landholdings are likely to be more dependent

on cultivation.

iii. Gender Mainstreaming

Agriculture provides employment to the adult males as well as the adult females of a household.

Women have a critical role in cultivation and have been engaged in production of major grains

and millets, in land preparation, seed selection and seedling production, sowing, applying

manure, weeding, transplanting, threshing, winnowing and harvesting.

Source: https://icar-ciwa.org.in/gks/index.php/information-and-statistics-section/90-gender-participation

Globally, the rate of participation of women in agriculture has been pegged at 42% as of 2010,

where as in India over 60% of women are engaged in agriculture^50. The overall worker

participation rate amongst women in India is only 25.5%, whereas the same among men is 53.9%

(refer table given alongside). There has been no improvement in the worker participation rate

amongst women between 2001 and 2011. In agriculture sector, share of women cultivators

amongst total cultivators have decreased from 32.3% (2001) to 30.3% (2011). Women

agricultural labourers have also decreased from 46.6% (2001) to 42.7% (2011) as seen from the

table above. It is also observed that the share of women in total agricultural workers which

continuously increased during last 50 years to 39% in 2001 declined to about 37% in 2011^51.

With the trend of agriculture accommodating lesser number of women workers in the future, it is

important to take up suitable technological and policy initiatives for increasing the involvement

of the women workers in agriculture.

Female in the agriculture group represents a crucial demographic group. Rural women form the

most productive work force in the economy for a majority of the nations, including India. Women

in rural families can be considered as ‘farmers’ in some sense, working as agricultural labourers,

unpaid workers in the family farm enterprises or combination of the two^52. Women are mostly

engaged in labour intensive work such as seed preparation for sowing, raising nurseries for

seedlings, thinning, sowing, transplanting, weeding, preparation of fertilizers as well as

application of fertilizer, in gap filling, winnowing, grading, shifting produce to threshing floor,

cleaning and processing the grain etc. As of 2019, 56.5% of women vis-à-vis 39.5% men are

engaged in agriculture, as highlighted in the figure below.

The above indicates an increased participation of women in the management and operation of

agricultural lands.

The growing inequity among the women engaged in agriculture is riddled with various issues.

The problems faced by the women at the farm are^53 :

*   Lack of Extension Services: Extension services seem to be biased towards men who are  
    recognized as the owner of farms and pass on the extension information to women in the  
    households. This often results in depriving women who are engaged as agricultural  
    workers from obtaining key knowledge of improved farming practices.
*   Land Ownership: Lack of ownership of land/ access to land for women continues to be  
    major obstacle to increasing their contribution and benefits.
*   Overburden: Women are often involved in labour intensive, monotonous, repetitive and  
    drudgery prone work, which are carried out manually, leading to mental and physical  
    exhaustion and occupational health hazards.

*   Limited Access to Resources: Having no direct ownership of land, women face constraint  
    of money and other resources required for cultivation. Women have limited access to  
    markets as well. The current transport and marketing facilities also are not inclusive of  
    the needs of the women farmers and traders.
*   Migration of Men: Migration of spouses to cities to earn a living have led to increase in  
    responsibilities for women in the rural agricultural households.
*   Socio-Economic Status: It is observed that women’s share of work in agriculture is  
    greatest among small farmers. Women in landless households spend twice as much time  
    working for wages in agriculture than women in families with land.
*   Lack of Education: Due to illiteracy, women are forced to work as unskilled labourers. One  
    of the studies showed that agricultural productivity increased with increase in primary  
    education of at least 4 years.^54

Incorporation of gender perspective in policies, plan, programmes and projects can effectively

bring gender equity in farming. Some of the strategies that can help in mainstreaming women in

agriculture are as follows:

*   Collation of gender based data and understand the requirement of women farmers to  
    design women friendly farm equipment
*   Sensitization of extension workers to include women farmers
*   Training should be made available to women in the use of technologies
*   Sensitizing public, private agencies, policy makers, planners on the gender perspective  
    in environmental and developmental issues
*   Planning at the local panchayat level should be gender-sensitive and should have  
    gender/sex-segregated information

As observed in the HH survey, out of all workers engaged in agricultural activities as self-

employed or paid workers, 31 % are women. The analysis of male and female workers engaged in

agricultural activities as self-employed workers or paid workers at farm households has been

given in the graph below.

Box 1 : Strengthening women farmers’ role in sugarcane value chain

Case Study: Strengthening women farmers’ role in sugarcane value chain

Introduction:

Globally, India is the second largest sugarcane producer, contributing to about 10% of its agricultural

GDP (Solomon, S. 2016. Sugarcane Production and Development of Sugar Industry in India. Sugar Tech.,

18(6)). Female employment in agriculture in 2018 stood at 55.38% (ILOSTAT database, September

2018). According to the 2011 census, the agriculture sector employs nearly 98 million women, with

about 63% of them serving as agricultural laborers (DownToEarth, Defeminisation of Indian agriculture,

8 March 2018). Yet, their contribution remains undervalued – especially in sectors such as sugarcane

farming, which are perceived to be male-dominated.

Challenge:

DCM Shriram Limited is one of India’s largest business conglomerates, with a strong focus on

agribusiness in rural India. Much of its sugarcane produce comes from Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, one of the

poorest, most patriarchal, and most disadvantaged districts in the country, with 66% of its population

living below the poverty line. Hardoi has an agriculture-based economy, with sugarcane as the main cash

crop.

Although women actively participate in the sugarcane value chain, their work and contribution are often

overlooked. Women’s work is labor-intensive and frequently concentrated at the very start of the value-

chain, such as in weeding or planting. Sugarcane farming is often perceived to be a male-dominated

activity--so training and programs that allow farmers to increase their yield and income are often not

targeted at women. Male farmers typically have assets registered in their name, resulting in the exclusion

of women farmers or farmers’ wives from accessing credit, markets, or becoming members of farmers’

networks. Women also tend to have limited economic access both within their community and outside

because of restrictive social norms and care responsibilities toward the well-being of elders, children,

livestock, and other assets.

Solution:

Under the Meetha-Sona-Unnati program, DCM Shriram and IFC, in collaboration with Solidaridad

Network Asia and Coca-Cola India, developed an approach to build the capacity of farmers, to increase

agricultural yield and conserve water and soil health. DCM Shriram and IFC developed specific solutions

to increase the visibility of the work done by women farmers and their impact on improving farm yields:

• DCM Shriram and IFC identified key operations where women laborers and farmers are the

dominant workforce on ground. The project applied the Women’s Empowerment Agriculture

Index, an innovative measurement tool to diagnose areas of disempowerment of women in

agriculture and design development programs to address those areas. This assessment marked a

significant shift from earlier gender-blind analysis and enabled the project team to create targeted

trainings for women farmers on improving their skills and knowledge.

• Based on the findings of the baseline on women’s roles and crop yield barriers, the project team

hired a female trainer to hold training sessions for women on mechanization, entrepreneurship,

and financial literacy. To address low participation, wider outreach and convenience, especially for

women farmers, the team brought in a mobile van to deliver the trainings closer to farmers’ homes.

• This effort was further complemented by focus group discussions with women in the villages, to

strengthen their role and participation in the sugarcane value chain.

Impact:

• Trainings for more than 1,000 women in the classroom and mobile vans on Good Agri Water

Management Practices (GAWMP) have led to an increased yield (of 25 percent) in the DCM Shriram

production catchments.

• The yield increase translated into increased income for the farmers, often doubling their existing

income.

• The trainings encouraged women to take on larger and less labor-intensive roles in the agricultural

value chain (such as, learning how to operate farm machinery).

• Some sessions were conducted for both women and men together. Such trainings demonstrated

how they could work together despite the gender-segregated culture.

• DCM Shriram and IFC along with other key partners are now exploring how to enable more than

10,000 women farmers in the sugarcane growing region to participate in dairy farming, as an

additional income generating activity.

iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient

practices & diversifications

Climate change is a threat to agriculture productivity and could impact livelihood and income of

farmers. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), approximately a

quarter of all anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide are caused by agriculture, forestry and

land use changes. Nearly 80% of poor population of the world who lives in rural areas and

typically rely on agriculture, forestry and fisheries for their survival are affected.^55 The severity of

climate change is likely to increase in future and there could be drop in crop yields by 10 to 25

percent by 2050 in the face of climate change.

(^55) FAO. 2019. Agriculture and climate change. Retrieved from [http://www.fao.org/climate-change/en/](http://www.fao.org/climate-change/en/)

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Effects of climate change can significantly affect major crops grown in India. A study^56 on the top

grains grown in the country reflects that the national food supply (which is closely associated

with grain production) is sensitive to the effect of climate variability on monsoon grain

production. The research analysed data on yields of five major grain crops of India (finger millet,

maize, pearl millet, sorghum and rice) over 46 years (1966-2011) and covering 593 of India’s 707

districts. The findings revealed yields from rice, India’s main crop experienced larger declines

during extreme weather conditions and reliance on single crop like rice for food security can make

India’s food supply potentially more vulnerable to the effects of varying climate. On the other

hand, yield of other crops included in the study such as millet, sorghum, and maize were found to

be more resilient to the extreme weather. These alternative grains therefore offer promise for

reducing variations in Indian grain production in response to climate shocks, but avoiding grain

production shortfalls from increased alternative grains will require yield improvements that do

not compromise their superior climate resilience. To address the issue, it is recommended to

expand the area under the alternate grains like millet, sorghum, and maize during the monsoon

season. This could potentially offer protection to the country’s grain supply which has been

varying during the episodes of extreme climate such as droughts and storms.

According to estimates of ICAR studies, yields of irrigated rice is projected to decrease by about

4% in 2020, 7% in 2050 and 10% in 208 057. Climate change is projected to reduce timely-sown

irrigated wheat production by about 6% in 2020. In case of late sown wheat, however, the

projected reductions are to the extent of 18, 23 and 25 percent in 2020, 2050 and 2080

respectively. Rainfed sorghum yields are projected to decline marginally (2.5%) in 2020 scenario

and by about 8% in 2050.

In order to combat the impacts of climate change on agriculture, Government through Indian

Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has initiated a network project on ‘National Initiative on

Climate Resilient Agriculture’ (NICRA) to enhance resilience of Indian agriculture through

Strategic Research on adaptation and mitigation (covering crops, livestock, fisheries and natural

resource management), Technology Demonstration, Capacity Building and

Sponsored/Competitive Grant Projects. The Centrally Sponsored Scheme, National Mission on

Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) aims at promoting sustainable agriculture through a series of

adaptation measures focusing on ten key dimensions encompassing Indian agriculture namely;

‘Improved crop seeds, livestock and fish cultures’, ‘Water Use Efficiency’, ‘Pest Management’,

‘Improved Farm Practices’, ‘Nutrient Management’, ‘Agricultural insurance’, ‘Credit support’,

‘Markets’, ‘Access to Information’ and ‘Livelihood diversification’. NMSA caters to key dimensions

of ‘Water use efficiency’, ‘Nutrient Management’ and ‘Livelihood diversification’ through adoption

of sustainable development pathway by progressively shifting to environmental friendly

technologies, adoption of energy efficient equipment, conservation of natural resources,

integrated farming, etc.

As analysed in the Doubling Farmer’s Income Report, profiling of vulnerable districts across the

country has been made by linking climate vulnerability with farmers’ income. The vulnerability

of agriculture to climate change at district level is drawn from three components such as

Exposure, Sensitivity and Adaptive Capacity of the districts^58. The same has been set against the

poorest districts with lowest income status of farmers coming from crop sector as per NSSO-SAS

(^56) Davis. 2019. Sensitivity of grain yields to historical climate variability in India. Published by Environmental

survey, 2013. Low income reduces the adaptive capacity of the farmers to withstand climate

shocks and thus increases the risk of the small and marginal farmers further to the adversities of

climate change effects. The identified Double stressed Districts in terms of Climate Vulnerability

and Low Farm Income are given in the table below:

Source: Doubling Farmers Income Report, Volume I

These 28 districts are highly vulnerable and disadvantaged in terms of double stress created from

low farm income as well as high climate vulnerability. These districts require priority attention in

terms of area specific policy formulation as well as implementation to enhance income of farmers,

thereby thus raising their adaptive capacity and reducing vulnerability of agriculture to climate

change in these areas.

Among these identified double stressed districts, the land holdings of farmers are on the lower

side with most farmers being small and marginal farmers. Also, the number of people depending

on non-farm income are in minority in these states, thus the majority of people in all these states

are largely dependent on agriculture. In these climate sensitive states, the percentage of gross

irrigated area to total cropped area is less than 50% making these areas prone to rainfall

fluctuations. It is also observed that the area under horticultural crops is also quite low in all these

states. All these states are also marked by high population and low literacy level in rural areas. It

is recommended to design programmes to ensure higher growth in these districts. Technological

programs supported by agricultural science centres like ICAR, SAUs, KVKs etc. can mentor these

districts in association with state governments.

The HH Survey has analysed the practice around soil conservation among agricultural farmers.

The graph below shows the findings.

As observed from the graph above, only around 26% of farmers practice soil conservation. The

various practices of soil conservation have been also analysed and presented in the following

of farmers practice soil conservation techniques like soil or stone bunds, 31% of farmers practice

techniques like fencing and 17% of farmers opt for planting trees to prevent soil erosion. Around

17 % of farmers use drainage ditches for soil conservation.

Another important aspect with respect to sustainability of operations relates to practice of

irrigation at critical stages for reaping maximum benefits. Some of the critical stages of irrigation

includes tillering, crown root initiation, booting, heading and flowering, blooming and seed

formation among others. As observed from the graph above, around 75% of farmers practice

irrigation at critical stages of farming which is a healthy indicator.

**_Crop Diversity_**

Diversification of crops helps in mitigating risks of price shocks and production losses. However,

the agricultural systems in India have become increasingly reliant on rice and wheat impacting

crop diversity. The crop diversification index in India has also fallen down from 0.907 in 2011- 12

to 0.899^59 in 2015-16. A comparison between the total cropped area between 1985-86 to 20 13 -

14 suggests that the increase in non-food crop (44%) was much higher than the increase in food

crops (10%). This is seen as the case of technology led diversification which led to reduction in

area of coarse cereals, oilseeds and pulses^60. Furthermore, the Economic surveys of India as well

as Doubling farmers’ income reports have highlighted the need for improving crop diversification

in country to improve, soil health, productivity and resilience of crops.

Multiple schemes by Government of India as well as state governments are trying to encourage

crop diversification. NFSM which is one of the major schemes, targets increased production of

pulses, coarse cereals, nutri-cereals and oil seeds along with rice and wheat to ensure food

security in India. Interventions under NFSM have targeted increase in area under pulses through

distribution of quality seeds, field demonstrations, promotion of micronutrients and creation of

seed hubs. However, the scheme suffers from inadequate staff strength at field level for

implementation as well as delay in disbursal of funds at state level. Promotion of coarse and nutri-

cereals is an important component which requires increased attention. MIDH is another scheme

which is promoting diversification through promotion of activities for increase in horticulture

production and value chain development. The scheme has been successful in increasing

horticulture area but is facing challenges in getting quality planting material, marketing of

produce, delayed funding and variation in performance among states. Also, RAD is giving

precedence to promotion of Integrated Farming Systems. However, majority of interventions are

for promotion of dairy based integrated farming. In addition, RKVY has also supported

interventions to shift area from paddy to alternate crops in Punjab, Haryana and Western UP^61. In

view of the above, there is need to provide more focus on interventions that aim to encourage

diversification of crops.

**_Water Use Efficiency_**

Indian agriculture is primarily rain-fed, Government of India is putting thrust on scaling up of

irrigation projects through its various schemes. But variation in rainfall and depleting ground

water level poses challenge to agriculture; especially when the cropping systems are becoming

more resource intensive with focus on rice, wheat and sugarcane. To push for increasing water-

use efficiency, major schemes such as PMKSY and M IDH, are promoting micro-irrigation

through drip and sprinklers. However, the scale of these schemes is limited for required

interventions. As can be seen that the progress of PMKSY-PDMC is limited largely to six states and

mostly concentrated in southern and western region of the country. Penetration of these schemes

for promoting drip irrigation in northern, eastern and central India remains limited. In addition,

the impact from adoption of micro-irrigation systems is not being evaluated at field level, which

can assist in bringing in efficiency and effectiveness. Also, the soil resource mapping and

classifications are also not being utilised uniformly across all schemes in planning and proposing

intervention areas.

Box 2 : Floating Gardens - Climate smart agriculture production system in Bangladesh

Case Study: Floating Gardens - Climate smart agriculture production system in Bangladesh

Introduction:

Evidence of climate change in Bangladesh can be seen in an accumulation of heavy rains, frequent

storms and rising sea levels that result in severe flooding. Due to continuous water-logged conditions,

crops are often lost and land for agriculture has become scarce. The low-lying areas of the southern

coastal – and southcentral – districts of Bangladesh remain submerged for 6–8 month periods every

year, especially during the monsoon season. As a result, crop cultivation is not possible on land.

Solution:

A 2015 FAO study in Bangladesh revealed an innovative location-specific adaptation to climate change

for improving the food security of the nation’s vulnerable people. In the low-lands of Bangladesh, some

farmers have converted the prolonged flooding season into an opportunity: “floating gardens”. These

are floating plots made from local organic material on which diversified vegetables are grown or

seedlings are raised for marketing.

In this system, farmers prepare the rectangular-shaped beds during June and July and sow/transplant

seeds eight to ten days after the last stacking to the garden bed. Around 30 species of vegetables, spices

and other crops or seedlings are grown in this water-based production system. The major vegetable

crops are okra, ribbed gourd, Indian spinach, brinjal, cucumber, red amaranth, stem amaranth, wax

gourd and (in winter) turnip, papaya, cabbage, cauliflower, tomato and red amaranth. The spices,

turmeric and chili are also grown. Mixed intercropping is the most prevalent system.

Recycling is an important component of this production system. Garden beds are made from local

organic material (plants) that are almost free, recyclable and do not pollute. When the floodwater

recedes, decomposed beds are used as compost on the ground to grow winter crops.

(^61) Demand supply projections towards, 2033, crops livestock and Agricultural Inputs, NITI aayog, 2018

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Impact:

• The FAO study found that farmers operating the floating gardens system received an average gross

return of USD 265 and a net return of USD 134 per season. In comparison, when cropping on plain

land, farmers received an average gross return of USD 31 and a net return of USD 10. The floating

gardens production system clearly increases the farmers’ incomes and is more profitable than

vegetable cultivation on plain land.

• The floating gardens led to a reduction of vulnerability to income of farmers in areas with heavy

rainfall.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the

scheme in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

The share of socially disadvantaged groups among agricultural households in India have been

given in the chart below.

Figure 97: Table showing distribution of SC, ST, and OBC among Agricultural Households

Distribution of agricultural households by social group for each decile class of monthly per capita

consumer expenditure (MPCE) reveals the economic status of the socially backward group in the

country. According to the table given below, the bottom three decile classes had higher

representation of ST and SC agricultural households compared to their shares in the all classes

defined by MPCE. The percentages of SC and ST agricultural households in the top two deciles are

very low. It can be observed that percentage share of ST agricultural households sharply declined

from about 31 % in the lowest class to little more than 6 % in the highest class. Among the SC

agricultural households, percentage share of SC households is around 20% in the first six classes

(except the 5th class) and near about 15 % in the next three classes.

The similar picture is reflected in the distribution of agricultural households by social groups over

different size classes of land holdings.

Figure 98: Distribution of agricultural households by social groups

Source: NSS KI (70/33): Key Indicators of Situation of Agricultural Households in India

As it can be seen from the graph above that the percentage share of ST agricultural households

increased from the lowest size class of land possessed and reached its maximum in the 4th size

class (1.01-2.00 hectare) and then gradually decreased to its lowest level at the highest size class.

The percentage share of SC agricultural households decreased gradually from 28 percent in the

lowest size class to about 3 percent in the highest size class of land possessed.

The findings depicted above implies that there is a persisting economic disparity across different

disadvantaged social groups. Farmers belonging to the castes and communities that are located

on the lower rungs of the social hierarchy–henceforth the ‘socially-marginalized castes’–are found

to have limited access to the factors of agricultural production, which could further result in lower

farm income.^62 These socially marginalized classes often remain excluded from benefiting from

rural development programs. The exclusion of the marginalized social groups from access to

agricultural resources have led to reduction in farm productivity as well as household income

potential of the marginalized communities. According to a study^63 based on NSSO Survey of Key

Indicators of Situation of Agricultural Households in India, it has been observed that economic

inequalities among farm households of various social groups in rural India emerge largely from

caste inequalities in ownership and access to means of production and technology. Farmers of the

socially-marginalized castes are economically-disadvantaged due to three factors: (1) inferior

resource endowment status, (2) exclusion from public extension networks, and (3) and regional

differences in the quality of extension services and infrastructure.

To address the issue of disparities among the socially disadvantaged groups in India and support

them in their livelihoods associated with agriculture, it is important to analyse the inter-caste

inequities among farm households of various social groups given there is a dearth of information

on inter-caste differences in the quality of production resources managed by the farm households,

which might also contribute to the lower marginal returns to extension services. Policies and

agricultural extension services focusing on ecosystem, health and natural resource conservation

alongside improving yield rates is relevant for marginalized farm households.

Analysis of HH Survey reveals the beneficiary percentage among all disadvantaged groups^64 as

part of Green Revolution scheme. The graph below shows the findings.

Figure 99: Beneficiary Percentage: All Disadvantaged Groups vs Others

Source: HH Survey, Deloitte Analysis

As observed from the graph above, among all agricultural farmers from all disadvantaged groups,

around 83% of farmers are Green Revolution scheme beneficiaries. Among agricultural farmers

from other social groups^65 , around 92% farmers are Green Revolution scheme beneficiaries.

Further analysis of the HH Survey brings out the participation of all disadvantaged groups in Self

Help Groups or Producer Groups.

vi. Use of IT/Technology in driving efficiency

Information technology has been a major driving force for growth in business sectors. In a similar

way, IT can also influence growth in agriculture by addressing issues around poor access to

markets and financial services, low levels of human and physical capital, poor access to education

and weak information flows. With application of ICT, transaction costs can be brought down,

market reforms and market intelligence can be improved thus increasing efficiency of the food

value chain. The digital technology can promote efficiency and inclusion alongside, catering to the

needs of the socio-economically marginalized population.

Information and Communication Technology can contribute in agriculture sector by providing

accurate information on weather, inputs, markets, and prices; by feeding information into

research and development initiatives; by disseminating knowledge to farmers; by connecting

producers and consumers, and through many other avenues^67. The role of ICT in agriculture can

cater to the following areas^68 :

*   Agricultural extension and advisory services by bridging information gap between  
    agricultural researchers, extension agents and farmers
*   Promote environmentally sustainable farming practices by improving access to climate  
    change solutions
*   Disaster management & early warning system by providing actionable information to  
    communities on disaster prevention in real time
*   Enhanced market access for inputs as well as product marketing

One of application of ICT in agriculture in India aimed at improving market access for all farmers

is e-NAM, a pan-India electronic trading platform, which was launched by the government in

1.  The portal has been designed to create a transparent and competitive price discovery

system to help farmers get remunerative prices for their produce. There are 585 wholesale

regulated markets of 16 States and 02 Union Territories (UTs) who have been integrated with e-

NAM platform. As on 30.06.2019, more than 1.64 crore farmers & more than 1.24 Lakhs traders

have registered on e-NAM platform.^69

Figure 101: Table showing Farmer Registration and Farmer Benefitted under e-NAM portal

As it can be seem from above, the use of the portal has been high in states like Andhra Pradesh,

Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telengana and Uttar Pradesh. Since there are nearly 26.31

crore workers engaged in the farm sector^70 , eNAM is yet to reach to the majority of farmers.

Agricultural marketing system can be further strengthened by introducing market intelligence

collating relevant information on the future demand, price and production scenario which would

benefit the farmers greatly in minimizing their risk and augment their income. This necessitates

a framework for precise forecasting of agricultural prices, supply and demand, by developing

proper mechanisms for collection, compilation, analysis of the appropriate data and the

dissemination of the information. Currently in India some project mode interventions are being

conducted for forecasting and projections of different crops.

1.  National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) has been implementing the  
    project to forecast prices of key commodities for short and medium term using Auto  
    Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling to monthly wholesale price  
    index. Price forecast covers 17 commodities and sub-groups namely rice, wheat, jowar,  
    bajra, maize, pulses, gram, tur, onion, potato, groundnut seeds, rapeseed & mustard,  
    soyabean, edible oil, and food products.

1.  Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has been implementing a network project  
    on market intelligence by creating the grid of Agricultural Market Intelligence Centres in  
    India. The aim of this project is to help farmers in taking sowing and marketing decisions  
    based on scientific information and to get better prices for their produce ultimately. Two  
    types of price forecasts on agriculture commodities were generated and disseminated.  
    ‘Pre-sowing forecasts’ are released to help farmers on sowing and area allocation  
    decisions and ‘pre-harvest-forecast’ to take decisions on whether to sell the produce  
    immediately or store for some period for price advantage in the future. The intervention  
    included 34 mandatory crops and the required data was collected from regulated markets  
    identified in each state to represent the crop. The price forecasts generated were validated  
    by interacting with traders, farmers, other commodity specific websites and also in  
    futures platform. The adoption of market advisory has led to higher income among traders  
    than non-adopters.

The use of technology to create commodity reports thus helped in knowledge sharing and

information dissemination among beneficiary farmers. Farmers could understand the current

knowledge on market information and market intelligence, access current source of market

demand and generate better revenue from their produce. However, forecasting of commodity

prices and demand is not under the purview of any department, in spite of several ongoing

interventions involved in compilation, monitoring and release of prices/price indices by

various organizations. Implementation of market intelligence in the country would require

robust data collection mechanism for crop forecasting. Information on harvested quantity,

demand of commodities along with projections is required to be evaluated. Engagement of

private IT sector can add value to the endeavour of establishing market intelligence system.

Box 3 : Grading agriculture produce through artificial intelligence to boost farmer income

Case Study: Grading agriculture produce through artificial intelligence to boost farmer income

Introduction/Challenge:

Standardization and grading are the first steps in the value-chain of an agricultural produce as it travels

in a market channel to the consumer. Variations in quality of agricultural produce has led to

incommensurate prices for farmers. The assessment of produce quality depends on a responsive

system of grading and standardization, which can be quite subjective in absence of a good grading

mechanism.

Every consumer wants high quality fruits and vegetables, which are not over-ripe, discoloured, or

damaged. The process of quality testing is done manually, with inspectors physically checking a sample

from every lot. This makes the testing subjective, allowing errors to creep in.

Solution:

Bengaluru-based start-up Intello Labs set out to provide advanced image recognition technology that

can recognize objects, flora, fauna and tag them in any image. The company uses deep learning

algorithms on which a new generation of intelligent applications are built for applications in

agriculture.

Intello’s AI can generate instantaneous quality metrics based on a photo taken on a basic smart phone.

This enables Agricultural Product Grading, which entails automated quality analysis of images of food

products, which is an accurate and reliable method for grading fresh products (fruits, grains,

vegetables, cotton etc.) characterized by color, size and shape. Its tools help in bringing transparency

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

and standardization to quality assessment, reducing value risk and wastage in the agriculture supply

chains. It has developed a ready-to-use solution for fruits, vegetables and spices.

Impact:

• The company claims that its image analytics and AI testing can give B2B players savings of between

three and five percent.

• Standardisation and digitisation of produce can go a long way in making e-Mandis and digital agri

markets successful.

vii. Development, dissemination & adoption of innovative practices, technology & know-

how

Agriculture in India is practiced across different climatic zones and to increase the productivity

of the agricultural commodities an entire range of innovative cultivation technology is applied.

Various technological innovations have been developed in order to adapt to the local needs,

optimally use the naturally available resources and cater to the needs of the changing market

demand. In the wake of climate change and rising stress on all natural resources, sustainable

growth in agriculture can be only ensured through constant improvisation of production

processes. Climate smart agricultural technologies can sustainably improve production, resilience

of production systems, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to ensure food security.

Precision farming increases agricultural productivity while decreasing production cost and

minimizing environmental impacts. Precision agriculture is based on information technology,

which enables the producer to collect information and data for better decision making. This

system of farming includes application of Global Position System (GPS) in the agriculture fields,

close monitoring of crop, soil and climate information and finally analysis of the data to

understand the accurate agricultural inputs required for optimum and sustainable output.

However in India, most farmers are small and marginal farmers with small field size, making

precision farming an unviable option. The small size of farms and fields in most of Indian

agriculture limits economic gains from currently available precision farming technology, but

other factors in Indian agriculture such as concerns for the environment, food safety and need to

increase productivity stresses on immense potential and benefits of precision agriculture.

In India precision farming is yet to evolve and practiced by most farmers. However, some of the

early adoptions of the practice show desirable results. The Tamil Nadu Precision Farming Project

was implemented over three years (2004-2007) in the districts of Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri in

the northern part of Tamil Nadu.^71 The project focused on increasing the yield of horticulture

crops in areas which were considered to be backward, impoverished and water-scarce dominated

by traditional agricultural practices. The precision farming technology inputs applied to the

project were drip irrigation using Class 3 fertigation units along with water soluble fertilizers

(WSF), the use of community nurseries, use of remote sensing technologies to develop a

fertigation schedule according to crop and soil type, grading and sorting techniques and detailed

documentation of farm activities. The impact of the farming showed evidences of increased yield

and also increased level of income.

Currently Precision Farming Development Centres (PFDCs) have been established in India to

promote “Precision Farming & Plasticulture Applications for hi-tech horticulture” and located in

State Agricultural Universities (SAUs); ICAR Institutes such as IARI, New Delhi; CIAE, Bhopal &

CISH, Lucknow and IIT, Kharagpur^72. National Committee on Plasticulture Applications in

Horticulture (NCPAH) conducts the adoption of precision farming practices in horticulture

through various trials, demonstrations and extension programs. There are around 22 such PFDC

have been operating to promote various plasticulture applications in horticulture. Plasticulture is

one of the precision farming practices which uses plastics in agriculture and horticulture for

moisture conservation, water saving, reduction in fertilizer consumption, precision in application

of nutrients as well use of innovative packaging solutions help in increasing shelf-life and during

collection, storage & transportation of fruits and vegetables.

Practices around Micro Irrigation in India have been discussed earlier in the section on Irrigation.

Appropriate technology interventions like drip & sprinkler irrigation systems are being promoted

across the country under the scheme Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna- Per Drop More Crop.

However the current coverage of micro irrigation has only reached 10.25 million hectares^73 which

constitutes 15% of the total potential area of 69 million hectares^74. The coverage of micro

irrigation has been presented for the top 10 states in the graph below.

Currently, the practice is taken up widely in the water stressed states. However, agrarian states

like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal have much lower achievement in micro irrigation. The

same is also observed in the hilly states like Himachal Pradesh and states of the North East.

Difficulty in constructing drip and sprinkler irrigation is one of the main challenges behind the

poor performance despite having additional financial support from micro irrigation schemes like

PMKSY –Per Drop More Crop.

In India, Tata Kisan Kendra (an initiative under Tata Chemicals) applied technological innovations

to support the conventional farming system (i.e. tilling the soil to prepare for planting, and heavy

reliance on chemical inputs, such as pesticides and fertilizers). Use of remote sensing technology

to analyze soil, inform about crop health, pest attacks and coverage of various crops predicting

the final output are put into practice to reap healthier crops, higher yields and enhanced incomes

for farmers. Trainings are imparted from the centers to farmers through workshops and

screening of films related to good practices. The crop clinics under Tata Kisan Kendra (TKK)

access information from the geographic information system (GIS) and advise farmers on what to

grow, where and when to grow it, and how much urea and nutrients to use. At the soil-testing

laboratory, technicians analyze soil samples to determine their composition and confirm what the

satellite maps have indicated. Additionally, the TKK network operates experimental farms where

scientists conduct agricultural research and development. Tata Kisan Kendra has been replicated

successfully in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab.

As observed in HH Survey, around 76% of farmers have awareness about soil health and around

38 % of farmers own soil health card. The findings have been displayed in the graph below.

Box 4 : Use of predictive analytics in agriculture

Case Study: Use of predictive analytics in agriculture

Introduction/Challenge:

Typically, farmers in India use age-old methods to predict the right sowing date for their crops. While

these methods had worked well in the past, the changing weather patterns in the past decade have led

to unpredictable monsoons, causing poor crop yields. This impacted farmers’ incomes and increased

their vulnerabilities, causing many to commit suicides as they could not repay their loans on time.

Solution:

Microsoft partnered with International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and

Andhra Pradesh government to develop the Sowing App, a mobile application that uses predictive

analytics to advise Indian farmers on the best time to sow crops, depending on weather conditions,

soil, and other key indicators. The app aims to reduce failures and increase yield by arming farmers

with information helpful in making critical decisions.

To calculate the crop-sowing period, historic climate data spanning over 30 years, from 1986 to 2015

in Andhra Pradesh was analyzed using AI. To determine the optimal sowing period, the Moisture

Adequacy Index (MAI) was calculated. MAI is the standardized measure used for assessing the degree

of adequacy of rainfall and soil moisture to meet the potential water requirement of crops. The real-

time MAI is calculated from the daily rainfall recorded and reported by the Andhra Pradesh State

Development Planning Society. The future MAI is calculated from weather forecasting models for the

area provided by USA-based aWhere Inc. This data is then downscaled to build predictability, and

guide farmers to pick the ideal sowing week.

Sowing advisories are then initiated and disseminated until the harvesting is complete. The advisories

contain essential information including the optimal sowing date, soil test based fertilizer application,

farm yard manure application, seed treatment, optimum sowing depth, and more. In tandem with the

app, a personalized village advisory dashboard provides important insights into soil health,

recommended fertilizer, and seven-day weather forecasts.

Impact:

In 2017, the program touched more than 3,000 farmers across the states of Andhra Pradesh and

Karnataka during the Kharif crop cycle (rainy season) for a host of crops including groundnut, ragi,

maize, rice and cotton, among others. The increase in yield ranged from 10% to 30% across crops.

**_viii. Stakeholder & Beneficiary Behavioural Change_**

Agriculture sector is India is deterred by the problems of low yield in the agricultural produce

which mostly stems from the lack of knowledge among farmers and poor access to good quality

inputs. The recent study assessing the conditions of farmers called “State of Indian Farmers” by

Centre for Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) throws light on the prevailing practices and

problems faced by the farmers. The study included more than 5000 samples from 137 districts of

the country in 2014. As per the findings, around 76% of the farmers wanted to give up farming.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Farmers reported issues of repeated losses in farming and have been affected by unseasonal rains,

droughts, floods and pest attacks.

Good Agricultural Practices in India are being promoted under the certification called INDGAP^75

which is being implemented by the Quality Council of India. In line with the recommendation of

World Trade Organization, INDGAP incorporates concepts of globally accepted Good Agricultural

Practices (GAP) within the framework of commercial agricultural production for long term

improvement and sustainability. INDGAP takes into account not only the quality and quantity of

the produce obtained from a unit area but also care is taken in integrating pre-harvest practices

like soil & water management, nutrient management and pest management, harvesting, post-

harvest handling and other logistics. The areas around good agricultural practices focused under

the scheme INDGAP aims to cater to the following aspects^76 :

• quality and quantity of the produce obtained from a unit area

• various aspects of food safety

• pre and post-harvest practices including workers health and safety

• sustained supply of produce of the desirable quality

Development of the voluntary sustainability standard such as INDGAP focuses on the adoption of

certification by small and marginal farmers under the accreditation of National Accreditation

Board for Certification Bodies under the scheme component INDGAP Basic^77.

In the global scenario of certified agriculture and good agricultural practices, International Trade

Center provides insights into the progress on the widely accepted sustainability standards for

select agricultural products (namely bananas, cocoa, coffee, cotton, oil palm, soybeans, sugarcane,

tea, and forestry products). Complying with the United Nations 2030 Agenda, the voluntary

sustainable standards have been set to address the issue of unsustainable consumption and

production as flagged under United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12. The report “State

of Sustainable Markets 2019”^78 uncovers the expansion in sustainably certified agricultural and

forestry commodities. Two of the 14 voluntary sustainability standards discussed in the

aforementioned report, Global G.A.P and Organic have been considered to discuss the progress of

India in comparison to the top performers across the globe.

Global G.A.P. or the Global Partnership for Good Agricultural Practices includes 40 standards set

for entire agro food sector that covers food safety, environmental aspects, as well as worker

health and safety. It covers crops, livestock and aquaculture production and also ensures product

segregation and traceability of certified products. The top countries with highest certified area

under Global GAP has been depicted in the graph below.

Under the Good Agricultural Practices in India, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is practiced

among farmers to keep pest population at below economic threshold levels by employing all

available alternate pest control methods, especially bio-pesticides and pesticides of plant-origin

like Neem formulations. Chemical fertilizers are used as last resort. This technique has helped to

control the indiscriminate and unilateral use of pesticides and contain ill effects like human and

animal health hazards, ecological imbalance, development of resistance in the pests to pesticides,

pests resurgence and environmental pollution. Under the Sub Mission on Plant Protection and

Plant Quarantine introduced in 2014-15, strengthening and modernization of Pest Management

Approach in India is being promoted and IPM is being popularized through training and

demonstration in crops inter-alia promotion of biological control approaches in crop protection

technology. Several Central Integrated Pest Management Centres^80 (31 Centers) have been setup

for pest/disease monitoring, production and release of bio-control agents/ bio-pesticides,

conservation of bio-control agents by imparting training to Agriculture / Horticulture Extension

Officers and farmers at Grass Root Level by organizing Farmers Field Schools (FFSs) in farmers’

fields.

The 31 Central Integrated Pest Management Centers (CIPMCs) located in 28 States and one Union

Territory undertakes the programme with following activities:

• Surveillance & Monitoring of insect-pest & diseases.

• Augmentation and Conservation of Natural enemies.

(IPM) and practices around it. The graph below depicts the awareness and practice among

agricultural farmers.

It can be observed from the graphs above that around 56.6% of agricultural farmers are aware of

Integrated Pest Management. However, 47 % of farmers have been practicing Integrated Pest

Management in their farms.

**Low adoption of technology and recommendations**

Concerns have been raised in NSSO surveys about the reach of the extension services and level of

technology adoption. Similarly, a study on level of adoption of Drip irrigation in Tamil Nadu

highlighted that the level of adoption of drip irrigation has been low among small and marginal

farmers, as it has high initial costs and requires regular maintenance. It was also highlighted that

the large farmers are more likely to shift to drip irrigation as they can afford the initial costs and

know its benefits in optimising the water use and reduction in labour costs^81. It was also observed

during the field surveys and KIIs that adoption of micro-irrigation is more in water scarce areas

where farmers intend to grow water intensive agricultural and horticultural crops. Therefore,

while the adoption of micro-irrigation may help in efficient use of water it may not prevent loss

of ground water, and the micro-irrigation activities needs to be supported by interventions for

ground water recharge.

In addition, the need for a scientific approach by providing customized input recommendations

specific and suitable to crops, weather and soil fertility as well as advice on financial viability of

crops and marketing trends has been observed. Soil health card is one such initiative that can be

helpful in transforming agriculture but is facing infrastructural and implementation challenges

leading to reluctance in adoption of recommendation of SHC. Apart from soil health card other

aspects such as crop specific use of pesticides, integrated pest management, advisory on weather

fluctuations, disease control, water use, etc. are not adequately covered in current set of schemes.

In addition, the knowledge about market related information and existing trends is very poor

among farmers, because of which many suffer losses even when the production is good. Farmers

need to be provided customized solutions which include recommendations on productivity and

marketing of produce.

**Lack of remunerative prices and MSPs impact on production**

It is important to note that despite the increase in agricultural production, the contribution of

agriculture and allied sector in overall GVA has been consistently declining since 2012-13. This

diminishing trend is a concern, as agriculture still is the primary source of livelihood for more

than 58% HHs in rural India and provides employment to 43.9% of country’s total workforce. One

of the primary reasons towards this reduction may be attributed to increasing cost of production

and wide gap between farm-gate price and consumer prices, as only a small share of consumer

price reaches farmers. The prices further slump during the peak arrival season when there is good

production. Therefore, procurement made by the government at MSP of select crops ensures that

the farmers get a better value for their produce, moreover, if procurement is done at right time it

prevents the prices of the commodity to fall below MSP level and help in stabilising the prices.

That is why, the farmers prefer to go for crops which are more likely to be procured by the

government at MSP. MSP is more appealing as many state governments also announce bonuses

on top of the MSP which make growing of these crops a better proposition. However, both central

and state agencies only procure select crops at MSP and majority of state and central level

procurement are for rice and wheat, so farmers prefer to grow rice or wheat as the risks are

limited. Therefore, in order promote crop diversification the immediate need is to improve the

marketing and storage facilities for alternative crops. Reforms in marketing and risk management

are crucial to change the mind-set of farmers to make more investments in alternative crops

especially in rainfed regions^82.

**Making extension activities more effective**

The increasing cost of production and wide gap between farm-gate price and consumer prices has

called for increased focus of government towards making agriculture more remunerative.

Agriculture extension plays a key role in facilitating the same. While the state agricultural

department and schemes such as SMAE, MIDH, etc. are trying to promote good practices among

farmers, they face constraints in terms of availability of extension workers and resources. One of

the flagship initiative under SAME is ATMA which is seen as a good programme, however, has not

been effectively implemented. The report of the Committee on Doubling Farmers Income

highlighted that capacity building of extension functionaries was not sustained, leading to

achievement of less-than-potential outcomes. This, combined with attrition-ridden and unstable

contractual manpower has been responsible for non-achievement of targets. The report also

pointed out that both public and private extension systems highlight on “what to do”, rather than

also educating on “what not to do”. The latter is equally critical for farmers who are practising

agriculture from generations and are thus sticking to traditional practices. The farmers, thus, need

to be sensitized not only on new practices but also on the need or ineffectiveness of ongoing habits

to pre-empt risks and failures. ATMA which has been envisioned to facilitate linking farmers to

market has been restricted to advisory on production aspects, without catering to marketing

concerns.

ix. Research and Development

Advancement in agriculture can be ensured through continuous research and development in the

domain impacting climate change concerns, food insecurity, the growing relevance of agri-food

chains, and demands for greater rural producer empowerment. The research studies along with

the applications of the innovative solutions and providing extension services such as policy

advise, technical support, projects/ programmes, studies and workshops shall lead to accelerated

development of the sector.

In India, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is an apex research organization of

the country, spearheading agricultural research, education and extension activities for

productivity enhancement and diversification of Indian agriculture. Along with ICAR, the National

Agricultural Research and Education System (NARES) is also one of the top research institutes

contributing to transformative changes in this domain. ICAR has a vast network^83 of 96 ICAR

institutes, 77 All India Coordinated Projects/Networks, four deemed universities, two Central

Agricultural Universities and 641 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) spread across the country. In

addition, there are 62 state Agricultural/ Veterinary/ Horticultural/ Fishery universities and 4

general universities with agricultural faculty, as part of the NARES. The research programs under

the umbrella of ICAR are designed to harnessing the power of science and technology that

promotes food, nutritional and livelihood security of vast population of our country. In the past,

ICAR had been instrumental in ushering Green Revolution in agriculture. The ICAR along with its

partners in the NARES through research and technology developments, enabled the country to

increase the production of foodgrains by 5-fold, horticultural crops by 6-fold, fish by 12-fold

(marine 5-fold and inland 17-fold), milk by 8-fold, and eggs by 27-fold since 1950- 5184.

In the recent years^85 there has been significant effort towards improving crop yield through

producing high yielding crop varieties. In the year 2018, ICAR has developed 372 HYV crops

comprising of 200 of cereals, 49 oilseeds, 47 of pulses, 47 of commercial crops and 29 of forage

crops. Eight bio-fortified varieties of rice, wheat, maize, pearl millets, and lentils having high iron,

zinc, selenium and protein has been developed. Research on genetic augmentation, and

conservation is being pursued intensively across crop varieties and also in various geographies

in an attempt to build a genebank. In crop improvement, there has been considerable focus on

seed technology research and production of breeder seeds. In the year 2017-18, around 5,97,992

quintals of quality seeds had been produced against the target of 3,66,059 quintals which

comprised of foundation seeds, certified seeds, truthfully labelled seeds and planting materials.

Extensive research has been made in zero-budget farming and other indigenous agricultural

technologies to control pest population using pheromones in fruits. Impact of climate change in

wheat is being pursued along with designing adaptation technologies for the same. Agroforestry

system for sustainable crop yields in rainfed areas are being evaluated in various horticulture and

agriculture crops such as amla, fingermillet, custard apple, maize, tamarind among others.

The application of the innovative solutions has been ensured through continuous extension

activities by the Krishi Vigyan Kendras. In 2018, a total of 3354 technologies of various crops were

assessed in 2981 locations by KVKs under the thematic areas of drudgery reduction, farm

machineries, integrated crop management, integrated disease management, integrated nutrient

management, pest management, agro-processing and value addition. The capacity building

programmes included various front line demonstrations and trainings were provided to farmers,

farmer groups, and other practitioners.

As stated in the ICAR Vision 2050, the institute accords highest priority to changing needs of

farmers, which would provide the direction of future research and education investment areas.

The focus areas of research laid by the institution for the country include:

• Genetic potential enhancement of agricultural commodities

• Agricultural productivity, efficiency and profitability improvement

• Resilience to climate change and abiotic and biotic stresses

• Improve nutritional food, and health security

• Risk management against climate change and market stressors

• Agricultural value chains

• Sustainability of natural resources base of agriculture

• Valuation of ecosystem services

• Agricultural markets, policies, and institutions

• Bio-security, especially the one emerging from gene piracy and cross-border vector-borne

diseases

• New products and uses (e.g., bio-energy, new crops, synthetic foods, special foods)

• New educational and learning systems and environments

**Need for Public Private Partnership in Research and development**

The Indian Council of Agriculture Research is an autonomous organisation under the Department

of Agricultural Research and Education. It has more than 100 institutes under its purview. ICARs

play a critical role in agricultural education and research in India and is supported through central

funds. There are 27 institutes that deal with the crop sciences, 23 deal with horticulture sciences

and 19 Institutes that deal with Animal Sciences under ICAR in India. In addition, it has 8 fisheries

institutes, 4 Agricultural engineering institutes and 15 institutes under its NRM division. These

institutes primarily deal with aspects such as crop science, animal husbandry, dairying, fisheries

and horticultural sciences. Apart from these, ICAR also controls institutions that deal with

agricultural education and extension institutes. The ICAR institutions receive funding from

central government, they also earn income through education, research and extension activities.

The BE for ICAR during 2018-19 was Rs 7514.14 crores, which increased by nearly 14.7% from

2017 - 18. The BE allocation for various types of institutes under ICAR is provided in the figure

below.

As can be seen that the highest budget allocation is for Crop Science Institutions, followed by

Animal Sciences Institutes and Agricultural Extension Institutes. The lowest budget is being

allocated to Agricultural economics and statistics. In addition to these, there are projects like

NAHEP and NICRA, which receive separate funding.

The table below shows expenses on research and operations as a percentage of revenue and

capital expenses across different types of institutes in 2017- 18.

As can be seen that the overall budget allocated for research and operations among these ICAR

institutes is very small and ranges between 6 to 12.2%. Among these institutes, NRM institutions

are focusing very little on research, while horticulture and animal science institutes are giving

higher priority to research. It may be noted that higher funds are allocated to these institutions.

the institutions. It was highlighted that the collaboration of institutions needs to be strengthened

and the research should be targeted towards solving problems. The report calls for overhaul of

public sector R&D institutions and create favourable environment agricultural research and

technology development. It recommended to put in place performance indicators for institutions

and individuals and need for modifying the existing rules and regulations to facilitate public

private partnerships in agriculture research.

x. Reforms and Regulations

Reforms in agriculture sector in India is one of the important factor for driving faster growth and

ensuring better remunerations from agriculture as an option of livelihoods. The agriculture sector

contributes around 14.4% to the economy of the country in terms of Gross Value Added from

agriculture, forestry & fishing sector. This sector has been aiming to achieve higher growth

through notable changes such as diversification from grains towards pulses, fruit, vegetables and

livestock products, along with a greater focus on exports of agricultural supplies.

With government impetus on food and nutritional security over the past decades, India has been

able to transform from a food deficit country to a major exporter of agriculture and allied products

such as rice, meat and meat products, cotton, oilcakes, vegetable extracts, fish and fish products.

The demand for agriculture products have shifted from cereal consumption towards pulses, fruit

and vegetables as well as meat and meat products. The share of cereals in calorie intake decreased

from 61% in 2000 to 55.7% in 2013, with livestock products increasing from 12.8% to 17.1% and

fruit and vegetables from 24.5% to 28.7% over the same period.^87 In order to support the dietary

shift, structural changes are required to be brought in through organizing the private sector and

modernizing the retail sector.

One of the critical factors to foster growth in agricultural production is by enabling access to farm

credit, under which Kisan Credit Card scheme had been introduced in 1998 to ensure farmers

could purchase agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides etc. and draw cash for their

production needs.^88 However, institutional credit, especially long and medium term credit

availability is still inadequate compared to the demand. Small and marginal farmers face

difficulties in accessing agricultural credit since it is linked to holding of formal land titles.

Along with growth in food production, the agro-food supply chain has been increasing

consistently over the last few decades. The growth in the supply chain requires establishment of

physical infrastructure and logistics creation. However there has been inadequate progress in

developing road transport services and freight services to support the food supply chain in the

country. Government regulated markets wholesale markets (mandis) do not have the facilities

needed for handling, grading and storing perishable agricultural products and the regulatory

environment has deterred private sector involvement^89. The current regulation, Agricultural

Produce Marketing (Regulation) Acts empowers the state to establish regulated wholesale

markets, construct and manage agricultural markets and regulate all aspects of marketing,

including the levy of user fees. However, there are several constraints to this Act concerning

highly fragmented market structure, insufficient number of markets, inadequate physical

marketing infrastructure, high incidence of marketing fees and charges, high post-harvest waste,

restrictions in licensing, low remuneration to farmers and high intermediation costs, market

information asymmetry, and inadequate credit facilities.^90 To address this issue, the model

Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017 is underway

to include reforms such as issuing single or trading within the State and at the National level, and

including new private players and traders to establish wholesale agri-markets among others. The

new Act intends to ensure better price realization through a transparent system.

The agro-food trade as share of agricultural GDP in India is pegged at 16% as of 2016 and has

increased significantly post the economic reforms after 1990. However, the sector has potential

to grow further given the strong growth of merchandise trade in the country (pegged at 42% of

the GDP as of 2016) and plausible improvements in the currently challenged domestic agro-food

value chain structure. The trade regulations set by India’s Foreign Trade Policy every five years

drive the growth in agro-food trade sector. Some agricultural products have been subject to

export prohibitions, export quotas, and minimum export prices. State trading is required for some

products, and export subsidies are provided. The government provides financial assistance to

exporters for market development, infrastructure development, quality development and

transport assistance. Certain export prohibitions imposed in 2014 on pulses (not chickpeas) and

to all edible oil, have now been removed (except for mustard oil)^91. However, tightening of the

rules on marketing buffaloes for slaughter is likely to negatively affect the production of buffalo

meat for exports and for producing milk.

**Policy and Legislative Reforms Related to Marketing**^92

The Directorate of Agricultural Marketing was first established to keep the prices of agriculture-

based raw material for industries and food items in check. Since marketing of agricultural

produce is a concurrent subject, most states enacted the Agricultural Produce Market Regulation

Act (APMR Act) and all primary wholesale markets operating in the state were bought within the

ambit of these acts. The legislation prevented private players from setting up markets. Over the

years, the markets became more localised with limited infrastructure which curtailed the free

movement of commodities and resulted in the fragmentation of markets. Over time large number

of intermediaries established their foothold which led to multiple levels of charges; resulting in

the escalation of costs for consumers and lower margins for farmers. Realising this, Government

of India introduced a series of reforms to increase efficiency in market transactions to

commensurate benefits for farmers. Key reforms introduced in the past two decades are

illustrated as follows.

Figure 111: Key Reforms Introduced in the Sector

The Model Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation Act) in 2003 was

introduced to encourage private investment in agricultural marketing. It created a window of

opportunity for private players for entering in agricultural marketing. Alternate market channels

were developed in few states as a result of these reforms.

Direct marketing, contract farming and private markets are three major marketing channels

which have evolved after these reforms. The model act also had the provision for private

wholesale markets. Further, liberatlisation took place in 2004 as ban on future trading of 54

commodities was lifted and licensing norms for food processing industries were liberalised.

The registration rules under the Warehousing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2006

introduced Negotiable Warehouse Receipt (NWR) in 2010. The NWR is issued in token of

acceptance of the produce and provides an assurance that it will remain safe up to the end of

storage period mentioned in the receipt. NWR enables transfer of ownership of the commodity

without having to deliver the physical commodity. It is also eligible as collateral for short term

finance. The rules were amended in 2017 to allow the issuance of e-NWR as part of the next level

reforms. It is now compulsory for all WDRA registered warehouses to issue e-NWR warehouse

receipts. An e-NWR minimizes risks in transactions and ensures better transparency.

Government of India launched the ambitious National Agricultural Market scheme in 2016 as an

effort towards market integration of various APMCs functional across India. Its initial phase

targeted the integration of 585 markets across India.The scheme is aimed at the integration of

agricultural markets across India to facilitate pan-India trade. This will help in price stabilisation

and better marketing opportunities for farmers and sellers. The scheme also provides for the

development of infrastructure and quality assaying facilities for selected commodities at market

level^93.

The states are also required to take following mandatory reforms in their APMC Acts.

• Provision for single trading license which is valid across the State

• Single point of levy of market fee across the State; and

• Provision for e-auction / e-trading as a mode of price discovery to be facilitated by the

State Agriculture Marketing Department / Board / APMCs / Regulated Market

Committees (RMCs), as the case may be.

The challenges related to e-NAM and direct marketing are elaborated in ISAM scheme analysis

and issue and challenges sections of the report.

The model APML act has also been introduced in 2017. The new act allows more players to set up

markets; it also introduces other reforms such as a cap on market and commission agents fee and

introduces provisions for declaration of warehouses/silos/cold storage as market sub-yards. The

Act allows farmers to sell their produce to preferred buyers at a place of their choice. The model

act also has provisions on livestock marketing, e-trading, contract farming and standardization

and quality certification. It also sought states to put restrictions on mandi tax limits. However,

many are yet to adapt the model act and have adopted only some of its provisions.

The lack of integration in existing marketing infrastructure from aggregation, assaying,

transportation, storage and distribution and lack of differentiated approach in infrastructure

development with mere focus on only storage of excess produce were highlighted as key

bottleneck in appropriate price realisation for farmers^94. The interventions for increasing price

realisation to farmers needs to be supported by stable trade regime and a more farmer oriented

policy shift^95. A need to liberalize stock limits and control regulations has also been highlighted in

multiple reports^96 to promote agribusiness and exports of key agricultural commodities.

In view of this, the recent ordinances have been introduced which further liberalise the

amendment acts, the new set of ordinances introduced in 2020 have also proposed new set of

reforms, some of which are in-line with the some of the key bottlenecks highlighted in sectoral

analysis and scheme analysis marketing schemes. For instance, the recent ordinance amends the

Essential Commodities Act, 19 5 5 and eases the restrictions on stock limits imposed by the older

versions of the act. The ordinance also restricts the imposition of stock limits on essential

commodities to instances wherein substantial rise in retail price of the commodity is recorded.

The Farmer's Produce Trade And Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, states

that no market fee or levy shall be levied for scheduled produce in a trade area, it also includes

state APMC act or other state laws. This is similar to the model APLM act, however, the key

difference is that the ordinance has defined the scheduled produce and also exempted the

transaction from levy under other state acts. This reform is likely to ease transactions of

commodities in the state and help in controlling the price of commodity. However, the impact of

ordinance has to be evaluated carefully, considering that the farmers do not pay mandi taxes but

the traders or commission agents have to pay. In addition, it has been observed that farmers tend

to get better price realisation in market yards due to regulation and competition, trading in

markets also help them in getting price related information. Many states have already made

amendments so that the farmers are able to sell their produce anywhere in state. After the

ordinance, the waiving off of market fee for trade outside market premises may encourage the

traders to purchase the produce outside of the market premise. This may make the market yards

and premises less useful and regulation of trade difficult, resulting in farmers may not receiving

the right price due to absence of regulation.

The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services

Ordinance, 2020 as the name suggests seeks to promote price assurance for farmers by providing

a national framework on farming agreements. This will enable farmers to engage with agri-

business firms, retailers, wholesalers, exporters for farm services and sale of produce.

xi. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives (e.g.

Farmer cooperatives, FPOs, Water User Associations, etc.) and civil society in the

scheme

Agricultural cooperatives are socio-economic organizations which have played a significant role

across the world in organizing the small farmers who are responsible for 80% of the world food

production^97. With a presence of 85% small and marginal farmers in India, it is critical to enhance

the impact of the cooperative sector and create opportunities and income for marginal farmers in

the country. Various grass-root institutions have been formed to represent the farmers’

community, facilitated by state / national level Boards, Cooperatives and Corporations. Some of

the formal decentralized organizations are Gram Sabhas, Watershed Committees, Forest

Management Committees, Milk Societies, PACSs (Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies),

APMCs (Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees), and WAUs (Water User Associations).

Voluntary institutions like SHGs (Self Help Groups), JLGs (Joint Liability Groups), Commodity

Interest Groups (CIGs), FPOs (Farmer Producer Organizations – both cooperatives and

companies) have been formed across the country and brought under the purview of NABARD,

SFAC and NRLM for further structured facilitation, capacity building and nurturing.

Presently, around 5000 FPOs (including FPCs) are in existence in the country, which have been

formed under various initiatives of the Govt. of India (including SFAC), State Governments,

NABARD and other organizations over the last 8-10 years. Of these, around 3200 FPOs are

registered as Producer Companies and the remaining as Cooperatives/ Societies, etc.

In India, FPOs are supported primarily by two organizations namely,

1.  NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development)
2.  SFAC (Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Consortium)

The total state-wise bifurcation of FPOs supported by NABARD as well as by SFAC as on 15th

August 2019 are highlighted below on the map of India:

shareholder membership ranging from 100 to over 1000 farmers and require not only technical

handholding support but also adequate capital and infrastructure facilities including market

linkages for sustaining their business operations.

**Leveraging start-up eco-system for strengthening value chains by engaging private players**

Private sector participation under various schemes has been quite limited. Private sector

engagement can help in driving technology led innovation, extension, logistics and forward

linkages.

India is supporting agri-tech start-ups that are engaged in diverse set of activities and

strengthening of value chain creation. Incubator support programs targeting agri-startups have

been launched through Startup India. In addition, all Indian states also have policies and

incentives that support agri-startups in India. Government supported institutions such as

IITs also provide incubation support to agri-tech firms. Among the schemes, RKVY is encouraging

innovative practices through encouragement to agri-entrepreneurship. It supports agri-business

incubation by encouraging innovations and technologies for value chain development in

agriculture. In addition, it provides grants to the existing institutional agri-business incubators on

a need basis. Nearly 10% of the annual outlay under RKVY is earmarked for encouraging

innovation and agri-entrepreneurs. Additionally, under the flexi-funds component, states can

support projects as per their local needs, preferably for innovative activities in agriculture and

allied sectors. The scheme also promotes coordination of ICAR/ SAUs with private players for

providing improved varieties of seeds/ seedlings and introducing innovative technologies. RKVY-

RAFTAAR is also supporting the UPJA 2020 program by PUSA Krishi which offers grant in aid of

up to Rs 25 lakh to the start-ups and also provides mentoring support for developing industry

connects and piloting the initiative.

Currently, agri-incubators are driving agri-tech sector in India. The new start-ups and ventures

are offering range of technology driven services including, personalised advisory, early warning

crop protection, decision support systems through analytics, input-supply, aggregation, tech-

support, logistics, affordable infrastructure, precision agriculture and irrigation services, credit,

value addition and marketing etc. Thus, catering to the entire agriculture value chain. Many are

engaging with farmer groups, FPOs and micro-entrepreneurs. They are also connecting farmers

and groups to institutional buyers who procure agricultural produce for processing, value

addition and self-consumption.

Farming in India needs to shift from one size fits all approach, and go for a flexible region specific

precision agriculture. Agri-tech firms can help in creating this awareness by promoting resource

efficient site-specific farming practices. This will help in reducing productivity losses and

encourage efficient utilisation of farm inputs thereby optimizing cost of production. Private sector

can also help in developing ‘farm to fork’ value chain by providing integrated services, on demand

integrated infrastructure and marketing support. This will help in mitigating risks of sudden price

fall during a good harvest.

The growth of start-ups provides an opportunity for the sector, they can be utilised for technical

support and development of programme implementation. Many emerging start-ups and agri-tech

firms have technical expertise and can provide range of services that can complement existing

schemes and fill gaps. They can be engaged for advisory and extension services, input supply and

production of key inputs, farmer mobilisation, logistic supply, tech support, logistics, post-harvest

solutions for food losses and development of farm-gate low cost infrastructure.

The engagement of agri-tech firms and involvement will help in technology transfer, this will also

enable and motivate private players to come forward in sectoral growth and make agricultural

more profitable.

Apart from FPOs and agri-tech startups, the impact and role of private players has been

highlighted in scheme level analysis, for example, the role Participatory Irrigation Management

and Water User Associations and Private Public Partnership Model in Integrated Micro Irrigation

has been described in-detail for PMKSY-PDMC.

However, it is important to note that the current set of schemes do not have sufficient provisions

for private sector engagement for research, implementation and collaboration. Most of the

interventions are being implemented through state departments or government agencies, only

few scheme components support engagement with entrepreneurs or FPOs.

1.3 Issues and Challenges

**Food Security Concerns** : Agriculture in India contributes significantly to the economy of the

country. India is world largest producer of milk, pulses, and spices, and has the world’s largest

cattle herd (buffaloes), as well as owns the largest area under wheat, rice and cotton, making the

nation a global agricultural powerhouse. However, global benchmarking of most agricultural

commodities bring out the issue of low

productivity of agricultural produce in

India. As depicted in the figure given

alongside the rank of India in yield rate

is much poor although it happens to be

one of the top producers of the

agricultural commodities across the

globe. Raising the productivity of

agricultural commodities per unit of

land have remained one of the top

concerns in the sector and all

agricultural policy framed since 1960

have been taking measures to address

it. The low yield rate is attributed to

the low level of mechanization in

agriculture coupled with large

sections of rural population resorting

to subsistence farming. Despite its

continuous endeavour to attain self-

sufficiency in crop production, India

has to import significant amount of

wheat and is still a net importer of vegetable oil.

**Slow Growth in Farmers’ Income:** Income of farmers has been one of the major challenges in

this sector leading to a constant decrease in the agricultural labour over the years. As per the

current trend in income of farmers over the last decade it is evident the growth rate has not been

consistently growing over the period. While farmers’ income declined at 0.55% per annum

between 1999–2000 and 2004–05, it increased at 7. 46 % per annum during the period between

2004 – 05 and 2011-12. The growth rate of farmers’ income between 2004–05 and 2011– 12 has

been observed to be the highest since the beginning of economic reforms.^99

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

However, as discussed in the Doubling Farmers’ Income Report, the ambitious target of doubling

farmers income by 2022-23 would require farm income growth rate of 10.4 per cent per year for

the nation.^100 The farmer’s income from farm and non-farm activities is pegged at Rs 96,703 per

annum as of 2015-16. The targeted income of farmers from farm and non-farm activities is

aspired to be Rs 172694 as of 2022-23 (in 2015-16 prices)^101 and this can be possible only with

an accelerated growth rate of farmers’ income consistently over the period. The farmer’s income

which consists of farm activities and non-farm activities is estimated to grow at 10.36% per

annum and 5.66% per annum respectively during the period 2015-16 and 2022-23. However,

wages from non-farm activities have been observed to be declining sharply in the recent years. As

analysed from the Labour Bureau series, Wage Rates in Rural India (WRRI), shows that the wage

rate had been increasing until 2012–13, post which it has been decelerating and has declined in

real terms for both agricultural and non-agricultural labourers.^102 Real wages of agricultural

labourers have declined at 0.3% per annum between 2013 and 2017, whereas non-agricultural

wages have declined by 1.1% during the same period. This trend has been a bottleneck for the

revival of farmer’s income in recent years.

Lack of Agricultural Credit: The rural economy has slumped post 2014-15 with the growth rate

of agriculture^103 declining to 1.86% between 2014-15 and 2017-18 as against a comparatively

stronger growth of 3.5% per annum between 2011-12 and 2013-14 as shown in the table below.

slowed down to 12.3% between 2014–15 and 2016–17, as compared to 21% per annum in

nominal terms between 2004–05 and 2014–15. The lack of access to credit has negatively

impacted the agriculture sector which direly needs investment on mechanization of agricultural

operations and the shifting cropping pattern towards high value agriculture which includes

farming of cash crops and horticulture. Availability of farm credit is one of the key components to

enable increase in productivity through ensuring substantive investment in irrigation, seeds and

fertilizers and new technology. Development of post-harvest infrastructure and value addition in

agrarian activities also requires monetization and hence is likely to be affected due to the gradual

declining trend in agricultural credit.

Distribution of agricultural credit is also observed to be highly skewed across different states. The

regional distribution of agricultural credit disbursement is shown in the figure below.

Figure 119: Percentage of Agricultural Credit Disbursement (till September 2018)

Source: Economic Survey 2019-20, Chapter 07 Agriculture and Food Management

As it can be seen from the figure above, the distribution of agricultural credit is low in North

Eastern, Hilly and Eastern States. The share of North Eastern States has been less than one per

cent in total agricultural credit disbursement.^104

**Water Reduction and Irrigation Strengthening:** India accounts for only about 4 per cent of

global water resources, but supports 18 per cent of the World’s human population. India’s per

capita water availability is steadily declining due to population growth. According to estimates of

Doubling Farmer’s Income report, India will be a water stressed country^105 on the basis of per

capita water availability in 2050 with only 686 cubic meter per year^106. Water required for

irrigation purpose is estimated at around 75-85 per cent share in the total demand by the

Standing Sub-Committee of MoWR.

(^104) Economic Survey 2019-20, Chapter 07 Agriculture and Food Management

With over 80% of the total water in the country being used in agriculture, measures need to be

taken for sustainable usage.

The vulnerability of crop production due to water stress is also aggravated by the high

dependence of the country’s agriculture land on rainfall. Around 52% of India’s cultivated land is

dependent on monsoon rains. The rainfed areas constitute about three fourth of land mass under

arid, semi-arid, and dry humid situations and are characterized by low levels of productivity and

low input usage. The variations in rainfall and water availability in different parts of the country

proves to be a problem for region-specific water scarcity. While average annual rainfall of the

country is about 1,170 mm, it varies from an average high of 10,000 mm per year in North East

and a low of just 100 mm per annum in some parts of Western Rajasthan. The Ganga-Brahmaputra

river basin contributes to more than 50 per cent of total annual water availability, whereas,

Southern and Western basins account for only about 15% each.^107

There is also sub-optimal utilization of irrigation in the country. Inadequate maintenance of canal

system, lack of participatory management, changing land use pattern, deviation from the

designated cropping pattern, soil degradation and delay in command area development attribute

to the issue of under-utilization of irrigation potential. While there is around 35%-40% of overuse

in surface irrigation systems, and 65 per cent in case of ground water use, water efficient

irrigation like micro irrigation has not penetrated in many parts of the country.

The issue of water availability in agriculture is aggravated owing to the current cropping system

in the country. High proportion of cultivated area under water intensive crops like rice, sugarcane

etc. is not well managed through water efficient irrigation systems. Diversification from rice and

sugarcane to low duty crops such as millets, maize, pulses and oilseeds are not opted by farmers.

There is lack of promotion of low water duty crops like maize, pulses & oilseeds replacing rice,

sugarcane, banana, cotton etc. especially in over-exploited regions. As per assessment of Central

Ground Water Board, the over-exploited regions are significantly higher in Delhi, Haryana,

Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.^108 There is lack

of awareness generation among farmers on proper use of irrigation water at critical stages of crop

growth under different soil and environment conditions.

**Problem of Pests and Diseases** : One of the main threats to agriculture are from pests and

diseases that destroy crops. In India, the farmer’s crop yield losses range from 15 to 25 per cent

(^107) NITI Aayog. 2017. Doubling Farmers’ Income – Volume VII, Chapter 2

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

owing to the presence of weeds, pests, diseases and rodents. Although India uses an average of

0.5 kg per ha of pesticide (which is much lower compared to USA, South Korea, Japan or Europe),

within the country there are wide variations between regions, crops and across irrigated-rainfed

status. The intensity of pesticide usage is high in case of certain crops, particularly when raised in

irrigated systems.^109 High usage of chemical pesticides also impacts health and safety of other

flora and fauna, including humans which needs to be replaced with organic solutions to prevent

diseases. Sale of spurious and misbranded pesticides is one of the biggest challenges faced by the

agriculture community posing danger to the crop, human health and environment. Lack of

monitoring of bio-pesticide registrations and lack of comprehensive data on dealers and

pesticides being sold in the market are some of the underlying reasons of the problem. In addition

there is need to sensitize farmers adequately along with increasing the reach of Integrated Pest

Management techniques. There is lack of effective pest surveillance mechanism in Integrated Pest

Management and in adequate availability of IPM inputs like bio-control agents, bio-pesticides,

light traps, rodent traps, pheromone traps, sticky traps, seed treatment drums etc. which needs

to be addressed. The price of pesticides (both branded and generic) is uncontrolled and is

observed to be increasing affecting the cost incurred by farmers.

**Low Level of Farm Mechanization:** Farm mechanization helps in efficient utilization of all farm

inputs like seeds, fertilizer and water, thus increasing the productivity of land and labour. It also

helps in cost minimization by arresting the rising wages of labour being used in the farm.

Agricultural mechanization mitigates farm drudgery, increases the pace of work at farm and aids

in enhancing farmers’ income. In India, lack of access to farm power is one of the primary reasons

for slow uptake of farm mechanization, particularly among small and marginal farmers. Farm

mechanization is varied across different states. The level of farm mechanization is high at about

40%-45% in states like UP, Haryana and Punjab, but extremely low in north-eastern and hilly

states^110. The level of farm mechanization in India is still low as compared to the countries such

as the U. S. (95 %), Brazil (75%) and China (57%). The percentage of agricultural workers in total

work force is expected to drop to 25.7% by 2050 from 58.2% in 2001 and farm mechanization

can be the solution to address this challenge. As highlighted earlier, agricultural mechanization

demands supply of farm power which is currently a challenge in Indian context. The available

farm power is 2.02 kW/Ha as of 2016- 17111 which is still low to introduce tractors and power

tillers. Availability of credit for power tillers and tractors also pose a critical issue. The procedure

to avail agriculture term loan is known to be cumbersome and the rate of interest is higher for

farm mechanization based loans^112.

**Lower Adoption of Good Agricultural Practices** : The concept of Good Agricultural Practices in

agriculture has emerged as a solution catering to the challenges of improving food security,

manage increasing demand and conserve the natural resources. A GAP approach intends to

address the demand-side priorities of consumers and retailers, as well as the supply-side

priorities of producers and labourers. In the era of declining factor productivity and degradation

of natural resource base of agricultural production system, there is an urgent need to develop

GAPs. In India, adoption of GAP is at a nascent stage. To promote good agricultural practices, India

Good Agricultural Practices (INDGAP) certification scheme has been developed by Quality Council

of India. INDGAP aims to cover small and marginal farmers and enable them to adopt in a phased

manner. The Indian Good Agricultural Practices (INDGAP) takes into account not only the quality

and quantity of the produce obtained from a unit area but also the care is taken in integrating

preharvest practices like soil & water management, nutrient management and pest management,

harvesting, post-harvest handling and other logistics. INDGAP has been implemented in

harvesting rice, zero-till wheat and other crops. However, there are several challenges in

implementing Good Agricultural Practices in aspects such as seed and sowing, seed priming,

precision planting techniques, and using improved farm machinery. Studies have revealed lack of

awareness about critical GAPs among farmers^113.

**Post-Harvest Losses and Challenges of Infrastructure** : One of the growing challenges in the

agriculture sector is the problem of food loss and food waste. Reducing food loss and waste is the

key to reduce production costs, increase the efficiency of the food system, improve food security

and nutrition, and contribute towards environmental sustainability. Globally around 14 percent

of the world’s food is lost from the post-harvest stage up to, excluding, the retail stage. In Central

and Southern Asia, the percentage of food loss is as high as 20%-21%.^114

The need for warehousing and cold chain development is a critical step for prevention of post-

harvest losses. Inadequate storage conditions, and climatic factors like heat and moisture cause

biological deterioration especially without proper storage and transportation. In India, loss of

perishable food items like fruits and vegetables, meat and fish are attributable to poor

infrastructure and in adequate cold storage facilities. According to Global Cold Chain Alliance^115 ,

India has an average of 0.34 cubic meters of refrigerated warehousing space per urban resident

and is in the 8th place globally as of 2018^116. This indicates there is potential to improve cold chain

infrastructure in the country in order to handle its agricultural produce better.

**Challenges in Food Processing** : Contribution of agriculture to the economy can be enhanced by

improving the food processing industry. High production level of agricultural inputs provide

immense opportunity to improve its processing sector and at the same time create employment

opportunities as well. India currently processes less than 10%^117 of its agricultural output (only

around 2% of fruits and vegetables, 6% of poultry, 21% of meat, 23% of marine and 35% of milk)

and most of the processing that is done in India can be classified as primary processing – done

through rice, sugar, edible oil and flour mills etc. Primary processing offers lower value-addition

compared to secondary processing that includes processing of high value items viz fruits and

vegetables, dairy, bakery, meat and fish items etc. Despite being the second largest producer of

the fruits and vegetables in the world, the processing levels in fruits and vegetables currently

stand at a low of 2%. The current processing levels in poultry are 6%, while for meat it stands at

21%. With scope of improving exports in the processing sector, this industry also needs to

standardise the mandatory requirements of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures^118 to ensure

quality control and food safety. Agricultural exports from the country often face bans due to non-

compliance of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. Food processing levels vary significantly

across states of India. Southern region has the highest numbers of registered factories with

Andhra Pradesh accounting for about 14.75% followed by Tamil Nadu accounting for about

12.77% and Telangana accounting for about 9.99% of the total registered factories. There is much

lower penetration of FPI industries in Eastern states. In terms of the equipment of processing,

there is a huge deficit of pack houses at the farm gate, cold storage facilities across the value chain,

multi - modal logistics, government certified labs and mechanised handling and loading. The

sector is also affected by the lack of demand-based innovations as well as efficient and reliable

marketing networks.

**Issues in Agricultural Marketing:** An efficient agricultural marketing system ensures

transparent price discovery maintaining operational efficiency resulting in proper remuneration

to the farmers as well as offer affordable rates to consumers. Extent of price dispersion for the

same produce, across multiple markets in the country is indicative of the efficacy of the

agricultural marketing system. As discussed in Figure 74 , farm gate price dispersion is found to

be high among all crops in India, especially among perishable crops like potato, onion and

groundnuts. The variation in prices between farm-gate and consumer is attributed to factors like

lack of logistics connecting farm-gate with the wholesale market at consumer end, connectivity,

degree of private sector competition, propensity of regional exposure to shocks, local storage

capacity, mandi infrastructure and farmers access to them, storage life of the crop and crop

specific processing cost^119. There is lack of market intelligence system that monitors and analysis

other economic signal for the purpose of marketing efficiency. Some of the key policy instruments

that have been adopted to streamline marketing system includes regulation of markets through

the APMC Act, input subsidies for producers, minimum support prices (MSP), and food subsidies

for consumers. However, the current APMC Act has several shortcomings in terms of prohibitive

license fee, high commission, marketing fee, and APMC cess levied to farmers. The penetration of

agricultural markets varies across states with the density of regulated markets being 118 sq km.

in Punjab to 11,214 sq km. in Meghalaya. The current regulated markets lack most of the essential

marketing infrastructure such as auction platforms, common drying yards, electronic weigh-

bridges, grading facilities and cold storage units. While covered and open auction platforms exist

only in two-thirds of the regulated markets, only one-fourth of the markets have common drying

yards, one-tenth of the markets have cold storage units and grading facilities are there in less than

one-third of the markets^120. The current agricultural marketing system lacks efficient supply chain

having large number of marketing channels and adding up more of costs without adding

significant value. Lack of developed alternative marketing channels like direct marketing, contract

farming has resulted in low farmer’s price realization. Reforms in the agricultural marketing

system is hence required to build an efficient and robust marketing system.

**Gaps in Research and Development** : Green Revolution-I sought to bring food security to the

nation. The next revolution, Green Revolution-II was launched to ensure income security of the

farmers by applying science and technology to all sub-sectors of agriculture such as agriculture,

horticulture, dairy & livestock, fishery and aquaculture. Research and development in agriculture

requires to focus on income-guided ventures to ensure applicability of the interventions. Some of

the domains in agriculture that lack research gaps are irrigated ecosystems, hill agriculture,

coastal agriculture, seed production system. There is a wide gap in irrigation potential created

and its utilisation which needs to be bridged through use of potential technologies such as

(^119) NITI Aayog. 2017. Doubling Farmers’ Income Report Volume IV

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

breeding water use efficient varieties, adopting water use efficient cropping system (crop

alignment), water use efficient technologies like micro-irrigation, sensors etc. In rainfed

agriculture as well, management of natural resources needs to be supported by technology led

sustainable development systems. Soil and water conservation methods are required to be

supported by evolution & promotion of appropriate technologies including crop diversification,

developing crop genotypes, and alternate land use systems. There are gaps in applying modern

technology in developing improved varieties of crops and hybrids, refinement of seed-production

technologies and production of breeder seeds. The agriculture sector needs a robust seed

production system which would address low seed replacement rate, low varietal replacement

rate, lack of seed grid and seeds resistant to abiotic and biotic stresses. High value agriculture

crop sector like horticulture is highly dependent on advanced research and development on

genetic resource enhancement, enhancing the efficiency of production and reducing post-harvest

losses. Research and developmental gaps exist in respect of effective management, enhancing the

shelf life of perishable fruits, vegetables, flowers, product diversification and value addition for

better profitability. Technology and automation is also key to food processing sector to address

the required levels of quality control, production speed, labor shortages and overall profitability.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Implementation Structure and Stakeholders**

The Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare oversees implementation of the

Umbrella scheme. Most of the schemes under Green Revolution are implemented and steered

through the State Agriculture Department on the basis of District Agriculture Plans (DAP) and

State Agriculture Plans (SAP). Dedicated committees and bodies are set up at all the three levels

to facilitate the smooth functioning and implementation of the activities, tracking the progress as

per the set indicators and monitoring the various projects executed in the scheme. At the National

level, the schemes are piloted by either National General/Executive Council or National Advisory

Committee, while at the state level, a state level executive committee or project sanctioning

committee is responsible for approving projects and implementing the scheme. A committee of

Project Monitoring Team (PMT) has been established at the district level in some schemes to

monitor on-ground execution. The Gram Panchayats also oversee projects in some schemes.

Some of the associated stakeholders to the scheme are members from Indian Council of

Agricultural Research (ICAR), State Agriculture Universities, civil institutions and Non-

Governmental organizations, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD),

Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC), and Agricultural & Processed Food Products

Export Development Authority (APEDA). The implementing structure and stakeholders across

the major schemes under Green Revolution has been illustrated below:

2.2 Individual Scheme Level Analysis

2.2.1 Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana – Per Drop More Crop

Background of the Scheme

Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PMKSY) was launched in 2015, integrating micro

irrigation in the flagship scheme as an integral component of the scheme^121. Earlier to this scheme,

a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for micro irrigation was launched in 2006 and was later up-scaled

to National Mission on Micro Irrigation (NMMI), which continued till the year 2013-14. NMMI was

further subsumed under National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and implemented

as “On Farm Water Management” (OFWM) during the financial year 2014-15. In 2015, Micro

Irrigation component of OFWM has been subsumed under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee

Yojana following the earlier pattern of assistance and cost norms as under OFWM.

The scheme aims to provide protective irrigation to all agriculture farms across the nation to

boost farm output and income. PMKSY programme is developed to achieve convergence of

investment in irrigation for improving on-farm water use efficiency.

The PMKSY - Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) scheme component mainly focuses on enhancing water

use efficiency at farm level through micro irrigation viz. Drip Irrigation and Sprinkler Irrigation.

Besides promoting precision irrigation and better on-farm water management practices to

optimize the use of available water resources, this component also supports micro level water

storage or water conservation/management activities as Other Interventions (OI) to supplement

Micro Irrigation. However, the OI activities must be linked with Micro Irrigation to make potential

use of the available funds for higher water use efficiency.

The PMKSY - Per Drop More Crop component of the scheme is managed by the Ministry of

Agriculture^122. This component focuses on the micro level storage structures, efficient water

conveyance & application, precision irrigation systems, topping up of input cost beyond

MGNREGA permissible limits, secondary storage, water lifting devices, extension activities,

coordination & management - being implemented by DAC&FW^123. The activities in this

component include:

• Micro Irrigation (MI): Focusing on water use efficiency enhancement

o Drip Irrigation

o Sprinkler Irrigation

• Other Interventions (OI): Supplementing drought proofing measures

o Water storage/ harvesting structures

o Secondary Storage Structure

o Ground water development and recharge

o Renovation of existing water bodies

o Water conveyance and water lifting devices etc

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The scheme aims to implement micro-irrigation technology in water consuming crops such as

sugarcane, cotton, banana, etc. Industry related to the specific crops such as sugar factories is also

engaged in promotion of micro irrigation to their farmers through incentives and technical

supervision. The benefits of micro-irrigation^124 are:

• Increase in water efficiency – 50 to 90%

• Energy consumption savings – 30.5%

• Fertiliser consumption savings – 28.5%

• Productivity increase: fruit/crops – 42.4% and vegetables – 52.7%

• Irrigation cost savings – 31.9%

• New crop introduction – 30.4% farmers

• Increase in Farmers’ income – 42%

Nearly 55% of Indian agriculture is still dependent on rainfall. PMKSY aims at providing

protective irrigation to all agriculture farms across the nation to boost farm output and income.

PMKSY programme is developed to achieve convergence of investment in irrigation for improving

on-farm water use efficiency. PMKSY has been conceived by amalgamating ongoing schemes of

Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), Integrated Watershed Management

Programme (IWMP) and the On Farm Water Management (OFWM).

**Objectives of the programme** :

• Achieve convergence of investments in irrigation at the field level (preparation of district

level and, if required, sub district level water use plans).

• Enhance the physical access of water on the farm and expand cultivable area under

assured irrigation (Har Khet ko Pani)

• Integration of water source, distribution and its efficient use, to make best use of water

through appropriate technologies and practices.

• Improve on-farm water use efficiency to reduce wastage and increase availability both in

duration and extent

• Enhance the adoption of precision-irrigation and other water saving technologies (More

crop per drop).

• Enhance recharge of aquifers and introduce sustainable water conservation practices

• Ensure the integrated development of rainfed areas using the watershed approach

towards soil and water conservation, regeneration of ground water, arresting runoff,

providing livelihood options and other NRM activities.

• Promote extension activities relating to water harvesting, water management and crop

alignment for farmers and grass root level field functionaries.

• Explore the feasibility of reusing treated municipal waste water for peri-urban agriculture

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Attract greater private investments in irrigation.

**Strategy and focus areas** :^125

The programme aims to develop end-to-end solution in irrigation supply chain. Broad focus areas

of PMKSY are:

• Creation, repair, maintenance, restoration and renovation of water resources

• Develop distribution network of protective and assured irrigation resources

• Scientific Soil Moisture conservation for runoff control

• Efficient water conveyance and water use efficiency through drips, sprinklers,

underground piping systems

• Promote community irrigation

• Farmer oriented training and capacity building in efficient water and crop management

practices

**Programme Components**

• Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP)

• PMKSY (Har Khet ko Pani)

• PMKSY (Per Drop More Crop)

• PMKSY (Watershed development)

As mentioned earlier, the PMKSY (Per Drop More Crop) is being implemented by Department of

Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture.

**The key activities under the PMKSY (Per Drop More Crop) component are:**^126

• Programme management, preparation of State/District Irrigation Plan, approval of annual

action plan, Monitoring and control

• Promoting efficient water conveyance and precision water application through devices

like drips, sprinklers, pivots, rain-guns in the farm (Jal Sinchan);

• Topping up of input cost particularly under civil construction beyond permissible limit

(40%), under MGNREGS for activities like lining inlet, outlet, silt traps, distribution system

etc.

• Construction of micro irrigation structures to supplement source creation activities

including tube wells and dug wells^127

• Secondary storage structures at tail end of canal system to store water for use during dry

periods through effective on-farm water management;

• Water lifting devices like diesel/ electric/ solar pumpsets including water carriage pipes.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Extension activities for promotion of scientific moisture conservation and agronomic

measures to maximise use of available water (Jal Sarankchan);

• Capacity building, training for encouraging efficient use of water sources Awareness

campaign on water saving technologies, practices, programmes etc.,

• Improved/innovative distribution system like pipe and box outlet system with controlled

outlet and other activities of enhancing water use efficiency.

**Intended contribution to the sector**

The PMKSY - Per Drop More Crop scheme component has been designed to improve water use

efficiency through adoption of precision-irrigation and other water saving technologies and

together with the other components of PMKSY achieve the objective of providing an end-to-end

solution to the irrigation supply chain. The holistic PMKSY scheme principally focuses on

increasing gross irrigated area, bridging the gap between irrigation potential and utilized

potential, and augmenting water use efficiency and management. In order to achieve this, the

Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (now Ministry of Jal

Shakti) and the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare are required to converge to remove

redundancies yet ensure accountability of implementation of this scheme. The primary focus of

the scheme is creating micro irrigation structures for precision farming. Integrating the micro

irrigation system with the pump irrigation or any other command area for source of water would

ensure conservation and the efficient use of water, minimal wastage of water and higher

productivity of crops with less water consumption by the usage of the drip irrigation method and

the sprinkler irrigation method. This innovative technology intends to replace flood irrigation and

impacting in nominal transmission losses, as well as reduced losses through evaporation, run-off

and deep percolation. Ultimately the activities under micro irrigation would serve the purpose of

conserve water, utilize the available water in larger areas under agriculture and boost yield of

agriculture. The technology adopted for such precision farming are drip irrigation, sprinklers and

micro drip irrigation.

To enhance the impact of micro irrigation, further activities under Supplementary Water

Management Activities (SWMA)/ Other Interventions are also included. Under this area, farm

level secondary storage structures such as individual or community water storage, drought

proofing structures such as water harvesting or recharge or ground water development,

renovation of existing water bodies, enhancing water conveyance efficiency and water lifting

devices are created. Creation of these water harvesting structures are further augmented with the

supplementary component under the scheme PMKSY.

**Intended Contribution towards national and international goals**

The scheme is aligned with the national development agenda of modernizing agriculture under

Doubling Farmers Income by 2030. The scheme components focuses on creation of infrastructure

and assets at the farm level to complement/supplement initiatives for drought proofing. The

structures like micro level storage structures, conveyance, secondary water storage, water lifting

devices etc. for increasing productivity of agriculture is the primary focus of the scheme. This

complies with the national indicators such as modernizing agricultural technology, increase

productivity, efficiency and crop diversification.

The scheme is also aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The scheme is

contributing significantly towards the following goals by promoting sustainable agriculture:

Nearly Rs 11,982 crores have been released for the scheme interventions, of which nearly 71.12%

is for MI and 28.8% is for SWMA. Overall the programme has achieved 83.5% of its overall targets

from 2015-2019. It has achieved 100% of its target for micro-irrigation in 2015-16 and 2016-17.

Thereafter the targets were significantly raised and achievements declined. In case of

Supplementary Water Management Activities (SWMA), the progress declined sharply in 2018- 19

as compared to 2017-18. The targets were rationalised in 2019-20 and performance improved as

100% of the financial targets for MI were met. However, the progress in SWMA has been slow as

only 59.6% of overall targets for SWMA has been met during this period, as can be seen from the

chart that barring 2017 - 18 (95% achievement) the progress in achieving SWMA targets has been

poor.

**Physical targets and achievements**^130

Figure 122: Physical targets and achievements (in lakh ha)

The programme has been able to achieve 87.1% of its physical targets from 2015- 2019 on MI, it

has also achieved 100% of its targets in 2015-16 and 2016-17, thereafter, the targets were raised

significantly. Though the achievement in 2017-18 and 2018-19 were higher than previous years,

the targets were not achieved. The targeted achievements are however fairly close to targets

proposed in the action plan proposed by DAC&FW^131 in Road map of PMKSY 2017. In 2019-20,

83.6% of physical targets were achieved for MI whereas 0.97 lakh hectare of irrigation potential

was created under other interventions

**Micro-irrigation**

Under micro-irrigation component, Drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation have been promoted

to increase water use efficiency. Micro-irrigation was an independent scheme that has been

merged into PMKSY in 2016-17. Since 2015- 16 till March 2020. 37.24 lakh Ha have been covered

under micro-irrigation, 55% of which is covered under drip-irrigation and 45% under

sprinklers.^132

Of the total area covered under micro-irrigation, largest area was covered in states of Karnataka

(24.8%), Andhra Pradesh (19.98%), Gujarat (18.8%), Tamil Nadu (16.61%) and Maharashtra

(16.26%) during the period 2015- 2020133. This clearly shows that the implementation of MI

activities is concentrated in only few states.

11.71 lakh hectare of area was bought under MI in 2019-20. South Indian states of Tamil Nadu

(22.5%), Karnataka (21.4%) and Andhra Pradesh (10.4%) together contributed to nearly 54.3%

of total area bought under MI. Which again is in-line with the previous year’s trend this highlights

that the scheme progress is limited to very few states.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and Equity

Framework

**Relevance**

• As per Central Water Commission, 85.3% of the total water consumed in India was for

agriculture in 2000 and is likely to reduce to 83.3% by 2025. India is a water deficient

nation with estimated per capita availability of 1400 cubic meter in 2018. PMKSY-PDMC

focusses on water use efficiency and enhancement including providing support to drought

proofing measures and therefore, the scheme is relevant in addressing the identified

constraints for the sector.

• Moreover, the scheme is important considering the current scenario where water

conservation to ward-off future water scarcity is becoming a global concern.

• The scheme currently does not measure the savings in water consumption as a direct

measure of water use efficiency, the same may be included as part of indicators for the

scheme.

**Effectiveness**

• A study conducted by the Indian Council of Food and Agriculture (ICFA) showed that

farmers have an increase in income ranging from 24.5% to 70.5%, with an average

increase in income of about 46.8% after micro irrigation systems adoption in different

states.

• It may be noted that out the total area covered under micro-irrigation during 2015-2020,

about 75% of the area has been covered in Karnataka (18.11%), Andhra Pradesh

(17.50%), Gujarat (17.31%), Maharashtra (12.3%) and Tamil Nadu (9.53%). Therefore,

the implementation of interventions have been concentrated to certain states. The scheme

may engage with other states as well to ensure effectiveness of interventions across the

country.

• A dedicated team to support micro irrigation on field for farmers is essential for the

scheme to be effective at ground level, as the absence of such team has been one of the

primary reasons for poor adoption of technology owing to lack of knowledge of the

benefits of micro irrigation system among farmers.

**Efficiency**

• The programme is able to achieve 75% of its physical targets from 2015-2019 while

achieving 100% of its targets in 2015-16 and 2016-17, thereafter the targets were raised

significantly. Though the achievement in 2017-18 and 2018-19 were higher than previous

years, the targets were not achieved.

• The financial outlay for PMKSY-PDMC has consistently increased since 2015-16. The BE

in 2018-19 is 4 times than that of 2015- 1 6. However, there has been significant reduction

every year between BE and RE.

• At the sectoral level, the overall potential of micro irrigation in India is projected to be

about 70 Mha (million hectares), however, the micro irrigation coverage achieved by 2018

was only around 9 Mha in 15 years^136. Therefore, at the current coverage rate of 0.6

(^136) Sectoral Paper on Water Resources (2018), NABARD

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Mha/annum, it would take approximately more than 100 years to achieve the potential

target of micro irrigation in India. There is need to promote and devote sufficient funds

under the scheme for achieving intended outcomes.

**Sustainability**

• Majority of the district and block officials of different states have advised to enhance

capacity building of both stakeholders, that is, beneficiaries and officials, on the operation

and maintenance of micro irrigation systems. The capacity of Water Users Associations

(WUAs) should be enhanced with the support of public and private sector to improve

water use efficiency by providing trainings on the operation and maintenance of MIS on

field. These aspects are important for sustainability of interventions implemented under

the scheme.

• Precision Farming Development Centres (PFDC) established in every state to promote

precision farming for hi-tech horticulture need to be strengthened and equipped to

function as training centres to impart training to higher numbers of farmers.

• After-sales services network needs to be strengthened for sustainability of the system

once adopted, as there are many instances of clogging of emitters, damage caused by

rodents, poor quality of products, high installation cost, poor after-sales service, delays in

loan and subsidy approvals, and lack of technical support which act as obstacles to

adoption of micro irrigation by the farmers.

**Impact**

• The periodicity of subsidy needs to be aligned to the life of micro irrigation system for

continued and maximized impact, as at many times the micro irrigation systems

distributed under the scheme do not last for full 10 years. This results in the situation

where the beneficiaries have to either wait for a few more years before they become

eligible for another round of subsidy or give up on using micro irrigation altogether.

• As highlighted above, there has been limited progress on coverage of micro irrigation

compared to sector's requirement which is a reflection of either insufficient funding or

inadequate implementation under the scheme for achieving intended outcomes.

• Impact of the scheme appears to be limited to a few states as five states account for 75%

of total area covered under the scheme. Major agrarian states like UP, Bihar, Haryana,

Punjab and to some extent Madhya Pradesh have limited coverage under the scheme.

Therefore, there is need to engage with states for effective implementation of the scheme

and enhanced impact.

• In states such as Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, it has been found that in the current

DBT model, the farmer is required to pay upfront cost of the micro irrigation system. In

this model, it is observed that usually 100% of the cost is to be paid in advance to micro

irrigation suppliers, which most farmers lack the ability or willingness to do so.

**Equity**

• Women farmers are encouraged to apply for this scheme and as per the scheme

guidelines, at least 50% of the allocation is utilized for small and marginal farmers, of

which at least 30% should be women beneficiaries/farmers. However, information on the

utilization of the allocated budget for women farmers was not available.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• KIIs revealed that one of the biggest reasons of low application coming from women

farmers stems from the fact that there are less women farmers who are owners of farm

land. There are no other support for promoting women participation.

• Under PMKSY-PDMC, there is a budget allocation mandatorily made for the Scheduled

Tribes and Scheduled Caste. However, information on the utilization of the allocated

budget under these sub-plans was not available.

Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas

i. Accountability and Transparency

The overarching scheme of PMKSY overlooks into activities under its 4 respective components

i.e., AIBP, PMKSY (Har Khet Ko Pani), PMKSY (Per Drop More Crop), PMKSY (Watershed

Development). The State Agriculture Department is assigned to be the Nodal Department for

implementation of PMKSY in order to ensure efficient delivery of services under all components.

The data collection on available and potential water resources and water requirement for

agriculture sector is made through the District Implementation Plan prepared by the District

Level Implementation Committee which is further consolidated as the State Implementation Plan.

District Irrigation Plans being the cornerstone of the scheme, the heads of the districts/ District

Magistrates are now directly responsible and accountable for the successful implementation of

this scheme, thus ensuring dedicated focus in preparing the DIPs. At the village level, the

Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) are endowed with the responsibility in implementing the

scheme. The Panchayati Raj Institutions are required to provide information on the available and

required water resources, identify beneficiary list and also perform social audits on the resource

usage. In order to maintain transparency in beneficiary selection, the scheme mandates the

implementing agency (i.e. the States) to ensure that selection of beneficiaries is done as per details

included in the Annual Action Plan for the component for the year which has been derived from

the DIP. The implementing agency is required to follows uniform procedures and full

transparency in selection of beneficiaries and release of assistance to the beneficiaries in an

efficient manner.

The State Level Sanctioning Committee chaired by the by the Chief Secretary of the State is

responsible for monitoring and reviewing the scheme including reviewing the activities of the

PRIs and ensure transparency in the scheme implementation. Various public awareness and

publicity efforts for engaging farmers, PRIs, media and other local stakeholders is carried out by

District Level Implementation Committee. The monitoring mechanism of the scheme needs to

capture the accountability of resources utilised and the same is maintained by the Nodal

department or the State Agriculture Department.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The subsidy being provided under the PMKSY - Per Drop More Crop component is 55% for small

and marginal farmers and 45% for other categories.^137 The review of progress of PMKSY is

conducted frequently in alignment with other departments such as Department of Water

Resources. The monitoring of progress on Micro Irrigation activities under Per Drop More Crop

component is done on a web based platform for all states. From April 2017 onwards, all states

had been advised to link Aadhar based information system for all beneficiaries ensuring Aadhar

based registration. States like Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have adopted IT based

initiatives which has enabled real time monitoring of transactions for small and marginal farmers

including geo tagging of installed equipment^138. Automation of the implementation system

starting from application of MI projects, installation till claiming subsidy for the assets has proved

to be effective to ensure smooth operationalization of the scheme. A transparent and real-time

online monitoring system has been implemented by Andhra Pradesh capturing the progress of

various activities under Micro Irrigation. The goals of the Andhra Pradesh Micro Irrigation Project

(APMIP) has been aligned with the Central scheme PMKSY. The interactive monitoring application

under APMIP is also enabled with mechanism to capture geo-coordinates of micro-irrigation

structures along with photos and communicate the same with beneficiary farmers. This system

also sets the provision of receiving farmer’s complaints online and route escalation thus

expediting the successful implementation of the projects undertaken. Subsidy disbursal to micro-

irrigation infrastructure companies is also ensured through the online mechanism. The web-

based registration, monitoring and subsidy disbursal mechanism implemented by the state of

Gujarat also is an efficient IT system. It enables preparation of geo-fencing based design and cost

estimate preparation.

The subsidies transferred for the beneficiaries under this scheme are routed through the Direct

Benefit Transfer. The states which have implemented Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme to

approve subsidies have been reporting the beneficiaries through the DBT portal^139. However a

significant beneficiary details is not captured through the DBT report since several states have

not yet implemented the scheme and among the states implementing the scheme there has not

been 100% coverage under DBT.

In order to ensure transparency at the beneficiary transfer level, the Implementing agency needs

to follow uniform procedure to select beneficiaries and efficiently release assistance to them.

Enlisting of beneficiaries are open round the year for availing the benefit of financial assistance

under the scheme. It is recommended as per the PMKSY –Per Drop More Crop Guidelines that all

state implementing agency need to adopt a web based IT model for implementation of the scheme

which would ensure efficiency of the system. The selection of beneficiaries is derived from the

District Implementation Plan which is incorporated in the Annual Action Plan.

The scheme has well-functioning RTI mechanism in place. Since most of the beneficiary

information is published online there has been a significant reduction in the response time

required to address the filed RTIs.^140

Under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme component, gaps and deficiencies in

conducted proper survey and planning have been reported in a Performance Audit of AIBP

projects from 25 states.^141 The issues examined in the audit reported insufficient monitoring visits

by the Central Water Commission (CWC). The state level committees were not formed in all states

which further led to reduced efforts on monitoring from the states.

Deficiencies in the planning, implementation and monitoring of the programme were examined

to reveal insufficiencies in preparation and processing of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) such as

inadequate surveys, inaccurate assessment of water availability, Irrigation Potential (IP) and

Command Area, lack of activity wise construction plans, etc. and incorrect calculation of Benefit

Cost Ratio of the projects. Deficiency in DPRs were reported in several MI Schemes implemented

in Arunanchal Pradesh, and Nagaland; lift irrigation activities in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra,

Telangana; canal and barrage construction activities in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and

Maharashtra.

Inefficiency in financial management accounted for issues such as non/short release of funds,

delays in release of funds at various levels, releases at the fag-end of the financial year and non-

adjustment of unutilised balance of funds in the subsequent releases. It also included issues

around non submission of utilization certificates by state agencies to the Ministry.

PMKSY had transferred benefits to 646742 farmers across the country. The detailed summary of

the state-wise beneficiary details has been given below. The table provides information for

PMKSY, the portal does not have segregated information of beneficiaries under separate

iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient

practices & diversifications

Micro Irrigation is one of the most efficient mechanisms to enable sustainable agriculture

practices through drip irrigation, sprinklers, pivot, rain-guns etc. since it promotes precision

farming by making water available in a targeted manner to the root zone of crops. It is

recommended to be installed in command areas of irrigation replacing the flood irrigation where

water is lost in conveyance. Micro irrigation is a sustainable measure by enabling water savings

upto 40 per cent over conventional flood irrigation, crop and income enhancement to the extent

of approximately 47 per cent and 48 per cent respectively^143. This mechanism also helps in soil

health management and enhance nutrient efficiency. Further to improve the productivity of crops,

fertigation is practiced in the areas irrigated though micro irrigation techniques which maximises

the benefit of micro irrigation. The PMKSY- per drop more crop scheme component mandates the

use of a fertigation device by the farmers such as venturi injector or fertilizer tank on which the

subsidy is available.^144 Usage of fertigation enhances the nutrient availability in the soil and the

fertilizer use efficiency is observed to increase by 80-90 per cent.^145

One of the major challenges in realizing the full irrigation potential is the farm power availability

which has to be met out with the grid connection or rely on diesel and other fossil fuels. Replacing

the fossil fuel source with renewable energy like solar pumping units has been able to address the

mismatch of demand and supply of energy across states. A 2000 Watt Peak (WP) solar water

pump can potentially irrigate 1 hectare land with

regular crops by pumping approximately 80,000 litres

of water per day from a source that is up to 10 meters

deep. States like Rajasthan and Gujarat have been using

solar water pumping system in drip and sprinkler

irrigation in crops like rice, wheat and seed cotton since

1.  The estimated agricultural value added (% of

GDP) post implementation of solar power irrigation in

Rajasthan has been 17.4%^147. Driven by the state

subsidy scheme on solar PV pumping systems to

farmers across the state, the agricultural productivity

has increased considerably. The state has realised the results though mobilizing small-scale

farmers, women and youth in innovative solar cooperatives which provides water and even sells

excess energy to the grid. The integration of micro irrigation with some of the new schemes under

Ministry of Renewable Energy framed offer financial and water security to farmers would be

beneficial to the agriculture sector in realising higher productivity though sustainable

mechanisms. The upcoming solar irrigation scheme promotes installation of grid-connected solar

power plants and solar pumps with a target to add 25,750 MW of combined solar capacities (all

three components) by the year 2022.^148 Micro irrigation implementation is prioritised in districts

and blocks which are water scarce, water stressed and critical in terms of ground water

availability.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the scheme

in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

Under the PMKSY- Per Drop More Crop scheme component, there is a budget allocation

mandatorily made for the Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Caste. 16.5% and 8.5% of the total

fund allocation is allocated for the Tribal Sub Plan and 16.5% and 8.5% of the total fund allocation

is allocated for the Scheduled Caste Sub Plan under this component (or in proportion of SC/ST

population in the district). However, information on the utilization of the allocated budget under

these sub-plans was not available.

The HH Survey brings out the share of various social groups among the scheme beneficiary

households.

vi. Stakeholder and Beneficiary Behavior Change

Awareness among the farmers about the economic and revenue-related benefits of micro

irrigation is one of the key efforts that would increase the adoption rate. However the maximum

benefits of this scheme can be reaped by integrating it with several other sustainable agriculture

practices such as improved soil health management, selection of suitable crops and water

harvesting. The cropping pattern of the country does not consider water requirement of crops.

Cultivation of water intensive crops in the water stressed states like Maharashtra, and Cauvery

basin can crop failures. Shifting towards less water intensive crops such as pulses, millets,

vegetables, legumes, oilseeds, and medicinal plants, save large quantities of freshwater.

Increasing water use efficiency is one of the primary objectives of the protective irrigation

measures taken under the scheme. However, Government provides farmers with free or

subsidised power to pump water, which many times does not promote the judicious use of water

among farmers. It is difficult to incentivise farmers to adopt efficient methods of irrigation and

aim for conservation of water. To address such challenges it is critical to promote awareness on

the fast depletion of groundwater as well as surface water.

Financial assistance for installation of micro irrigation system under the scheme is limited to 5 Ha

per individual beneficiary. Additionally each beneficiary can avail subsidy for micro irrigation for

a particular farm once in 7 years considering the period as the projected life of the micro irrigation

system. In case of Cooperative/group farming or Water User Associations, individual beneficiary

will receive financial assistance only through the respective organizations with in the overall

ceiling of 5 ha per beneficiary. The support in implementation, demonstration and training is

provided through institutions like PFDCs, ICAR, CIPET, ATMA and other reputed NGOs.

The subsidy allowance estimated on the cost of infrastructure on drip irrigation and sprinkler

irrigation for areas/states with low penetration is higher than the standard indicative cost. States

like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Union Territories

have been recognized as states with low penetration with less presence of manufacturing

companies in these states leading to higher cost of transportation and higher maintenance cost.

Assistance for North Eastern and Hilly States is also revised since these states have a lesser

coverage of MI owing to difficult terrain. The pipe installation in hilly region is much difficult and

also requires comparatively larger length of pipes. The unit cost of micro irrigation systems is

taken 25% higher in these states.

Training assistance is also provided under the scheme for capacity building of all stakeholders

including farmers, entrepreneurs, field level workers, officers, micro irrigation technician and

farm pond lining technicians. Provisions of conducting trainings programs, exposure visits of

stakeholders and study tours of technical staff/ field functionaries are drawn under the scheme.

vii. Unlocking Synergies with other Government Programmes

The primary objective of the umbrella PMKSY programme is to achieve convergence of

investments in irrigation at the field level, through preparation of district and sub-district level

water use plans. The each plan caters and aligns itself with the following components of the

overarching scheme.

• Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP)

• PMKSY (Har Khet ko Pani)

• PMKSY (Watershed development)

The scheme gives flexibility in planning of interventions and highlights the need to develop

location specific interventions in line with the district and state irrigation plans. As per the

guidelines, the overall responsibility of programme management, preparation of state/ district

plan, approval of annual plan, monitoring, promoting efficient water conveyance and precision

water application, topping up input cost particularly under civil construction through MGNREGS,

construction of micro irrigation structures to supplement source creation activities including tube

wells and dug wells, construction of secondary storage structures at tail end of canal system to

store water, Capacity building, training and extension etc. lies with PMKSY-PDMC component

implemented by Department of Agriculture.

The PMKSY–PDMC activities are expected to be implemented in-line with the ongoing major and

medium irrigation projects under AIBP and water harvesting and ground water recharge

interventions under PMKSY (Har Khet ko Paani). The scheme activities require synergies with

activities like creation of water harvesting storage structures (ponds, tanks, check dams, injection

wells etc.) and related afforestation/in-situ moisture conservation schemes in over

exploited/critical underground water zones to recharge aquifers. Creation of such water

harvesting structures planned under the rest of the components of PMKSY as well as under

Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and Integrated

Watershed Development Programme (IWDP) needs to be well integrated with drip and sprinkler

irrigation plans.

Funding under related activities in MGNREGA can be suitably utilised for on ground

implementation of MI and irrigation networks realising the overall objective of the scheme.

Participatory Irrigation

Management and Water User

is one of the key strategies to ensure

integrated micro irrigation project

implementation. Effective

implementation of Participatory

to effective and economic

maintenance of irrigation

infrastructure, improved

water, increase in irrigated area,

freedom of crop planning, effective

use of surface and groundwater,

increased cost recovery, and higher

income to farmers. Presence of

competent local leadership,

collective action from farmers, and access to knowledge on water use and crop selection can

ensure a sustainable participatory irrigation management. Creation of Water User Associations

help in bringing in the collective action to promote economy in water use and preservation of the

system. Some of the integrated micro irrigation projects practising participatory management in

the country are Narmada (Sinchor) Rajasthan (Govt. of Rajasthan), Mission Kakatiya (Government

of Telangana) and Micro Irrigation Scheme, Gujarat (Gujarat Green Revolution Company Ltd).

Private Public Partnership Model in Integrated Micro Irrigation : As envisaged by NITI

Aayog^149 , the current target of achieving 0.5 million Ha per annum coverage under MI with a

budget of just INR 1000 crore (USD 156 million) in PMKSY would take 100 years to reach the

overall MI potential in India. With the current state of insufficient infrastructure for micro

irrigation, the sector can attract financial and operation and maintenance (O&M) support from

private players. NITI Aayog has come up with the recommendation in its “Draft concept paper on

PPP in Micro Irrigation” to implement Public Private Partnership in the Integrated Micro

Irrigation projects to secure private capital and technology, functional and technical efficiency

and achieve economies of scale benefiting the engaged farmers. Learnings from other developing

countries have showed how public schemes have been unable to recover costs from farmers at a

level sufficient to cover the O&M costs, let alone make a return on the investment. The PPP model

on Integrated Micro Irrigation (PPP-IMI) recommended requires to be implemented under an

organized participatory farming framework which would help in achieving economies of scale^150

The Narmada (Sanchore) project in Rajasthan is one of the  
successful case of using micro irrigation through  
Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) during the  
period 2013-14. In this intervention implemented by  
Government of Rajasthan, use of micro irrigation  
technology like sprinkler and drip irrigation were mandated.  
Enforcement of Participatory Irrigation Management was  
made under which 2236 Water Users Association (WUA)  
were formed for effective water management. Activities  
included bio drainage in command area and tree plantation  
along the 1570 km length of canal, selection of salinity  
resistant crops. The sprinkler system helped in increase of  
Culturable Command Area (CCA) increased from 1.35 Lac  
hectares to 2.46 hectares and has also addressed issues  
problems of salinity, soil moisture, drainage thus improving  
soil health. The food production has increased from 534 cr.  
to 1480 cr. i.e. by 946 cr. (277%) based on year 2013-14.  
20% of the area has been dedicated to growing Kharif crop  
in the modified project.

as well as invite active participation from beneficiaries. The farmers with access to sustainable

source of water^151 would form a Farmer Producer Company with the clause of 10Ha land ceiling

(per beneficiary member of the FPC), to be implemented under PPP-IMI. Farmers, after a

concession period of 15 years, would bear all the operation and maintenance costs, as fixed by the

private player and the government. At the end of the concession period, farmers would have to

transfer their input subsidies from the government to private players to sustain the irrigation

infrastructure. Under this proposed model it is expected to increase the MI coverage and at the

same time obtaining the objective of effective and efficient way of distributing canal water

homogeneously across farms to the farmers.

Issues and Challenges

Some of the major issues and challenges in the scheme are as follows:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The scheme has mandated Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for all eligible beneficiaries.  
    However, all the implementing states have not been able to implement DBT across all its  
    mapped beneficiaries.
2.  Progress of the scheme is limited to few states: Impact of the scheme appears to be limited  
    to few states as five states account for more than 75% of total area covered under the  
    scheme. Major agrarian states like UP, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab and to some extent Madhya  
    Pradesh have limited coverage under the scheme^152.
3.  There is lack of involvement of the private sector to enter/ get involved in Participatory  
    Integrated Micro-Irrigation Management.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  Shortfalls in funds for the scheme^153 : It is noted that between 2015-16 and 2018-19, the  
    funds for the scheme were brought down every year from budgeted allocation to RE by 12-  
    15%, this has resulted in shortfall of funds for the program. Additionally, the current  
    funding under this scheme is unable to keep up with increasing demand in some states.
2.  Poor adoption of micro-irrigation^154 : Many factors such as localised farming, complexity of  
    designs, fragmented landholding, low awareness and lack of access to credit, lead to poor  
    adoption of micro-irrigation among farmers

Retrieved from [http://oar.icrisat.org/](http://oar.icrisat.org/)

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  The scheme progressed well in its initial years but its growth has slowed down. The  
    working group report of NITI Aayog^155 on crops, livestock, fisheries and agriculture inputs  
    also highlighted concerns on progressive negative growth in micro-irrigation particularly  
    in the adoption of sprinklers as an area of concern. The focus on micro irrigation may have  
    been affected after the integration of micro irrigation component under the overarching  
    Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PMKSY). However, the performance of the scheme  
    improved in 2019-20, where it achieved 87.2% of its financial targets and 90.6% of its  
    physical targets for Micro-irrigation.

C. Convergence with other schemes

1.  _Convergence with Other Water Harvesting Programs:_ Per Drop More Crop component is  
    one of the aspects of the larger scheme Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojana and it is  
    designed to be well integrated with the other components under the scheme. The  
    irrigation measures taken under PDMC is required to be well aligned with components  
    like Watershed Development’ which mandates infrastructure creation and development  
    for irrigation projects, as a part of the Command Area Development & Water Management  
    (“CADWM”) program.

In the similar way. Per Drop More Crop component needs to be aligned with the target of

Har Khet Ko Pani which intends to create assured irrigation access for all villages. Districts

which have little access to pump irrigation has very low potential for developing a robust

micro irrigation system, since access to irrigation is a precondition for adopting micro-

irrigation. Additionally, there is a gradual move to introduce micro-irrigation in canal

commands with reconfigured distribution systems of having piped transport under

pressure replacing open channel water transport. However, this requires different

departments to work at tandem at the ground level which is a gap at the moment.

1.  Widespread power outages and unscheduled interruptions across rural have been one of  
    primary reasons acting as a disincentive for farmers to adopt technology-intensive micro-  
    irrigation system. The persistent energy crisis affects drawal of groundwater in arid and  
    semi-arid regions. Promotion of micro-irrigation needs to go hand in hand with energy  
    supply or find convergence with renewable energy projects^156.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  Indicators do not cover impact on water use efficiency and productivity^157 : While the state

E. Others

1.  The scheme component PDMC have been observed to have not been able to benefit the  
    small and marginal farmers fully since the financial assistance do not cover the re-  
    procurement of drip and sprinkler system in the event of the system becoming obsolete  
    before the stipulated period of next assistance. This makes the technology unsustainable  
    for the poor farmers.^159
2.  In addition the area ceiling limit of 5 Ha is further restricting from increasing the micro  
    irrigation potential among the farmers investing in this infrastructure.^160
3.  Promotion of micro-irrigation along with free supply of water in farms may act as an  
    impediment towards the objective of attaining water efficiency.

F. Capacity Building

1.  A hindrance for the poor adoption of technology is due to farmers’ preference for traditional  
    methods of irrigation owing to lack of knowledge of the benefits of micro irrigation system.
2.  There are many instances of clogging of emitters, damage caused by rodents, poor quality  
    of products, high installation cost, poor after-sales service, delays in loan and subsidy  
    approvals, and lack of technical support which act as obstacles to adoption of micro  
    irrigation by the farmers.
3.  In states such as Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, it has been found that in the current  
    DBT model, the farmer is required to pay upfront cost of the micro irrigation system. In this  
    model, it is observed that usually 100% of the cost is to be paid in advance to micro  
    irrigation suppliers, which most farmers lack the ability or willingness to do so.

On the basis of the discussion above, the summary of the scheme’s issues and challenges have

been given below:

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the key recommendations for the scheme:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  Complete implementation of Direct Benefit Transfer scheme by all states is required to  
    ensure full transparency in the fund transfers under the back ended capital subsidy. A  
    quarterly review on the progress may be initiated to engage more states.

realities. [http://www.globalwaterforum.org/2017/06/13/micro-irrigation-in-india-an-assessment-of-bottlenecks-and-realities/](http://www.globalwaterforum.org/2017/06/13/micro-irrigation-in-india-an-assessment-of-bottlenecks-and-realities/)  
(^160) TERI. 2019. Critical Policy Interventions to Fast Forward Micro Irrigation in India

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  Out the total area covered under micro-irrigation during 2015-2020, more than 95% of area  
    covered under micro-irrigation component of the scheme was covered by only 5 states i.e.  
    Karnataka (24.8%), Andhra Pradesh (19.98%), Gujarat (18.8%), Tamil Nadu (16.61%) and  
    Maharashtra (16.26%) during the period 2015- 2020161. This clearly indicates the need to  
    promote micro-irrigation in other states. Major agrarian states like UP, Punjab, Madhya  
    Pradesh, Haryana needs to be targeted, extensive extension exercises and demonstrations  
    can be carried out in these states to create awareness, other micro-irrigation, potential of  
    alternative technologies like laser drip irrigation systems needs to explored and promoted.  
    Micro irrigation implementation should be prioritized in districts and blocks which are  
    water scarce, water stressed and critical in terms of ground water availability.
2.  There is limited incentive for the private sector to enter/ get involved in Participatory  
    Integrated Micro-Irrigation Management at a scalable level which needs to be encouraged  
    by offering higher incentives and greater flexibility to private players.
3.  It was informed during KIIs that many at times, the micro irrigation systems distributed  
    under the scheme do not last for full 10 years. This results in the situation where the  
    beneficiaries have to either wait for a few more years before they become eligible for  
    another round of subsidy or give up on using micro irrigation altogether. Therefore, the  
    periodicity of subsidy needs to be aligned to the life of micro irrigation system for continued  
    and maximized impact.
4.  In order to ensure transparency at the beneficiary transfer level, the Implementing Agency  
    needs to follow uniform procedure to select beneficiaries and efficiently release assistance  
    to them. It is recommended that all state implementing agency should adopt a web based  
    IT model for implementation of the scheme which would ensure efficiency of the system.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  As mentioned in Sectoral Paper on Water Resources (2018) of NABARD, even though the  
    overall potential of micro irrigation in India is projected to be about 70 Mha (million  
    hectares), the micro irrigation coverage achieved by 2018 was only around 9 Mha in 15  
    years. Therefore, at the current coverage rate of 0.6 Mha/annum, it would take  
    approximately more than 100 years to achieve the potential target of micro irrigation in  
    India. This shows there has been limited progress on coverage of micro irrigation compared  
    to sector's requirement which is a reflection of either insufficient funding or inadequate  
    implementation under the scheme for achieving intended outcomes. Therefore, reasons for  
    non-utilization of funds by states needs be addressed through consultations and in addition  
    it should be ensured that the states do not face the short fall of funds in implementation of  
    scheme activities. With further increase in adoption of micro irrigation practices, scalable  
    PPP models can be considered to supplement the funding requirement.
2.  In spite of the well-known benefits of modern irrigation methods such as surface or sub-  
    surface drip and sprinkler irrigation systems, they are not widely adopted on large scale by  
    farmers because of high capital cost, non-reliable sources of water for the system, marginal  
    and scattered agricultural landholdings, unavailability of subsidy at the required time or  
    the delayed release of funds for installation of micro irrigation system that have already

(^161) The data includes achievement of 2019-20 as accessed on 22/06/2020.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

been approved. Therefore, it is important to simplify and provide easy financing

mechanisms for farmers.

1.  It is observed that both financial and physical achievements of the scheme declined when  
    targets were significantly increased after the initial success. Therefore a careful assessment  
    of targets needs to be done. Different strategy has to be developed to achieve success in  
    states where micro-irrigation has not took off, moreover non achievement of SWMA targets  
    in states have to be reassessed. Awareness generation about the benefits of micro-irrigation  
    and the additional support that is being provided by States needs to be publicized more  
    among the farmers. Implementation strategy of successful states like Karnataka and Tamil  
    Nadu can be assessed for improvement in non-performing states, success stories can be  
    collected from these states and demonstrated to farmers in other states.

C. Convergence with other schemes

1.  At the village level, convergence of various activities under each component of PMKSY is to  
    be realized through increased communication between different departments. Often the  
    water requirement of the agriculture sector is given lower priority in comparison to other  
    uses of water while building the water harvesting structures. This calls for a better cohesion  
    between concerned departments to serve the key objectives of the scheme.

Creation of water harvesting structures planned under the components of PMKSY as well

as under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and

Integrated Watershed Development Programme (IWDP) needs to be well integrated with

drip and sprinkler irrigation plans.

1.  The integration of micro irrigation with the new schemes under Ministry of Renewable  
    Energy framed offer financial and water security to farmers would be beneficial to the  
    agriculture sector in realizing higher productivity though sustainable mechanisms. The  
    upcoming solar irrigation scheme promotes installation of grid-connected solar power  
    plants and solar pumps with a target to add 25,750 MW of combined solar capacities (all  
    three components) by the year 2022.

D. Monitoring and Evaluation

1.  The output and outcome indicators largely cover the intended objectives and various  
    components of the scheme. However, the outcome indicators may also include certain  
    parameters on level of awareness/ adoption of practices by farmers as well as impact of MI  
    on water use efficiency and productivity. It is suggested that an outcome indicator of  
    savings in water consumption as a direct measure of water use efficiency can be included.
2.  The structure once established under the scheme needs to be monitored and maintained,  
    cost norms and guidelines can be developed for their management;
3.  The programme achieved 100% of its targets in 2015-16 and 2016-17, thereafter the  
    targets were raised significantly. Though the achievement in 2017-18 and 2018-19 were  
    higher than previous years, the targets were not achieved. Thereafter the performance  
    improved in 2019-20 when the targets were rationalized. Therefore, process of setting  
    targets needs be checked, capacity of implementing states also have been while setting  
    targets

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

E. Others

1.  The financial assistance has to be modified so that it can cover the re-procurement of the  
    system in case it becomes obsolete, it will help in better coverage of the scheme among  
    small and marginal farmers^162
2.  An increase in the ceiling area may be considered for better realisation of the benefits under  
    this scheme.^163
3.  A system of farm water metering can be implemented to assess the water usage of farms  
    using micro irrigation. In addition, the cultivation of water intensive crops should also be  
    discouraged for utilising the benefits of micro-irrigation

F. Capacity Building

1.  A dedicated team to support micro irrigation on field for farmers is essential for the scheme  
    to be effective at ground level.
2.  After-sales services network needs to be strengthened for building confidence of  
    beneficiaries for adopting micro irrigation.
3.  As highlighted above, a dedicated team to support micro irrigation on field for farmers is  
    essential for sensitizing farmers about benefits of micro irrigation and guide them for  
    opting for loans, specifically for installation of micro irrigation.
4.  Majority of the district and block officials of different states have advised to enhance  
    capacity building of both stakeholders, that is, beneficiaries and officials, on the operation  
    and maintenance of micro irrigation systems. The capacity of Water Users Associations  
    (WUAs) should be enhanced with the support of public and private sector to improve water  
    use efficiency by providing trainings on the operation and maintenance of MIS on field.
5.  The networks of Precision Farming Development Centers (PFDC) that have been  
    established are available in every state to promote precision farming for hi-tech  
    horticulture need to be strengthened and equipped to function as training centers to impart  
    training to large numbers of farmers.
6.  Awareness among the farmers about the economic and revenue-related benefits of micro  
    irrigation is one of the key efforts that would increase the adoption rate.

(^163) TERI. 2019. Critical Policy Interventions to Fast Forward Micro Irrigation in India

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

Water is one of the most important resources in agriculture. As per Central Water

Commission, 85.3% of the total water consumed in India was for agriculture in 2000 and is

likely to reduce to 83.3% by 2025. India is currently a water deficient nation with estimated

per capita availability of 1400 cubic meters in 2018.

PMKSY’s main objective is to achieve convergence of investment in irrigation for improving

on-farm water use efficiency and it focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level

through micro irrigation. Besides promoting precision irrigation and better on-farm water

management practices to optimize the use of available water resources, this component

also supports micro level water storage or water conservation/management activities.

Therefore, the scheme is highly relevant for promoting water conservation and improving

on-farm water use efficiency.

2.2.2 Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna (RKVY-RAFTAAR)

Background of the Scheme

The Rasthtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) was approved in 2007, with an aim to ensure holistic

development of agriculture and allied sectors by allowing states to choose their own agriculture

and allied sector development activities as per the district/state agriculture plan. Under RKVY,

States have been provided flexibility and autonomy for selection, planning approval and

execution of projects/programs under the scheme as per their need, priorities and agro-climate

requirements^164.

Till 2013-14, the scheme was implemented as an Additional Central Assistance (ACA) to State

Plan Scheme with 100% central assistance. It was converted into a Centrally Sponsored Scheme

in 2014-15 with 100% central assistance. Since 2015-16, the funding pattern of the scheme has

been altered in the ratio of 60:40 between Centre and States (90:10 for North Eastern States and

Himalayan States). For Union Territories the funding pattern is 100% central grant.

In 2017, the Cabinet approved the continuation of the ongoing Centrally Sponsored Scheme -

Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) as **Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana- Remunerative**

**Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sector Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR)** for three

years i.e. 2017-18 to 2019-20 with a financial allocation of Rs.15,722 crores with broad objectives

of making farming a remunerative economic activity through strengthening the farmer’s effort,

risk mitigation and promoting agri-business entrepreneurship.

The scheme incentivizes States to increase public investment in agriculture & allied

sectors. Under RKVY, States have been provided flexibility and autonomy for selection, planning

approval and execution of projects/programs under the scheme as per their need, priorities and

agro-climate requirements.

**Objectives of RKVY- RAFTAAR**

• To strengthen the farmers’ efforts through creation of required pre and postharvest agri-

infrastructure that increases access to quality inputs, storage, market facilities etc. and

enables farmers to make informed choices.

• To provide autonomy, flexibility to states to plan and execute schemes as per local/

farmers’ needs.

• To promote value chain addition linked production models that will help farmers increase

their income as well as encourage production/productivity

• To mitigate risk of farmers with focus on additional income generation activities - like

integrated farming, mushroom cultivation, bee keeping, aromatic plant cultivation,

floriculture etc.

• To attend national priorities through several sub-schemes.

• To empower youth through skill development, innovation and agri entrepreneurship

based agribusiness models that attract them to agriculture.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The scheme covers the following allied sectors:

• Crop Husbandry

• Horticulture

• Fisheries

• Dairy Development

• Agricultural Research and Education

• Forestry and Wildlife

• Plantation

• Agricultural Marketing

• Food Storage and Warehousing

• Soil and Water Conservation

• Agricultural Financial Institution

• Irrigation Activities

**Implementation structure and stakeholders**

Under this scheme, funds are released to the State Governments/UTs on the basis of District

Agriculture Plans (DAP) and State Agriculture Plans (SAP). The DAPs and SAPs should focus on

agriculture as well as the allied sectors.

A State Level Project Screening Committee (SLPSC) is constituted by each State for screening

RKVY-RAFTAAR project proposals, which will be headed by the Agriculture Production

Commissioner or any other officer nominated by the Chief Secretary. The SLPSC reviews all

proposals for their viability and ensure that they flow from the District Agriculture Plan / State

Agriculture Plan/ State Agriculture Infrastructure Development Programme (SAIDP). The viable

projects are forwarded to State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) headed by the Chief

Secretary of the State. The SLSC can either approve or reject a proposal based on its assessment.

The SLSC is also responsible for implementation and monitoring of each project sanctioned by it

under each stream of RKVY- RAFTAAR.

For implementation of the scheme, the State Department of Agriculture will be the nodal agency.

However, for administrative convenience, the state governments may establish an exclusive

agency for implementing the scheme on fast-track basis. Even where such an agency exists, the

end responsibility of ensuring implementation rests with the state Department of Agriculture.

Following is an illustration of the implementation mechanism under RKVY.

**Intended contribution to sectoral performance**

RKVY-RAFTAAR aims to make agriculture a remunerative activity. A unique feature in the scheme

is that it focusses not only on agriculture, but also allied sectors like animal husbandry, dairy, and

fisheries, horticulture, agricultural research and education, agriculture marketing, etc. The

scheme acknowledges the differences in requirements at regional level, hence it gives autonomy

to states to plan their schemes as per the needs of the farmers in their regions. The scheme

encourages the stakeholders to draw DAPs and SAPs by incorporating information on local

requirements, geographical/ climatic conditions, available natural resources/ technology and

cropping patterns in their districts/ states so as to significantly increase the productivity of

Agriculture and its allied sectors and eventually maximize the returns of farmers in agriculture

and its allied sectors. The scheme seeks to contribute to income generation activities for farmers,

value addition in production, and creation of pre-and post-harvest infrastructure.

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

The scheme contributes to national development agenda by focussing on doubling farmers’

income by creating a policy environment that enables income security for farmers, whilst

maintaining India’s food security. The scheme aims to develop a policy platform to incentivize the

states so as to increase public investment in agriculture and allied sectors and to provide

flexibility and autonomy to states in the process of planning and executing agriculture and allied

sector schemes. Further, it also ensures that preparation of agriculture plans for the districts and

the states are based on its particular agro-climatic conditions, technology and natural resources.

The scheme contributes to UN SDG’s goal of Zero Hunger, and No Poverty. The scheme aims at

increasing production and yield by addressing them in a holistic manner through area-specific

training and demonstrations, and giving flexibility to districts and states to prepare plans based

on their agro-climatic conditions, availability of technology and natural resources. Further, one of

the key objectives of RKVY- RAFTAAR is to make agriculture a remunerative practice, and mitigate

risk of farmers with focus on additional income generation activities (integrated farming,

mushroom cultivation, bee keeping, floriculture etc.), thus contributing to No Poverty goal. The

scheme thus correlates to following SDGs:

**Observations**^165

• RKVY has been able to attain over 100% utilization of funds since 2015-16. However, it

hasn’t seen a consistent rise in Budget Expenditure or Revised Expenditure.

• RKVY was successful in motivating states to pay greater attention to agriculture, besides

providing increased Central assistance for the sector^166.

• Projects amounting to over Rs. 5000 crore were sanctioned under RKVY for Animal

Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries sectors during 11th Plan. This has provided a

substantial push to these sectors, which account for a significant contribution to the

Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

(^165) Independent evaluation carried out by National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD) Hyderabad  
(^166) Institute of Economic Growth, Concurrent evaluation of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana for 2016- 17

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The Institute of Economic Growth (IEG)^167 conducted an independent evaluation of RKVY to

assess the stated objectives of the programme. 10% of the sanctioned projects of year 2016- 17

were studied in detail using information collected from both agricultural households and

implementing agencies. The report concluded the following:

• Marginal and small farmers are the primary beneficiaries (consistently across states)

• A comparison of average household income per acre between beneficiary and non-

beneficiary households indicates positive impact of RKVY on average household income

in more than fifty per cent of the states

• Major constraints faced by beneficiaries include delay in subsidy payment, lack of

marketing support, and lack of monitoring

• While farmers found the scheme to be helpful in employment generation, production,

financial assistance, and marketing facilities, the scheme left them wanting more in terms

of procurement, post-harvest management, capacity building and creation of rural

infrastructure. Based on the observations in 2016- 17 , the scheme has shifted its focus on

post-harvest and rural infrastructure development since 2017-18, it has supported

multiple post-harvest and cold chain infrastructure projects in states like Andhra Pradesh,

Karnataka, Maharashtra in line with State Agricultural Plan. In addition RKVY has also

been supporting development of animal husbandry, fisheries and milk processing

infrastructure and value chain development (details provided in NPDD scheme analysis).

• Many states are shifting their focus from production growth to infrastructure creation,

such as, cold storages, warehouses, custom hiring centres, and micro irrigation and dairy

plants.

• Convergence of infrastructure-related projects, with other schemes was found in only few

states.

• Geo-tagging of infrastructure projects is yet to be undertaken in many states, mainly due

to poor internet connectivity, inadequate human resource, lack of funds, and insufficient

skills.

• The scheme’s most noteworthy characteristic is that it gives states the flexibility to

operate as per its needs, and hence has an effective policy for implementation. This has

resulted in effective targeting of beneficiaries, and increase in household incomes in most

states.

Data on outcomes targets is not available for the scheme.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• RKVY-RAFTAAR aims at making farming a remunerative economic activity through

strengthening the farmer effort, risk mitigation and promoting agri-business

entrepreneurship. Thus, it focuses on coverage of diverse range of agri and allied sector

activities from production to marketing. Besides, the flexibility and autonomy provided

under the scheme to the state and district level agencies in planning, selection, approval

and execution of projects/programs is helping in identifying and co-evolving solutions to

address the local needs.

• Through the Public Private Partnership for Integrated Agriculture Development

(PPPIAD), the Scheme also intends to facilitate large scale integrated agriculture and allied

sectors projects led by private sector players with aim to integrate the farmers in the agri-

supply chain. While this component the Scheme offers complete flexibility to the private

player in designing of the project, however, concurrently the component also emphasizes

on ensuring an integrated value chain approach i.e. covering all aspects from production

to marketing. As per the guidelines, each such project must feature mobilization of

farmers into groups and their registration, technology infusion, value addition, marketing

solution and project management. Thus eliminating participation for development of

individual components of the value chain. Also the desirable benchmark to quantify the

average investment is pegged at minimum of Rs. 100,000 per farmer in each project

leading to a very high investment cost for the project thus making it difficult for FPOs/

farmer groups and even corporates to participate in the scheme. Therefore, it is

recommended that these requirements be eased further to make the scheme more

relevant for participation by smaller players and farmer collectives and encouraging their

involvement, particularly to sustain scheme interventions.

• It may be noted that there is significant scope for convergence of the scheme with other

central and state level initiatives for better implementation and avoiding duplication. For

example, the interventions related to horticulture crop value chain development may be

integrated with the MIDH Scheme and Schemes under Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA

Yojana.

**Effectiveness**

• The scheme’s most noteworthy characteristic is that it gives states the flexibility to

operate as per its needs, and hence has an effective policy for implementation. This has

resulted in effective targeting of beneficiaries, and increase in household incomes in most

states.

• Submission of utilization certificates by the states takes considerable time. This creates

unnecessary delay in implementation of the scheme. The whole process of approval of

proposals, release and subsequent transfer of funds, revision of proposals and utilization

reporting, etc. need to be streamlined to reduce delays.

• While farmers found the scheme to be helpful in employment generation, production,

financial assistance, and marketing facilities, it was found lacking in addressing issues

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

related to procurement, post-harvest management, capacity building and creation of rural

infrastructure.

• Increased emphasis should be laid on encouraging participation of farmer groups to

facilitate cost-effective and greater extension coverage of intervention. In this context,

there is a potential of convergence with other large national level programmes such as

SFAC, NABARD and National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) to leverage their existing

database at the field level. These databases can be leveraged for identification of potential

beneficiaries and planning the outreach mechanisms.

• Regular awareness generation campaigns need to be undertaken to increase awareness

about the scheme at the grass-root level to sensitize and encourage participation of farmer

groups and private sector players.

**Efficiency**

• RKVY has been able to attain over 100% utilization of funds since 2015-16. However, it

hasn’t seen a consistent rise in Budget Expenditure or Revised Expenditure, even when

the scheme has been successful in motivating states to pay greater attention to

agriculture, besides providing increased central assistance for the sector.

• Measures should be taken to ensure timely contribution of state’s share of fund, to avoid

delays in expending funds. It will be beneficial if real-time progress tracking and data

monitoring mechanisms are established at state and district level for effective

implementation and efficient monitoring of the scheme.

• In many instances, the release of subsidy gets delayed. This delay affects the confidence

of the entrepreneurs/ beneficiaries in the scheme and also the funding institutions.

**Sustainability**

• The Scheme has decentralized and bottom-up approach in planning and implementation

to ensure that relevant and required projects taking into account the ground

requirements are prepared and approved. However, a well-defined exit strategy should

also be incorporated with a complementing budget. For example, development of direct

marketing linkages between farmers/ farmer groups and the private sector (processing

player/ organized retail/ e-commerce etc) is critical and must be emphasised upon.

Further, convergences with other central/ state schemes should also be considered for

better implementation and cost-effectiveness. For example, the strengthening of

production clusters under the RKVY scheme may be linked with forward infrastructure

support facilitated under the PPPIAD or other schemes such as the scheme for creation of

backward and forward linkage/ Cold Chain/ Agro-Clusters/ Mega Food Park etc.

• Development of marketing infrastructure needs to be supplemented with strengthening

of price discovery mechanisms, improved access to market information, linkages with e-

trading platforms, capacity building of the beneficiaries including farmers’ collectives and

other value chain actors on the aspects of quality standards and certifications, innovative

packaging & labelling techniques, branding support etc. particularly for organic labelling

and product exports.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Strengthening of farmer groups, SHG federations, FPO/ FPC with support under the

scheme through capacity building on business aspects and infrastructure assistance

should be prioritized for ensuring sustainability.

• The state budgeting should also incorporate an aspect for skill development and capacity

building of project management staff. Project management unit comprising subject matter

expert/ technical resource at the state and district level may also be considered.

**Impact**

• Projects amounting to over Rs. 5000 crore were sanctioned under RKVY for Animal

Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries sectors during 11th Plan. This has provided a

substantial push to these sectors, which account for a significant contribution to the

Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

• A comparison of average household income per acre between beneficiary and non-

beneficiary households indicates positive impact of RKVY on average household income

in more than 50% of the states.

• Geo-tagging of infrastructure projects is yet to be undertaken in many states, mainly due

to poor internet connectivity, inadequate human resource or lack of funds, this needs to

be prioritized for assessment of efficiency, effectiveness and impact of interventions being

implemented under the scheme.

• Awareness generation activities may be taken up more rigorously across states for greater

impact.

**Equity**

• RKVY guidelines stipulate that adequate coverage of women and other weaker sections of

the society should be ensured while selecting beneficiaries under any project of RKVY-

RAFTAAR. However, no special incentives or provisions are given to ensure participation

of marginalized groups and women.

• Therefore, provisioning adequate budget for gender mainstreaming is recommended

which may include specialized training, awareness campaigns etc. to encourage and

strengthen their participation in the sector.

• In addition, training and capacity building programs for the beneficiaries, certain

percentage of women participation may be mandated to promote gender mainstreaming.

• There is variation in scheme performance across different states. There is a need for more

distributed performance across states and accordingly more intense engagement with the

lagging states should be taken up.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas**

i. Accountability and transparency

Under this scheme, funds are released to the State Governments/UTs on the basis of District

Agriculture Plans (DAP) and State Agriculture Plans (SAP). A State Level Project Screening

Committee (SLPSC) screens the proposals and ensure that they flow from the District Agriculture

Plan / State Agriculture Plan/ State Agriculture Infrastructure Development Programme (SAIDP).

The viable projects are forwarded to State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) either approve or

reject a proposal based on its assessment. For implementation of the scheme, the State

Department of Agriculture is the nodal agency. RKVY-RAFTAAR Funds are made available to the

States in two instalments of 50% each.

The data has been captured well on RKVY website as well.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The scheme grants autonomy to states and districts on utilizing the funds on any activity

in agri & allied sectors, including dairying, crop husbandry, agri research & education,

fisheries, agri extension, etc.

• RKVY-Management Information System (RKVY-MIS) has been put in place as a web-based

MIS for RKVY to collect essential information related to each project. States are

responsible for timely submission/updating project data online in the system.

• Most of the information, including scheme guidelines, state and district action plans,

evaluation reports, year-wise allocation and expenditure, MIS reports, etc. are available

on public domain.

• The audit in the scheme is done by the CAG or the concerned Department (for which funds

have been allocated).

• No social audit has been conducted to date.

• Financial monitoring of progress of RKVY projects is done through field visits and

meetings.

• The states are mandated to evaluate at least 25% of the projects from an independent

third party.

• Monitoring also happens through MIS and geo-tagging (Geo-tagging has been done for

over 2.5 lac projects as of November 2019, according to scheme-level officers).

• There is a grievance mechanism in place; RTIs are encouraged

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• The scheme is not entirely beneficiary-oriented, hence not all transactions can be done

under DBT. However, benefits transfer to individual beneficiaries is done through DBT.

The HH Survey brings out the income increase among scheme beneficiaries. The graph below

depicts the same.

Figure 136 : RKVY - Income increase between 2015-16 and 2018- 19

Source: HH Survey, Deloitte Analysis

There has been a 33.15% increase in income among scheme beneficiaries from 2015-16 to 2018-

ii. Direct/Indirect employment generation

The Department does not maintain records for employment generated through projects

sanctioned by it.

iii. Gender mainstreaming

RKVY guidelines stipulate that it is the responsibility of SLSC to ensure that while selecting

beneficiaries under any project of RKVY-RAFTAAR, adequate coverage of women and other

weaker sections of the society is ensured. However, no other special incentives or provisions are

given to ensure women participation in the scheme.

As observed from the HH Survey the share of male and female workers in scheme beneficiary

households has been represented below.

iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient

practices & diversifications

Given that RKVY has convergence with other schemes, and can have more far-reaching impact

than a single scheme, provisioning for climate-friendly practices through the scheme may be

beneficial. While the scheme promotes climate resilient practices, there is no mandate for

complying with them.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The scheme encourages adoption of green practices but does not mandate any specific

activities, for climate sustainability.

• RKVY funds are permitted to be used for implementing solar energy in agriculture i.e.,

Solar pump sets, Solar dryers, solar energy in green house etc., under agriculture

mechanization.

• The funds may also be used for creation of greenhouse infrastructure (under

horticulture), and setting up of new soil testing and fertiliser quality control laboratories.

• Apart from these, sustainable agricultural practices specified under various schemes of

DAC&FW are eligible for financial assistance under RKVY.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the

scheme in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

RKVY guidelines stipulate that the SLSC ensure that while selecting beneficiaries under any

project of RKVY-RAFTAAR, adequate coverage of small and marginal farmers, Scheduled Castes,

Scheduled Tribes and other weaker segments of society is ensured so that the benefits of

implementation of a particular project or the scheme reach the intended beneficiaries. However,

no other special incentives or provisions are given to ensure their participation in the scheme.

The share of Social Groups among scheme beneficiary households has been presented based on

the HH Survey. The same has been depicted below.

vi. Use of IT/technology in driving efficiency

RKVY promotes and uses technology in multiple aspects. For instance, geo-tagging of projects, use

of MIS for project monitoring, seeking support from private players in technology infusion, and

coordination with ICAR/State Agriculture Universities to provide improved varieties of

seeds/seedlings and to introduce innovative technologies as required, among others.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The scheme aims to enhance production and productivity by adopting precision farming

techniques, protected cultivation, micro irrigation, etc.

• The scheme seeks support from private players to promote, develop, disseminate, and

mobilise technology.

• It also seeks support and cooperation of ICAR for provision of technology for value

addition in products, particularly for millets (breakfast cereal, biscuits, noodles, pasta,

etc.)

• Geo-tagging has been done for over 2.5 lac projects, as per scheme-level officials.

• The scheme is not entirely beneficiary-oriented, hence not all transactions can be done via

DBT. However, benefits transfer to individual beneficiaries is done through DBT.

• RKVY-Management Information System (RKVY-MIS) has been put in place as a web-based

MIS for RKVY to collect essential information related to each project. States are

responsible for timely submission/updating project data online in the system (preferably

on a fortnightly basis).

vii. Development, dissemination & adoption of innovative practices, technology & know-

how

The scheme has a unique feature of encouraging innovative practices through encouragement to

agri-entrepreneurship. 10% of the annual outlay under RKVY is earmarked for encouraging

innovation and agri-entrepreneurs through skill development and financial support. It also

supports incubates and incubation centers. Additionally, under the flexi funds component, states

can support projects as per their local needs preferably for innovative activities in agriculture and

allied sectors. The scheme also promotes coordination of ICAR/SAUs with private players for

providing improved varieties of seeds/seedlings and introducing innovative technologies.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• One of the key objectives of the scheme is to empower youth through skill development,

innovation and agri-entrepreneurship based agribusiness models that attract them to

agriculture.

• States can utilise RKVY funds for supporting innovative projects.

• The scheme offers financial support to incubatees / individual youth / farmers/ FPOs with

innovative ideas for setting up of agri businesses that will benefit farmers- empowerment

of small and medium Agri entrepreneurs.

• Some innovative projects have been funded under the scheme (see case study below).

Box 6 : Fodder Seed Production through RKVY

Case Study: Fodder seed production through RKVY in Uttar Pradesh

Introduction/Challenge:

Department of Animal Husbandry promotes breed improvement activities and fodder seed

cultivation in Varanasi, Jalaun, Hapur, Jhansi, Lucknow, Barabanki, Seetapur, Lalitput, Meerut and

Lakhimpur districts. The department has been facing multiple problems in upkeep of its facilities

and promoting fodder seed production due to paucity of funds. The area taken up for fodder seed

production was limited and land available with department was degrading, reducing productivity

and was converting into wastelands. This affected the department’s operations and overall apply

of good quality fodder seeds in the State. The lack of good quality fodder was also department’s

breed improvement programme as department provides good quality green fodder to farmers for

breeding and conception.

Solution:

Rs 172.3 crores were allocated for 2008- 2009 to 2016-2017 for promoting fodder seed

production and associated activities. The funds were spent on initiatives including land

restoration, strengthening of irrigation facilities, and rejuvenation of existing infrastructure for

rearing animals etc. The fodder crops promoted were Jwar, Barseem, Jai and Lobia

Impact:

• RKVY scheme provided much need financial aid to the department for strengthening its

operations, rejuvenation and restoration of land as well as infrastructure for upkeep of animals.

• Total area under fodder seed production increased by 473.26 Hectares in 2018- 19

• Led to increased fodder seed production of 45.86 Lakh Quintals in 12216 Hectares

• The overall green fodder production increased by nearly 4 times in 10 years as a result of

increase in area and improved production

• The green fodder production is sufficient for meeting daily green fodder need of 62,820

animals (@ 20kg per day per animal)

Improved availability green fodder is seen as critical for breed improvement, health and

productivity of milch animals, better availability of green fodder thus provided direct and indirect

benefits to livestock farmers.

viii. Stakeholder and Beneficiary behavioural change

An evaluation conducted by the Institute of Economic Growth^168 asserts that there has been a

notable shift in priorities in the sector post-RKVY. Since implementation of the scheme, the focus

of capital expenditure has shifted towards crop husbandry, animal husbandry, soil & water

conservation and food storage & warehousing in almost all states. The study also concluded that

RKVY is quite inclusive and a larger share of benefits are reaching the marginal and small farmers.

This can be judged from the fact that the average net income from agriculture is higher for

(^168) Institute of Economic Growth, Concurrent evaluation of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana for 2016- 17

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

beneficiary households as compared to non-beneficiary households in more than fifty per cent of

the states.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• KII discussions revealed that scheme-level officers that the change in grant pattern to

60:40 has diluted the core objective of RKVY, since states would have to bring-in

additional matching share for RKVY as well (which it has to do for other CSS already).

• The scheme has encouraged higher spend on allied sectors such as fisheries, dairying,

animal husbandry, etc.

• In terms of making agriculture a remunerative practice, the scheme offers various

marketing and post-harvest components which are eligible for financial assistance under

the scheme.

ix. Research & Development

The scheme promotes R&D through collaboration with ICAR. RKVY funds can also be used to fund

agricultural research infrastructure, and for strengthening Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs).

x. Unlocking synergies with other government programmes

Since the scheme is mandated to fill the gaps wherever existing in the field, RKVY-RAFTAAR

guidelines encourage convergence with schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural

Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY) and

Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF). States are also advised to ensure convergence with other

Central Schemes of Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (e.g. Department of Agriculture,

Cooperation & Farmers Welfare and Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries &

Department of Agriculture Research & Education) and other relevant Ministries/Departments

viz., Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Department

of Land Resources, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Water Resources etc. The

strategies for convergence of different schemes with RKVY is to be identified and decided by the

concerned state government, wherein, the central government may define a roadmap to enable

such convergences and encourage sharing of best practices among states.

xi. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives and civil

society in the scheme

RKVY-RAFTAAR promotes projects on PPP mode. It has a defined framework supporting Public

Private Partnership for Integrated Agriculture Development (PPPIAD). PPPIAD is a scheme for

facilitating large-scale integrated projects, led by private sector players in the agriculture and

allied sectors, with a view to aggregating farmers, providing additional income to farmers and

integrating the agricultural supply chain. This component allows corporates to propose

integrated agricultural development projects across the spectrum of agriculture and allied

sectors, taking responsibility for delivering all the interventions through a single window. Each

project to target at least 500 and above number of farmers, spread over the project life. Key

interventions of these projects include mobilizing farmers into producer groups, technology

infusion, value addition, marketing solutions, and project management. Financial assistance is

provided by State Governments directly to corporates through the RKVY-RAFTAAR window after

the project has been approved by SLSC, subject to a ceiling of Rs. 50,000 per farmer or 50% of the

proposed investment per farmer, whichever is lower.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The scheme is uniquely placed to attract more private funds in the sector.

• The private sector can combine its technological expertise with the on-ground knowledge

of farmers/producers to make agriculture sector more remunerative.

• Private players can partner with farmers and aid better price realization, for example,

grocery stores can collaborate with farmers directly, invest in cold chain infrastructure,

and sell fresh produce to consumers while enabling better prices for farmers.

• These players can also play a part in agri research.

• Private players have been investing in the sector under the scheme

Box 7 : Salinity Control in Coastal Regions of Gujarat

Case Study: Salinity control in coastal regions of Gujarat

Introduction/Challenge:

The land in selected coastal area is highly saline, the problem is further compounded by shallow

water table and frequent tidal inundation. The area also faced heavy rainfall during Kharif which

results in water logging that further impacts the soil health. High salinity affects agricultural

practices and productivity of land in coastal districts.

Solution:

Problematic areas in 15 coastal district of Gujarat were selected for intervention. 12, 100 hectare

of land has been selected for reclamation. The major interventions include construction of

structures for salinity prevention and ground water recharge and soil management for soil

reclamation. Project interventions were carried out on 4437 hectares in 2015-16, wherein 90

farm ponds, 41 water harvesting structures, 132 sim talwadi were constructed. In addition, 6

village ponds, 27 percolation tanks and 111002 RMT of reclamation bunds were also

constructed under this project.

Impact:

• Creation of water harvesting structures including ponds and percolation tanks helped in

ground water recharge

• Soil management practices helped in improving soil quality and better productivity, this has

helped in increasing area under Rabi crop and checking migration to some extent

• Construction of salinity prevention structures helped in preventing salinity ingress

• Fodder availability also increased which helped in boosting milk production

• The interventions had overall positive impact on farmers’ income

Issues and Challenges

Some of the major issues and challenges in the scheme are as follows:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  For implementation of the scheme, the State Department of Agriculture is the nodal agency.  
    Under this scheme, funds are released to the State Governments/UTs basis District  
    Agriculture Plans (DAP) and State Agriculture Plans (SAP). RKVY-RAFTAAR Funds are  
    made available to the States in two instalments of 50% each. The Ministry releases the funds  
    to the state, who in turn, releases funds to the implementing agency. Our discussions  
    highlighted that there have been delays in release of funds from the state to the  
    implementing agency as they are unable to bring their share of funds on time. This leads to  
    a delay in executing projects. It has been seen that some states delay their UCs, leading to  
    delays in subsequent release of funds. For example, funds released in 2018-19 amounted to  
    Rs. 3,370.34 crore, of this UCs were pending for Rs. 1,763.03 crore as of 8 November 2019.

2018 - 19 3600.00 3370.34 1607.31 1763.03

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  Previously, RKVY was on 100% central assistance wherein RKVY funds were released to  
    incentivize those states who were spending through their own funds on agri & allied  
    sectors. The RKVY scheme was meant as additional central assistance for the treasury of  
    these states who were already doing good work to promote agri. However, it was later  
    changed into a scheme with 60:40 pattern of assistance. Currently, funds are disbursed to

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

states who have been spending on agri & allied sectors from their budget for at least 3 years.

This, as per our discussions, has diluted the core objective of RKVY, since states would have

to bring-in additional matching share for RKVY as well (which it has to do for other CSS

already).

C. Convergence with other schemes

1.  Since the scheme is mandated to fill the gaps wherever existing in the field, RKVY-RAFTAAR  
    guidelines encourage convergence with schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural  
    Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana  
    (SGSY) and Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF). There is possibility of convergence with  
    state-level schemes as well. States are also advised to ensure convergence with other  
    Central Schemes of Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare and other relevant  
    Ministries/Departments viz., Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Ministry of New and  
    Renewable Energy, Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Rural Development,  
    Ministry of Water Resources etc.
2.  No clear roadmap is laid out to enable convergences. An evaluation conducted by the  
    Institute of Economic Growth also highlighted that the convergence of RKVY projects with  
    other schemes was found in only few states^169. For example, the Department of Agriculture  
    in Himachal Pradesh had implemented a project entitled ‘Diversified Agriculture through  
    Vegetable Cultivation’ in which the farmers were motivated for area expansion under  
    vegetables by providing assistance on seed and other related inputs under RKVY, whereas  
    the capacity building of vegetables growers has been done through the funds available  
    under Sub-Mission on Agricultural Extension.

On the basis of the discussion above, the summary of the scheme’s issues and challenges have

been given below:

(^169) Institute of Economic Growth, Concurrent evaluation of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana for 2016- 17  
**Key Reasons for Low Fund Utilization for Certain Components and Among  
States:**  
• It has been highlighted that the 60:40 pattern of the assistance has diluted the  
core objective of RKVY as it is meant as additional central assistance for states.  
• Delay in release of funds from state treasury has also been highlighted as one of  
the reasons for delay observed in execution of projects.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the key recommendations for the scheme:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  Consistent follow up with the states needs to be taken up to ensure no delay in observed in  
    routing of funds from state exchequer to the implementation agencies/department. A  
    project management system can be developed for the same, wherein approval of project  
    proposals, dates of funds disbursal from center to states and state exchequer to  
    departments should be maintained. Timelines for the same can be decided after  
    consultation with the states, as soon as the timelines are exceeded the central team will be  
    notified by the system who can follow up with the states for the same.
2.  The Scheme has decentralized and bottom-up approach in planning and implementation to  
    ensure that relevant and required projects taking into account the ground requirements are  
    prepared and approved. However, a well-defined exit strategy should also be incorporated  
    with a complementing budget. For example, development of direct marketing linkages  
    between farmers/ farmer groups and the private sector (processing player/ organized  
    retail/ e-commerce etc) is critical and must be emphasised upon. Further, convergences  
    with other central/ state schemes should also be considered for better implementation and  
    cost-effectiveness. For example, the strengthening of production clusters under the RKVY  
    scheme may be linked with forward infrastructure support facilitated under the PPPIAD or  
    other schemes such as the scheme for creation of backward and forward linkage/ Cold  
    Chain/ Agro-Clusters/ Mega Food Park etc.
3.  No social audit has been conducted till date. Given the nature of the scheme, at least two  
    concurrent independent social cost-benefit analysis (mid-term, end-term) needs to be  
    mandated. This apart from quantifying the impact at the grass-root level would also be  
    input provider for future policies
4.  Geo-tagging of infrastructure projects is yet to be undertaken in many states, mainly due to  
    poor internet connectivity, inadequate human resource, lack of funds, and insufficient skills.  
    Geo-tagging should be mandated for interventions, especially for the infrastructure  
    projects.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  In case of Centrally Sponsored Schemes, assistance funds from the Centre are transferred  
    to state treasury and onward to district level agencies. Moreover, since the pattern of  
    funding assistance has been revised to 60:40 contribution ratio between the Centre & State,  
    it has been observed that considerable delays occurs for the state contribution resulting in  
    delays in project implementation and utilization of funds in the financial year. The  
    contribution ratio may be relooked for important infrastructure development projects to  
    avoid delay.
2.  Submission of utilisation certificates by the states also takes considerable time. This creates  
    unnecessary delay in implementation of the scheme. The whole process of approval of  
    proposals, release and subsequent transfer of funds, revision of proposals and utilization  
    reporting, etc. need to be streamlined to reduce delays.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  In almost all the major schemes, there are significant differences among states in terms of  
    scheme progress and utilization. There is a need for more distributed performance across  
    states and accordingly more intense engagement with the lagging states should be taken  
    up. This is a consistent challenge across almost all the schemes.
2.  In many of the schemes, the release of subsidy gets delayed. This delay affects the  
    confidence of the entrepreneurs/ beneficiaries in the scheme and also the funding  
    institutions. Strict adherence to implementation/ approval/ release timelines needs to be  
    ensured, linking it to accountability and performance.

C. Convergence with other schemes

1.  State level consultations can be conducted to identify key focus areas where assistance is to  
    be provided from RKVY, state or regional level teams can be established who can help the  
    laggard states in establishing convergence and developing project proposals. Example of  
    schemes such as NPDD can be followed in planning and implementation, who are utilizing  
    RKVY funds for development of infrastructure which cannot be supported by NPDD  
    schemes due to limitation in cost norms and fund constraints.
2.  The RKVY-RAFTAAR aims at making farming a remunerative economic activity through  
    strengthening the farmer effort, risk mitigation and promoting agri-business  
    entrepreneurship. Thus, it focuses on coverage of diverse range of agri and allied sector  
    activities from production to marketing. Besides, the flexibility and autonomy provided  
    under the scheme to the state and district level agencies in planning, selection, approval and  
    execution of projects/programs is helping in identifying and co-evolving solutions to  
    address the local needs. However, there is significant scope for convergence of the scheme  
    with other central and state level initiatives for better implementation and avoiding  
    duplication. For example, the interventions related to horticulture crop value chain  
    development may be integrated with the MIDH Scheme and Schemes under Pradhan Mantri  
    Kisan SAMPADA Yojana.

While farmers found the scheme to be helpful in employment generation, production,

financial assistance, and marketing facilities, it was found lacking in addressing issues

related to procurement, post-harvest management, capacity building and creation of rural

infrastructure. Increased emphasis should be laid on encouraging participation of farmer

groups to facilitate cost-effective and greater extension coverage of intervention. In this

context, there is a potential of convergence with other large national level programmes such

as SFAC, NABARD and National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) to leverage their existing

database at the field level. These databases can be leveraged for identification of potential

beneficiaries and planning the outreach mechanisms.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  While the Scheme consists of several important components, the output / outcome  
    framework measures limited number of indicators. The output / outcome framework of the  
    Scheme should be revisited to include indicators to reflect the intended objectives in  
    entirety and tracking the progress of projects implemented under the Scheme, such as:

o No. of beneficiaries impacted (category-wise)

o Increase in area/ production/ productivity of focus commodity

o Average increase in beneficiary income

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

o Number/capacity of infrastructure created

o Entrepreneurs supported

o Increase in private sector investment, etc.

1.  Data on Outcomes indicator targets is not available for the scheme. Therefore, it is  
    suggested that the output and outcome indicators aligned with the overall components and  
    objectives of the scheme may be prepared and updated accordingly to standardize the  
    scheme performance tracking and monitoring.
2.  Periodic evaluations need to be in-built in the implementation strategy of the schemes  
    including flexibility for mid-course corrections, if any
3.  Periodic reporting on progress of scheme implementation and tracking of fund utilization  
    should be maintained so that timely appropriate actions may be taken. Measures should be  
    taken to ensure timely contribution of state’s share of fund, to avoid delays in expending  
    funds. It will be even of effective if real-time progress tracking and data monitoring  
    mechanisms are established at state and district level for better implementation and  
    scheme monitoring.

E. Capacity building

1.  Regular awareness generation campaigns should be undertaken to increase awareness  
    about the scheme at the grass-root level to sensitize and encourage participation of farmer  
    groups and private sector players.
2.  Development of marketing infrastructure needs to be supplemented with strengthening of  
    price discovery mechanisms, improved access to market information, linkages with e-  
    trading platforms, capacity building of the beneficiaries including farmers’ collectives and  
    other value chain actors on the aspects of quality standards and certifications, innovative  
    packaging & labelling techniques, branding support etc. particularly for organic labelling  
    and product exports
3.  Strengthening of farmer groups, SHG federations, FPO/ FPC with support under the scheme  
    through capacity building on business aspects and infrastructure assistance should be  
    prioritized
4.  The state budgeting should also incorporate an aspect for skill development and capacity  
    building of project management staff. Focus should be given on appointment/ recruitment  
    of adequate resources at the ground level along with required training of such resources.  
    Periodical refresher training courses should be organized for improvement of the  
    knowledge of the field staff. Project management unit comprising subject matter expert/  
    technical resource at the state and district level may also be considered.
5.  In addition, in all training and capacity building programs for the beneficiaries, certain  
    percentage of women participation may be mandated to promote gender mainstreaming.
6.  Provisioning for climate-resilient practices through the scheme may be beneficial. While the  
    scheme promotes certain climate resilient activities such as adoption of green practices, use  
    of solar energy, green house infrastructure etc., however, these are not mandatory. It is  
    recommended that states may be emphasized upon to include such interventions as part of  
    risk mitigation strategies for potential adverse environmental impact. Moreover, there can

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

be training programmes on climate awareness/ mitigation/ adaptation measures for the

farmers or producers across the schemes

1.  Whereas the scheme promotes R&D through collaboration with ICAR and technology  
    financing, commercialization of R&D results should also be supported. The Scheme sub-  
    component of agri- entrepreneurship promotion may be leveraged for this purpose.

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

The scheme aims at making farming a remunerative economic activity through

strengthening the farmer’s effort, risk mitigation and promoting agri-business

entrepreneurship.

The scheme incentivizes States to increase public investment in Agriculture & allied

sectors. RKVY provides flexibility and autonomy for selection, planning approval and

execution of projects/programs under the scheme as per their need, priorities and

agro-climate requirements.

Therefore, it is recommended to continue the scheme as it aims to ensure holistic

development of agriculture.

Key Inputs from Previous Evaluation of the Scheme:

• Multiple reports have highlighted the need for convergence between schemes,

while RKVY tries to complement the existing schemes and provide additional

support the performance, the status of convergence varies across states and

even sector. Project management and technical experts can be recruited at

either state or central level who can handhold states in establishing convergence

across schemes.

• The reports have also recommended a series of interventions that can be taken

up through RKVY including the promotion of dairy infrastructure development,

crop diversification, use of balanced fertiliser approach, waste land development,

millet seed production, in-situ water conservation methods, better awareness

and outreach, fisheries development etc. The scheme has therefore shifted its

focus on infrastructure development activities, it has successfully converged with

Animal Husbandry department in promotion of dairy infrastructure and Animal

Husbandry activities across many states. But it has to spur its efforts for

promoting other interventions such as waste land development, seed

production, crop diversification and in-situ water conservation activities across

states.

• Need for awareness generation and extension has been highlighted as the key

constraint. A monitoring study conducted in Tamil Nadu highlighted that hardly

20% of the household beneficiary knew about the scheme even when they have

taken benefit under it. In addition, need for frequent training/ capacity building

on package of practices and entrepreneurship has been highlighted under the

study. In this regard RKVY has established convergence with other schemes like

SMAE in states like HP but the level of convergence varies across states.

2.2.3 Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture

Background of the Scheme

In 2014-15, the government launched Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture

(MIDH) to replace the National Horticulture Mission (NHM) launched in 2005-06. MIDH

subsumed the earlier missions like National Horticulture Mission (NHM), Horticulture Mission for

North East & Himalayan States (HMNEH), National Horticulture Board (NHB), Coconut

Development Board (CDB) and Central Institute for Horticulture (CIH), Nagaland. All States and

UTs are covered under MIDH.

MIDH covers horticulture items such as, fruits, vegetables, root & tuber crops, mushrooms, spices,

flowers, aromatic plants, coconut, cashew, cocoa and bamboo. Under the scheme, Government of

India (GOI) contributes 60%, of total outlay for developmental programmes in all the states except

states in North East and Himalayas, 40% share is contributed by State Governments. In the case

of North Eastern States and Himalayan States, GOI contributes 90%. In case of National

Horticulture Board (NHB), Coconut Development Board (CDB), Central Institute for Horticulture

(CIH), Nagaland, GOI contributes 100%. MIDH also provides technical advice and administrative

support to State Governments/ State Horticulture Missions (SHMs) for the Saffron Mission and

other horticulture related activities Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY)/NMSA. Capacity

building of farmers and technicians are also provided for adopting improved technologies. The

scheme also envisages creation of infrastructure for Post-Harvest Management (PHM), Good

Agricultural Prices (GAP), and Centre for excellence for horticulture and marketing for holistic

growth of horticulture sector.

**Objectives of the Mission**^170

• Promote holistic growth of horticulture sector, including bamboo and coconut through

area based regionally differentiated strategies, which includes research, technology

promotion, extension, post-harvest management, processing and marketing, in

consonance with comparative advantage of each state/region and its diverse agro-

climatic features;

• Encourage aggregation of farmers into farmer groups like FIGs/FPOs and FPCs to bring

economy of scale and scope.

• Enhance horticulture production, augment farmers, income and strengthen nutritional

security;

• Improve productivity by way of quality germplasm, planting material and water use

efficiency through Micro Irrigation.

• Support skill development and create employment generation opportunities for rural

youth in horticulture and post-harvest management, especially in the cold chain sector.

Environment & Forests, (in the absence of APC) having representatives from other concerned

Departments of State Government including Forests, the State Agricultural Universities (SAU),

Institutes under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Growers’ Associations/FPOs, etc

oversee the implementation of programmes of the respective States. Central Government

nominates its representative to the SLEC. State Mission Director NHM and HMNEH is the Member

Secretary of the concerned SLEC. At operational level, State Governments have freedom to

establish State Horticulture Mission (SHM) and/ or SBDA as a suitable autonomous agency, to be

registered under Societies Registration Act for implementing Mission programmes at State and

District levels. Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) existing in the State are actively involved in the

implementation of the programme. The SLEC is responsible for vetting annual plans and

implementation of mission activities in the state.

At District level, District Mission Committee (DMC) is responsible for project formulation,

implementation and monitoring. The DMC may be headed by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of

Zila Parishad/ CEO of District Rural Development Agency (DRDA)/ CEO of Forest Development

Agencies (FDA)/ District Development Officer. It has members from concerned line Departments,

growers’ associations, Marketing Boards, local banks, Self Help Groups and other Non-

Governmental organizations. In the case of HMNEH States, Deputy Commissioner/ District

Collector could function as Chairman of DMC. District Horticulture Officer/District Agriculture

Officer are Member Secretary of DMC. For close coordination DMC needs to work closely with

PRIs for monitoring and implementation of mission activities.

The implementation at state level is the responsibility of state level executive committee chaired

by Agricultural production commissioner/Principal Secretary. The SLEC is responsible for vetting

annual plans and implementation of mission activities in the state. The Director

agriculture/Agriculture engineering is the member secretary of SLEC and Director Horticulture

is the Co-member secretary. Representatives of State agricultural university, line departments

and ICAR forms other members of the committee. The department of agriculture engineering or

agriculture at state level are the nodal department at state level for implementation of mission

activities. The nodal department is responsible for overall planning, coordination and

implementation of mission activities.

**Intended contribution to sectoral challenges**

Horticulture contribute nearly 30% to Agriculture and allied GDP with only 12% share in GCA. It

has potential to increase the farmers income, horticulture crops have high productivity and can

be grown through the years. Fruits and vegetable have perennial demand and have substantial

processing potential. Horticulture sector has been instrumental driver of growth since 2004-05.

Consistent interventions since 2004-05 have strengthened India position in fruit and vegetable

production as India has emerged as the 2nd largest producer of horticulture crops. While the

production has increased the sector faces many challenges i.e disease incidences, increasing cost

of production, losses in harvesting transport and storage, price fluctuations. The infrastructure

for segregation, processing, storage for fruits and vegetables is also limited which needs to be

strengthened. In addition usually small and marginal farmers are not able to actively engage in

cultivation of horticulture crops due to high input costs and relatively high initial investment.

While horticulture crops have higher productivity they also need more water and nutrients. MIDH

has been developed by converging multiple schemes and initiating innovative components to

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

strengthen the horticulture activities in India. MIDH in its design covers range of activities under

the value chain of horticulture crops from nursery raising, planting material, mechanisation,

irrigation, integrated pest management and integrated nutrient management, good agriculture

activities, post-harvest infrastructure development, formation of farmers collectives and

marketing.

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

The scheme through its components contributes directly towards national development

objectives of doubling farmer’s income, employment generation and entrepreneurship

development. NITI Aayog’s ‘Strategy for New India @ 75’ has outlined doubling farmers’ income

as priority area for national development.

In addition the scheme also contribute towards attaining targets under following SDGs:

Goal 1: No poverty- the scheme supports promotion of horticulture activities and strengthening

of horticulture value chain, the priority beneficiaries of the scheme are small and marginal

farmers. Horticulture activities helps in increasing diversification and better income generation

opportunity.

Goal 2: Zero Hunger- By promoting good farming practices to improve productivity, fruits and

vegetables are important source of essential vitamins and mineral and increased production

enable better access

Goal 9: Promoting Industry innovation and infrastructure for post-harvest management, storage

**_Achievements_**

• Significant progress has been made in area expansion under horticulture crops, resulting in

higher production.

— Since 2004-05, the area under horticulture grew at an average rate of 2.2% per annum

and annual production increase at an average rate of 5.4% per annum.

— During 2010-11 to 2017-18, the increase in area under production and annual

production has been 3.3% and 1.9%, respectively. This implies that the rate of increase

in production is higher than the rate of increase in area, implying rise in productivity per

hectare of area.

**Achievements**

• Direct benefit transfer to more than 6.6 beneficiaries under the scheme^172

• 1657 nurseries have been accredited^173

• Central sector components National horticulture board and coconut development board

has performed well as a result their allocation has been increasing since 2014-15. The

allocation for NHB tripled from 2014-15 to 2018-19.

• Area coverage, rejuvenation, protected cultivation, mechanisation and post-harvest

management have been major activities under NMH/HMNEH.

• 4.74 lakh of area covered under MIDH since 2015-16. Every year more than 80% of the

targets have been achieved under area coverage however the progress in terms of %

achievement declined consistently across the years. Among the states Chhattisgarh has

brought highest area under horticulture, except for 2018-19 it has achieved 100% of its

physical target every year. The performance of NHM and HMNEH has been satisfactory

(^172) https://hortnet.gov.in/DBT\_BeneficiarySearch\_npb\_all.aspx  
(^173) MIDH presentation

across the year as it has achieved 70-85% of its envisaged targets every year, however

non-reporting of the achievement by states and delay in submission of utilisation

certificates is a major constraint which affect mission activities.

• Haryana, Karnataka, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have been better performing

states, while Jammu Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, and Tripura needs improvement.

• Among the states Jammu and Kashmir has highest unspent funds

• 6874 projects have been supported under NHB, highest number of projects have been

supported under Maharashtra

• The performance variation among states also impact the scheme, laggard states are

pulling overall achievements of scheme down

• Centre of excellence have been formed with Israel, Netherlands and Germany, Indo-Israel

interventions have been successfully implemented in Maharashtra and Haryana in first

phase. The second and third phase is being implemented in other states

• 86% of the total beneficiaries supported under MIDH are small or marginal farmers^174

• The Mission has led to an increase in productivity and increase in farmers’ incomes, along

with increase in horticulture gross cropped area.

• The Mission has also been successful in imparting training to farmer cooperatives, farmer

producer organisations, farmer producer cooperatives, and Self-Help Groups.

• The achievement in terms of expenditure to target achieved ratio stands at 0.89%, which is

significant. Some states like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Himachal

Pradesh, Tripura, Manipur and Mizoram achieved an expenditure to target ratio of more

than 1. However, the performance of UTs has not been impressive. This needs to be looked

at while rationalizing the scheme.

• There is also a need to focus on methods of overcoming droughts, floods, and price

fluctuations in the sector.

(^174) https://hortnet.gov.in/DBT\_BeneficiarySearch\_npb\_all.aspx

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Provision to add newer technologies in the sector with the help of research organizations

and start-ups can bring value to the sector.

Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and Equity

Framework

**Relevance**

• MIDH promotes holistic growth of horticulture sector and encourage aggregation of

farmers into farmer groups like FIGs/FPOs and FPCs to bring economy of scale and scope.

The scheme also aims to enhance horticulture production, augment farmers’ income and

strengthen nutritional security and support skill development and create employment

generation opportunities for rural youth in horticulture and post-harvest management.

Therefore, the scheme is highly relevant considering the increasing importance of

horticulture in the country.

• Promotion of FPOs and their tie up with Market Aggregators (MAs) and Financial

Institutions (FIs) is part of the scheme’s strategy. The scheme guidelines also stress on

creation of post-harvest infrastructure, processing, value addition and marketing with

involvement of private sector which is important for promotion of investment in the

sector.

• The majority of the intended beneficiaries of the scheme are small and marginal farmers

(86% of the total beneficiaries supported under MIDH are small or marginal farmers),

therefore, the scheme needs to place higher focus on promoting FPOs/ FIGs to leverage

the benefits of collectivisation and scale.

• MIDH may include indicators such as additional income generated for the farmers,

reduction in diseases and pest attack and average increase in age of orchards for

assessment of increasing relevance of the scheme to sector needs.

**Effectiveness**

• In terms of physical performance, MIDH has made satisfactory progress as, in many cases,

it has achieved 70-85% of its envisaged targets every year. However, there is wide

variation in the progress between different states. The performance variation among

states impacts the scheme progress as the states with lower performance pull overall

achievements of scheme down.

• Moreover, non-reporting of the achievement by states and delay in submission of

utilisation certificates is a major constraint which affect mission activities. Many states

also delays the state’s contribution which further delays the implementation.

• There are variations in progress in different activities covered under the scheme. Majority

of the states have focused on few components such as increase in area and rejuvenation.

There is much scope of improvement of other interventions related to integrated pest

management, integrated nutrient management, Post-harvest management, etc.

• The progress on outcome indicators highlight the achievement of key outcomes in terms

of increased acreage and higher production.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Lack of good quality planting material has been seen as a major constraint in effective

implementation of mission activities. Focus should be given on development of a network

of certified nurseries which would be able to supply good quality planting materials.

• The scheme has not performed well in terms of area brought under GAP compliant

agricultural practises. The scheme should put more focus on these interventions.

• Some of the outcome indictor wise targets and achievements are not being reported which

is required to assess the effectiveness of the scheme.

• Isolated interventions and fragmented and unorganised infrastructure for pre cooling,

pack-houses, mobile-pre cooling, and cold storage do not have the desired impacts.

Integrated post-harvest management right from aggregation of produce at farm level,

pack houses, cold storage to refrigerated transportation facilities is required in major

production clusters.

**Efficiency**

• As mentioned, the financial progress till 2018-19 indicates financial achievement of

85.4% and 94.4% against BE and RE respectively till 2018-19. MIDH has not been able to

release 100% funds in any of the years.

• Some of the costs norms under scheme needs to be revised in line with the cost escalation

for various components with time. As the cost of different components varies between

states/ regions, variations in cost norms based on states/ regions may be adopted.

• The subsidy percentage is on a lower side for some of the components, especially for

capital intensive facilities such as hydroponics, hi-tech nurseries, tissue culture, etc. as it

may increase the adoption of such interventions.

• Farmers needs to be encouraged and trained in use of machinery and equipment that

reduce drudgery and costs. For small and marginal farmers, custom hiring centres or

equipment banks may be a cost effective option.

• Components that have received 100% funding from centre have shown better financial

utilisation than other important activities such as nursery development and production

of quality planting material where state’s contribution is included.

**Sustainability**

• There is a lack of awareness about the micronutrient deficiency and its impact on

production and soil health.

• Increasing cost of inputs and lack of market intelligence among producers affect

profitability. Most of the interventions are focused on diversification, productivity and

primary processing. These activities are not currently supported through marketing

interventions.

• State departments may be encouraged to recruit qualified technical human resources for

improved implementation.

• Surplus production in certain areas impact the price realisation of farmers and impact

overall profit, especially when the major income of farmers are dependent on a single

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

crop. Diversification with intercropping along with crop rotation should be promoted as

risk mitigation strategy.

• The mission does not create incubation centres for providing hands-on-training and

commercial models for scheme related products and services. The incubation centres will

assist in achieving sustainability of interventions.

**Impact**

• The scheme has made a positive impact through implementation of various interventions.

The evaluation report by Institute for Social and Economic Change highlights that the

Mission has led to an increase in productivity and increase in farmers’ incomes, along with

increase in horticulture gross cropped area.

• The mission has also been successful in imparting training to farmer cooperatives, farmer

producer organisations, farmer producer cooperatives, and Self-Help Groups.

• Achievement in terms of expenditure to target achieved ratio stands at 0.89%, which is

significant. Some states like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Himachal

Pradesh, Tripura, Manipur and Mizoram achieved an expenditure to target ratio of more

than 1.

• Provision to add newer technologies in the sector with the help of research organizations

and start-ups can bring value to the sector. The mission may actively promote such

interventions. This will assist in achieving higher impact through scheme’s interventions.

• As mentioned, some of the outcome indictor wise targets and achievements are not being

reported. It is recommended to measure the outcome indicator wise achievements yearly

which would assist in assessment of the impacts of the scheme.

• The data on direct and indirect employment generated by the scheme is not captured and

maintained by the Department. The employment generation data (including employment

generated for SC/ ST and Women separately) may be captured to assess the overall impact

of the scheme in this regard.

**Equity**

• While the State Horticulture Missions have been directed to ensure that at least 30% of

annual budget allocation is earmarked for women beneficiaries/ farmers, gender wise and

beneficiary wise information is not being maintained as the scheme is mainly area

oriented for development of horticulture.

• As per the information available on DBT portal there are 5346 women farmers (<1%) who

have been benefitted under the scheme, of these 59.4% women beneficiaries are from

Kerala and Karnataka, number of women farmers benefited under the scheme is very low

in many states.

• It is suggested to impart specific trainings on gender awareness under the scheme for

encouraging involvement of women beneficiaries.

• Few states despite having large SC/ST population base have performed poorly for

instance in case of Madhya Pradesh less than 2% of the total beneficiaries are SC/ST. More

field demonstrations should be conducted, especially in the tribal/ aspirational districts

to increase tribal participation.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas

i. Accountability and transparency

MIDH envisages a central management information system for monitoring and progress of

mission activities. NMH/HMNEH, NHB sub-schemes have separate MIS. Information about the

MIDH can be accessed from https://midh.gov.in/. The scheme guidelines contains detailed

information on cost norms and its various component. Aadhar linked direct benefit information

is also being implemented under the scheme. Relevant scheme specific information and progress

related information is also available on the website. State wise action plan, JIT reports,

presentations, meetings, release, value chain studies are also available on MIDH. The website of

NHB contains information on beneficiaries supported under the project. In addition grievance and

problems can also be submitted online. Information on fund transfer mechanisms is detailed in

previous sections.

Robust monitoring mechanism is followed to assess mission progress. The progress is closely

monitored by Executive Committee headed by Secretary (DAC&FW). The Empowered Committee

under the Chairmanship of Additional Secretary (DAC& FW) also monitors the progress while

approving project based proposals of State Governments on a quarterly basis. The Joint Inspection

Teams (JITs), comprising officers from DAC & FW, State Agricultural Universities and Precision

Farming Development Centers undertake regular visits to States for monitoring of the Mission.

The reports of JITs are also available on public domain.

Independent evaluation studies of NHM, NHB and HMENH are also available on public domain.

To prevent leakages a robust monitoring mechanism has been adopted as mentioned earlier. In

addition, teams constituted by ministry and state nodal agencies consistently visit states and

project sites to track project progress. Aadhar linked beneficiary transfer and continuous social

audits through PRI institutions also help in building transparency. States are also being

encouraged to update progress on Public Financial Management System, states like Haryana are

doing well in updating information on timely basis.

The income increase among scheme beneficiaries has been analysed in the HH Survey.

Figure 141 : MIDH - Income Increase between 2015-16 and 2018- 19

There has been around 59% income increase among scheme beneficiaries.

ii. Gender mainstreaming

As an inbuilt provision under MIDH scheme, higher rates of subsidy have been envisaged for

women beneficiaries for taking up activities. Focus has been given in imparting trainings to

women beneficiaries.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

State Horticulture Missions have been directed to ensure that at least 30% of annual budget

allocation is earmarked for women beneficiaries/ farmers. However, since the scheme is mainly

area oriented for development of horticulture, gender wise and beneficiary wise information is

not being maintained in the horticulture division.

As per available data coverage of scheme for women beneficiaries who have been benefitted

directly through subsidy has been low. The information available on DBT portal shows that 5346

women farmers (<1%) have been benefitted under the scheme of these 59.4% women

beneficiaries are from Kerala and Karnataka, and no. of women farmers benefited under the

scheme is very low in many states. The major constraint highlighted by the stakeholders in low

coverage of women is scarce ownership of land in rural areas. Specific trainings on gender

awareness are also not being conducted under the scheme.

As observed in the HH Survey the share of male and female workers in scheme beneficiary

households has been analysed. The graph below depicts the same.

Figure 142 : MIDH - Share of male and female workers

iii. Direct/Indirect employment

MIDH is focused on increasing diversity through increase in area under horticulture crops and

increase in post-harvest processing level. Direct benefit transfer is being ensured through the

scheme. The state-wise information on the number of beneficiaries benefited under the scheme

is under

Highest beneficiaries under the scheme are from Andhra Pradesh (15.9%). 44.40% of total  
beneficiaries are from South Indian states of AP, Kerala and Karnataka. Among eastern states  
Chhattisgarh accounts for 13.6% of total beneficiaries. However the records are not being  
maintained on direct employment generation under the scheme.  
**_iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient  
practices & diversifications_**  
Horticulture helps to mitigate the climate change effects through microclimate moderation,  
conservation of natural resources carbon sequestration and creation of additional source of  
livelihood and income opportunities. The interventions are targeted to increase area under  
horticulture crops, the orchards helps in carbon sequestration and mitigation. Horticulture crops  
also diversify the source of income for farmers and help in reducing risks. More than 4 lakh  
hectares of area has been bought under horticulture. Focus is there on rejuvenation of old  
orchards, increasing input use efficiency through mechanisation and drip irrigation^175 , protective  
cultivation, organic farming and integrated pest management and nutrient management. Good

agriculture practices and package of practices is also being encouraged. These activities help in

building climate resilience and better input use efficiency.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the scheme

in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

Nearly 25% funds are allocated exclusively for SC/ST population. About 23% of the total subsidy

being provided under the scheme is for SC/ST beneficiaries. SC/ST beneficiaries are also eligible

for higher subsidy than general counter parts.

vi. Use of IT/Technology in driving efficiency

The scheme has been integrated with direct benefit transfer. Its progress and achievements are

regularly updated on MIS. Data on DBT transfers and state-wise subsidy released is regularly

updated on the website. Its sub-schemes also have separate MIS and reports are generated

regularly. The updated progress data that has been shared by the department is also taken from

MIS. The beneficiary level data and SC/ST related information has been taken from state MIS. The

annual plans and release for each state can be accessed, NHB is also displaying beneficiary level

data. However the states are not regularly updating information which impact the progress of the

scheme. The states are encouraged to update financial progress on PFMS system. To accomplish

e-Governance in NHM for ensuring transparency in online application filing, authentication,

processing and online payment to the beneficiary’s bank account through DBT, HORTNET has

been developed. In addition applicants can also apply for different components under MIDH

through https://hortnet.gov.in/. Geo tagging of the assets can be encouraged as it is not being

practiced regularly by all states. In addition to hornet portal, the Horticulture Statistics Division

of Department of Agriculture and Cooperation has introduced Horticulture Area Production

Information System (HAPIS) for ensuring the timely availability of relevant and latest data on

horticulture crops at sub-national level. The system provides online interface enabling data flow

from Districts. It is accessible within the NIC network.

Coordinated programme on Horticulture assessment and management using geo-informatics

(CHAMAN) has also been initiated with Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centres (MNCFC).

vii. Development, dissemination & adoption of innovative practices, technology & know-

how

MIDH focuses on dissemination of information by encouraging trainings on post-harvest method,

Good agriculture practice. Multiple value chain studies have been conducted across states on

different horticulture crops which are available on MIDH website.

**Some important studies are highlighted under**

• Value chain studies on Mango in Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Gujarat

• Value chain study on Onion in Karnataka

• Value chain study on Moringa in Tamil Nadu

• Value chain study on Peach in Uttrakhand

• Value chain studies on Tomato in Jharkhand, Chattisgarh and Haryana

• Value chain studies on Pineapple in Manipur and Tripura

• Value chain studies on Apple in Himanchal Pradesh and Uttrakhand etc

The studies are taken up to understand the challenges and opportunities of taking up cultivation

of particular crop and its value chain. In addition Centre of Excellence (CoE) for Horticulture have

been established in collaboration with Israel, Netherlands and Germany. The CoE serves as

demonstration and training centre for latest technologies in horticulture development. It also

serves as source of planting material for fruits and vegetable seedlings for protected cultivation.

The first phase of Indo Israel partnership has been successfully implemented in Haryana and

Maharashtra and has resulted in better productivity and higher production of vegetable and

horticulture crops in state. Second phase has been implemented in Haryana, Gujarat,

Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Karnatka, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh. The

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

phase three has been implemented in Mizoram, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana. Indo-Netherlands

collaboration is being implemented in Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka and Jammu and

Kashmir.

**_viii. Unlocking Synergies with other Government Programmes_**

The scheme in its design focuses on convergence of multiple schemes, there is focus on creation

of water sources with convergence with MGNREGS. Convergence is also being established for

promotion of organic farming with PKVY/MOVCDNER. Various groups, state level SHGs and FPOs

formed under other scheme can also apply for activities. Tie up with SFAC is initiated for

promoting FPOs. Panchayati Raj institutions are also being engaged in district level planning and

convergence for activities under MGNREGS. National centre for cold chain development is also

being involved for technical support and guidance. There are National Level Agencies (NLAs) like

NCCD, DCCD, DASD, NHRDF, NBB, Spices Board etc. for which 100% grant is provided under MIDH

for carrying out various interventions like Research & Development, capacity building, skill

development leading to overall development of horticulture in the country. Convergence is being

established with PMKSY, RKVY and NMMI for implementation of other components.

ix. Research and development

National Level Agencies (NLAs) like NCCD, DCCD, DASD, NHRDF, NBB, Spices Board etc. for which

100% grant is provided under MIDH for carrying out various interventions like Research &

Development, capacity building, skill development leading to overall development of horticulture

in the country. Convergence is being established with PMKSY, RKVY and NMMI for

implementation of other components. Centre excellence have been established with Israel,

Holland and Germany. The areas of collaboration under COE are primarily related to Post harvest

management, water management technologies, pollination technologies, plant protection and

disease control, irrigation-fertigation, development of new varieties, Farmer organisation and

training and demonstration

x. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives (e.g.

Farmer cooperatives, FPOs, Water User Associations, etc.) and civil society in the

scheme

Promotion and strengthening of Farmer Interest Groups (FIG), Farmer Producer Organizations

(FPO) and Growers Associations have been included as a component under MIDH. Assistance is

provided to such groups, as per the norms specified by SFAC, for taking up of innovative projects

in the area of horticulture development, post-harvest management, processing and marketing.

Within the scheme FPOs/FIG have been formed in only few states like Chhattisgarh, Haryana,

Karnataka and Odisha. Few states such as Gujarat, West Bengal, Telangana and Kerala have been

allocated fund but have not formed any groups. Promotion of FPOs and their tie up with Market

Aggregators (MAs) and Financial Institutions (FIs) is part of the strategy. The scheme guidelines

also stresses a lot on creation of post-harvest infrastructure, processing, value addition and

marketing with involvement of private sector. However, formation of FPOs and FIGs needs to be

strengthened, mechanisms needs to be developed for encouraging private players in the market.

Issues and Challenges

Below are the major issues and challenges of MIDH _:_

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The mission is doing well and has achieved desired progress in most of the cases, however  
    the activities should be spread across all states.

o The costs norms under scheme needs to be revised with the cost escalation for

various components with time

o Majority of states have focused on few components such as increase in area and

Rejuvenation. There is much scope of improvement of other interventions related

to integrated pest management, integrated nutrient management, Post-harvest

management, etc.

1.  As horticulture is a seasonal activity, delay in release of funds also affect scheme progress
2.  Limited staff strength at state level is a major challenge in scheme implementation and  
    awareness generation.
3.  Lack of good quality planting material has been seen as a major constraint in effective  
    implementation of mission activities. Development of nurseries is an important  
    component which has not seen the potential progress. The cost norms for hi-tech  
    nurseries are not in line with the market rates. Establishment and maintenance of  
    nurseries is a time bound activity and delay in funding and lack of staff affect its progress.
4.  Due to limited funding and staff strength in some states, the scheme has not able to reach  
    many aspirational districts where horticulture can be promoted as supplementary  
    activity to agriculture
5.  Sometimes it is difficult to encourage small and marginal farmers in diversifying to  
    horticulture due to high initial costs and relatively low returns in initial years.
6.  Most of the interventions are focused on diversification, productivity and primary  
    processing. These activities needs to be supported through marketing interventions.
7.  The scheme guidelines stress on aggregation of produce through FPOs/FIG and  
    involvement of private sector, however these areas have not adequately progressed in  
    scheme implementation.
8.  Following issues identified in the value chain needs to be considered in planning and  
    implementation of the scheme^176

o Lack of quality inputs i.e. seeds, planting material, pesticides, fertilisers is a major

constraint which affect the quality of crops

o Horticulture crops are highly perishable. Lack of cold storage and logistics have

been observed as a major bottleneck because of which at times farmers are forced

to sell produce at throwaway prices

(^176) Value chain studies conducted under MIDH and Impact Evaluation of National Horticulture Mission (NHM )  
and Horticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States (HMNEH ), Institute for Social and Economic  
Change, 2017, Field survey and KII

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

o Farmers in many areas either do not have access to soil health card or are not

following the recommended doses which affect quality of produce and impact soil

health.

o Isolated interventions and fragmented and unorganised infrastructure for pre

cooling, pack-houses, mobile-pre cooling, cold storage do not have the desired

impacts.

o There is a general lack of awareness among farmers regarding the micronutrient

deficiency and its impact on production and soil health.

o Persistent spread of rootstock diseases, wilt and nematode has been a major

problem observed in key production clusters. These diseases impact overall

health and age of the orchards. Pests such as root borer, aphid, etc. also affects the

production.

o Lack of awareness about good farming practices has been observed as the major

challenge. Increased use of fertilisers and pesticides, untimely sowing, irrigation

and input use are some of the areas that have been seen as major constraints that

affect production.

o Surplus production in certain areas impact the price realisation of farmers and

impact overall profit. It is observed in key horticulture clusters of many states that

farmers are usually dependent on one or two crops e.g potato in UP, Tomato in

Andhra Pradesh, etc. At times when production is good the price of the crops fall

and the farmers are forced to sell or dump their produce in mandis or to agents.

o Lack of segregation, cleaning, packing and unsustainable harvesting practices by

farmers/ orchard lease holders also affect the quality of produce which impact

their marketability. This has been observed in case of important fruit crops such

as Mango and Guava.

o Increasing cost of inputs and lack of market intelligence among producers also

affect profitability

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  Delay in progress of activities and processing of funds is observed for components where  
    funds are transferred to state treasury and state’s contribution is required. Some states  
    do not contribute the required 40%; this is observed even in case of hill states and NE  
    states which are required to contribute 10%. In such cases the funds are reallocated to  
    better performing states which leads to skewed progress. Some states such as Jammu and  
    Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar are not updating progress regularly.
2.  Components that have received 100% funding from centre have shown better financial  
    utilisation than other important activities such as nursery development and production  
    of quality planting material where state’s contribution is included.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

C. Capacity building

1.  Dependence on hired labour increases costs and affects profitability.
2.  Need for more field demonstration activities has been highlighted to encourage  
    adoption among farmers^177

D. Convergence with other schemes and programs

1.  For mechanisation, efforts for convergence with SMAM need to be pushed. The cost norms  
    of SMAM are currently not being followed. In order to ensure that the beneficiaries get  
    high quality farm machinery and post harvesting equipment, equipment that have been  
    tested and approved under SMAM may be promoted under this scheme.

E. Others

1.  Progress on interventions such as beekeeping has been limited.
2.  Availability of water is critical for horticulture crops. Water resources created under the  
    scheme suffer from lack of maintenance.
3.  Many farmers reported that they have opted for crop insurance scheme but are not getting  
    compensation for their losses despite filing claims. This increases their risks and  
    discourage farmers from going to relatively expensive interventions such as horticulture  
    crop production.

(^177) Value chain studies conducted under MIDH and Impact Evaluation of National Horticulture Mission (NHM )  
and Horticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States (HMNEH), Institute for Social and Economic  
Change, 2017, Field survey and KII  
**Key Reasons for Low Fund Utilization for Certain Components and Among  
States:**  
• It has been highlighted that the components which received 100% central  
assistance under the scheme have shown better performance as opposed to  
those which require state’s share.  
• It has been observed that some states do not contribute the required 40%  
and this is observed even in case of hill states and NE states which are  
required to contribute 10%, in such cases the funds are reallocated to better  
performing states. Some states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya  
Pradesh and Bihar are not updating progress regularly, which affect scheme  
performance, overall utilisation of funds and allocation is skewed towards  
better performing states.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

On the basis of the discussion above, the presence of scheme’s issues and challenges have been

presented below:

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are some of the recommendations for the scheme:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The cost norms and assistance that is being provided needs to be updated every year.  
    Moreover, there is need to diversify activities under the scheme as majority of the states  
    have focused on few components such as increase in area and rejuvenation. There is much  
    scope of improvement of other interventions related to integrated pest management,  
    integrated nutrient management, Post-harvest management, etc. Considering this,  
    concerted effort should be made to increase improve the performance of such activities  
    through awareness generation.

o Some of the costs norms under scheme needs to be revised in line with the cost

escalation for various components with time. As the cost of different components

varies between states/ regions, variations in cost norms based on states/ regions

may be adopted.

o The subsidy percentage may be increased for some of the components, especially

for capital intensive facilities such as hydroponics, hi-tech nurseries, tissue

culture, etc. as it may increase the adoption of such interventions.

1.  The delay in fund flow affect the scheme performance as horticulture is a seasonal activity,  
    a separate mechanism may be adopted for funding activities that are seasonal in nature,  
    such funds may be disbursed at priority at the start of the financial year to prevent delay.
2.  Horticulture requires technical expertise, fruits and vegetable require more inputs and are  
    susceptible to diseases. Harvesting of the produce and post-harvest handling also impact  
    the product quality and price. Presence of technical staff at district/block level helps in  
    better awareness generation among farmers and improve these practices, therefore staff  
    strength at state and district level can be assessed, districts with lower vacancies can be  
    prioritized for selection and states should be directed to fill in the vacant positions
3.  Lack of good quality planting material has been seen as a major constraint in effective  
    implementation of mission activities. Focus should be given on development of a network  
    of certified nurseries which would be able to supply good quality planting materials. The  
    plants/ planting materials should be bar coded to ensure traceability.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  More field demonstrations should be conducted, especially in the tribal/ aspirational  
    districts to increase farmers’ participation.
2.  Successful small and marginal farmers engaged in horticulture activities can be identified  
    at district and block level, these farmers can be used as resource persons to encourage and  
    motivate others to take up horticulture
3.  The scheme has done well in promoting production practices, however better market  
    linkages are necessary for reducing gap between farm gate and consumer prices, therefore  
    the scheme should focus on creating effective forward linkages for farmers. The scheme  
    envisages promotion of FPOs and their tie up with Market Aggregators (MAs) and Financial  
    Institutions (FIs). Formation of FPOs and FIGs needs to be strengthened and mechanisms  
    need to be developed for engaging private players especially for forward linkages.
4.  As mentioned, the scheme guidelines stress on aggregation of produce through FPOs/FIG  
    and involvement of private sector. The scheme should focus on promoting FPOs/ FIGs to  
    leverage the benefits of collectivisations and scale. This is very important as majority of the  
    beneficiaries of the scheme are small and marginal farmers.
5.  The gaps identified are critical and need to be assessed for ensuring the envisaged outcome  
    of the schemes. An independent assessment of the scheme to assess these areas needs to be  
    carried out and value chain studies of commodities needs to be conducted to identify critical  
    interventions for each commodity. Critical areas of interventions such lack of planting  
    material, disease control, unavailability of inputs, inadequate integrated post-harvest  
    infrastructure for storage, processing, grading and logistics of perishable commodities,  
    needs to be addressed through reviewing scheme and establishing convergence with other  
    schemes.

o Integrated post-harvest management right from aggregation of produce at farm

level, pack houses, cold storage to refrigerated transportation facilities should be

encouraged in major production clusters.

o Surplus production in certain areas impact the price realisation of farmers and

impact overall profit, especially when the major income of farmers are dependent

on a single crop. Diversification with intercropping along with crop rotation

should be promoted as risk mitigation strategy

o In addition micro-irrigation can be promoted in horticulture clusters and soil

health card testing facilities can be established through other schemes (SHM).

o In case of post-harvest management, the KIIs suggested that the smaller scale

projects can be taken up by state governments whereas the larger projects can be

directly implemented by the department at the ministry. This is primarily due to

limited capacity at the state government level.

o Schemes like SMAE and ISAM can focus on extension, awareness and development

of marketing infrastructure in horticulture clusters.

o Within the scheme FPOs/FIGs have been formed in only few states such as

Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka and Odisha. Few states such as Gujarat, West

Bengal, Telangana and Kerala have been allocated fund but have not formed any

groups. Formation of FPOs and FIGs needs to be strengthened.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

o Promotion of FPOs and their tie up with Market Aggregators (MAs) and Financial

Institutions (FIs) is part of the scheme’s strategy. The scheme guidelines also

stresses a lot on creation of post-harvest infrastructure, processing, value addition

and marketing with involvement of private sector, which may be focused on

bringing in investment in the sector.

1.  As per the information available on DBT portal there are 5346 women farmers (<1%) who  
    have been benefitted under the scheme, of these 59.4% women beneficiaries are from  
    Kerala and Karnataka, number of women farmers benefited under the scheme is very low  
    in many states. There is need for engaging with lagging states for inclusive development.
2.  Few states despite having large SC/ST population base have performed poorly for instance  
    in case of Madhya Pradesh less than 2% of the total beneficiaries are SC/ST. More field  
    demonstrations should be conducted, especially in the tribal/ aspirational districts to  
    increase tribal participation.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  There is a need for more distributed performance across states and accordingly more  
    intense engagement with the lagging states should be taken up.

o As mentioned, delay in progress of activities and processing of funds is observed

for components where state’s contribution is required. More intensive

engagement with the lagging states may be taken up for expediting the

implementation of the scheme across all states.

1.  Certain important components which are important for development of the sector may be  
    funded 100% by centre for better overall development and addressing of sectoral needs.

C. Capacity building

1.  Farmers needs to be encouraged and trained in use of machinery and equipment that  
    reduce drudgery and costs. For small and marginal farmers, custom hiring centres or  
    equipment banks may be a cost effective option.
2.  Low awareness about the training programmes and other benefits of the scheme is an issue.  
    There is a need for awareness generation about the scheme through state governments and  
    at the central level. On field demonstration can be conducted as part of training activities to  
    build awareness
3.  The mission may also create incubation centres for providing hands-on-training and  
    commercial models for scheme related products and services. The incubation centres  
    would assist entrepreneurs in terms of both technical and business skills.
4.  There is a general lack of awareness about good farming practices. The scheme has not  
    performed well in terms of area brought under GAP compliant agricultural practises. The  
    scheme should put more focus on these interventions.
5.  Limited staff strength at state level is a major challenge in scheme implementation and  
    awareness generation. Therefore, the state departments may be encouraged to recruit  
    qualified technical human resources for improved implementation.
6.  Increasing cost of inputs and lack of market intelligence among producers affect  
    profitability. Most of the interventions are focused on diversification, productivity and

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

primary processing. These activities needs to be supported through marketing

interventions. Hence, convergence with agri-marketing schemes is critical for success of the

scheme interventions.

1.  There is a lack of awareness about the micronutrient deficiency and its impact on  
    production and soil health. Training programs for farmers covering these aspects should be  
    promoted actively.
2.  It is suggested to impart specific trainings on gender awareness under the scheme for  
    encouraging involvement of women beneficiaries.

D. Convergence with other schemes and programs

1.  Farmers needs to be encouraged and trained in use of machinery and equipment that  
    reduce drudgery and costs. For small and marginal farmers, custom hiring centres or  
    equipment banks may be a cost effective option. Convergences with SMAM may be  
    promoted on a cluster approach in this regard.

E. Others

1.  Progress on interventions such as beekeeping has been limited. Awareness needs to be  
    created on importance of bees in pollination, rejuvenation and protective cultivation.  
    Supporting interventions for sale of the honey produced from rearing of bee can also be  
    encouraged.
2.  Conservation and maintenance of water resources in key horticulture clusters can be  
    promoted through scheme and convergence with other schemes
3.  The issues may be addressed through PMFBY and problems faced by farmers in claim  
    settlement can be assessed after an independent evaluation in key production clusters.
4.  As mentioned, some of the outcome indictor wise targets and achievements are not being  
    reported. It is recommended to measure the outcome indicator wise achievements yearly  
    which would assist in assessment of the impacts of the scheme.
5.  While the State Horticulture Missions have been directed to ensure that at least 30% of  
    annual budget allocation is earmarked for women beneficiaries/ farmers, gender wise and  
    beneficiary wise information is not being maintained as the scheme is mainly area oriented  
    for development of horticulture. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain database for  
    effective monitoring of scheme and its impact.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Key Inputs from Previous Evaluation of the Scheme:

MIDH has been constantly updated, there are evaluation reports and value chain

studies provided in the MIDH website that have identified need for intervention in

following areas for improvement of horticultural value chain.

• Availability of quality inputs including seeds, planting material, pesticides,

fertilisers

• Development of cold chain infrastructure for storage and transport of

perishables

• Input use efficiency and need for application of inputs as per soil health

and crop type

• Isolated interventions, fragmented and unorganised infrastructure for pre

cooling, pack-houses, mobile-pre cooling, cold storage

• Persistent spread of pests and diseases

• Need for awareness on good farming and harvesting practices

• Low price realisation for farmers

• Increasing cost of inputs and lack of market intelligence among producers

also affect profitability

The current form of the scheme focusses on these aspects in its design, however,

these are not adequately addressed in implementation. As can be seen from the

progress reports, the major interventions under the scheme focus on area coverage,

rejuvenation, protected cultivation, mechanization and post-harvest management.

Therefore, it is important to align the scheme interventions with the gaps identified

in the value chain studies. The interventions should also be diversified and provide

adequate focus on production of quality disease free planting material, good

agricultural and harvesting practices and encouraging input use efficiency in

production of horticultural crops. This will help in cost optimization and help in better

price realization for farmers and contribute towards higher achievement of scheme

outcomes.

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

This has now re-structured as the Mission on Integrated Development of Horticulture

(MIDH). This is to be continued given the increasing importance of horticultural

produce in term of production, contribution to farm based livelihoods, dietary habits,

nutritional security, processing and export potential. The Scheme performance is

also satisfactory on both financial and physical progress having a large budget of

more than Rs. 2000 crores.

The component of farm mechanization of MIDH may be merged with Sub-Mission on

Agriculture Mechanisation as these are similar components. Otherwise, farm

machineries included under MIDH can be as per SMAM norms of assistance to ensure

standardization. Any revision in the norms of assistance under SMAM may also be

applicable under MIDH.

2.2.4 National Food Security Mission

Background of the Scheme

National Food Security Mission was launched in 2007-08 to increase the production of rice, wheat

and pulses by 10, 8 and 2 million tonnes respectively by the end of 11th Plan. After the success of

the Mission, it was decided to continue the plan beyond the 11th Plan. The Mission continued

during 12th Five Year Plan with new targets of additional production of food grains of 25 million

tonnes of food grains comprising of 10 million tonnes rice, 8 million tonnes of wheat, 4 million

tonnes of pulses and 3 million tonnes of coarse cereals by the end of 12th Five Year Plan.^178

Beyond the 12th Plan, the Mission is being continued for 2019-20, with targets of additional

production of 5 million tonnes of rice, 3 million tonnes of wheat, 3 million tonnes pulses, and 3

million tonnes coarse cereals. The core objective of the Mission is to bridge the yield gap in respect

of these crops through dissemination of improved technologies and farm management practices.

Under the programme, various incentives like production and distribution of seeds, supply of seed

mini kits, Front Line/Cluster Demonstrations, improved farm implements, bio-pesticides,

micronutrients, bio-fertilizers etc. are provided to the farmers. Modern technologies like

improved varieties, ridge-furrow methods of planting, effective water management, application

of bio-fertilizers, inter cropping with cereals/pulses, eco-friendly plant protection measures etc.

are promoted through cluster demonstrations.

**Objectives of the Mission**

• Increasing production of rice, wheat, pulses, coarse cereals and nutri cereals through area

expansion and productivity enhancement in a sustainable manner in the identified

districts of the country

• Restoring soil fertility and productivity at the individual farm level; and

• Enhancing farm level economy (i.e. farm profits) to restore confidence amongst the

farmers.

**Major components of NFSM**

• National Food Security Mission – Rice (NFSM-Rice)

• National Food Security Mission – Wheat (NFSM-Wheat)

• National Food Security Mission – Pulses (NFSM-Pulses)

• National Food Security Mission - Coarse cereals (NFSM-Coarse cereals)

• National Food Security Mission – Nutri cereals (NFSM- Nutri cereals)

• National Food Security Mission – Commercial crops (NFSM-Commercial crops)

• National Food Security Mission – Oilseeds and Oilpalm (NFSM-Oilseeds)

**Implementation structure and stakeholders**

**National level**

The General Council (GC) constituted under the Chairmanship of the Union Minister of

Agriculture and Farmers Welfare acts as the policy making body providing suitable directives and

guidance to the Mission and reviewing the overall progress and development of the scheme. The

GC is empowered to lay down and amend the operational guidelines, change of the

components/interventions as per the requirement and decide need based re-allocation of

resources across States and districts and also approve projects as per the requirements. The

National Food Security Mission - Executive Committee (NFSM-EC) oversee the activities of the

Mission and approve the annual State Action Plans for foodgrain crops

(rice/wheat/pulses/coarse-cum-nutri cereals), commercial crops, oilseeds/oil palm/tree borne

oilseeds. The NFSM-EC is led by Secretary (AC&FW).

**State level**

The State Food Security Mission -Executive Committee (SFSM-EC) is constituted by the State

Government under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary to oversee the activities of the Mission in

the State. Some states manage the implementation at the state level through the State Agricultural

Management & Extension Training Institute (SAMETI) and the Agricultural Technology

Management Agency (ATMA) at the district level, while some states directly transfer the funds

through treasury to district level (Joint Director/Deputy Director, Agriculture or equivalent).

**District level**

At the district level, a committee is established under the Chairmanship of District Collector/ CEO

of Zila Parishad. The scheme is implemented through Project Management Team (PMT) or district

Agriculture/Department Horticulture Officers /ATMA for the NFSM-crops. District Food Security

Mission -Executive Committee (DFSM-EC) will also be involved in project formulation,

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

implementation and monitoring of the scheme components through the Agriculture Department

involving concerned stakeholders.

**Intended contribution to sectoral performance**

With nearly 195 million undernourished people, India shares a quarter of the global hunger

burden^179. Nearly 47 million or 4 out of 10 children in India are not meeting their full human

potential because of chronic undernutrition or stunting^180. Hunger or undernutrition has

consequences such as diminished bodily capacity, reduced earnings, and increased risk of

poverty. The government has thus designed multiple food security measures. However, the

country still has many challenges such as slowing agriculture growth, climate change, land

degradation and shrinking bio-diversity. Large tracts of farmlands in India have become barren

due to imbalanced fertiliser use and excessive use of a single fertiliser, urea.

Acknowledging this, the National Food Security Missions seeks to bolster food security in the

country through increase in production and productivity of rice, wheat, pulses, coarse cereals

(maize and barley) and nutri-cereals in a sustainable manner. The scheme also intends to restore

soil fertility and productivity at the individual farm level, and enhance farm profits. In order to

achieve these objectives, the scheme will focus on low productivity and high potential states,

implement cropping system-centric interventions in Mission mode, increasing pulses production

through utilization of rice fallow, rice bunds and intercropping of pulses with coarse cereals,

oilseeds and commercial crops (sugarcane, cotton, jute), promotion of improved technologies,

including integrated nutrient management, monitoring of mission progress, and periodic

evaluation of interventions.

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

India’s national development agenda calls for doubling farmers’ income by 2022. There are

multiple strategies adopted for achieving this goal, for instance, improvement in crop

productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost

of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops;

improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations.

Various aspects of the national development agenda are part of Centrally Sponsored Schemes,

including NFSM. The Mission contributes to all these aspects through use of technology, crop

diversification, focus on food security while maximising value addition, and restoring soil fertility.

Similarly, NFSM aligns with the UN SDGs as well. The scheme focusses on multiple SDGs including,

Zero Hunger, Gender Equality, No Poverty, Climate Action, Responsible consumption and

production, and Reduced Inequalities.

The mission also focusses on gender equality by making special provisions for women

beneficiaries. It also promotes responsible consumption and production and taking proactive

action on climate change through reclamation of fallow lands, inter-cropping, crop rotation, micro

irrigation, integrated nutrient management, and use of environment-friendly fertilisers and

pesticides. It even seeks to reduce inequalities by extending special provisions to marginalised

groups, as also small and marginal farmers. In a nutshell, the following SDGS are catered through

this scheme:

**Observations**

• The funds allocated by the Department of Agriculture to NFSM have been rising over the

years.

• The funds allocated by the state to NFSM has also been rising except for 2018-19 where it

saw a slight dip.

• The utilization of NFSM funds has been noteworthy, with utilization consistently being

over 98%. However, utilization by states in significantly less. This is because some states

are slow in bringing their matching share of funds, thus delaying expenditure of funds.

• KIIs revealed that some states like Punjab, Telangana, Kerala, and Goa have slow

utilization of funds. Punjab and Telangana have been slow in submitting UCs as well.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• One of the objectives of the mission includes increasing production of rice, wheat, pulses

and coarse cereals through area expansion and productivity enhancement. While the

scheme is fairly relevant for ensuring food security, some of the components of the

mission such as NFSM- Nutri cereals, NFSM-Commercial crops, NFSM-Oilseeds and Seed

village programme are not in direct correlation with objectives of the mission. Therefore,

the objectives may be expanded to cover all of the components under the mission.

• One of the intended outcome of NFSM is - Surplus food grain production of around 10

million tonnes for export purpose. The intended outcome of extra tonnage for exports may

not be in line with the objectives of National Food Security Mission.

• The key objectives of the scheme includes increase in production & productivity and

enhanced farm level economy. It is recommended to incorporate market development and

linkage components for improving farm level profits.

**Effectiveness**

• The yield for rice has risen from 2,391 kg/ha in 2014-15 to 2,539 kg/ha (6.2%) in 2017-

1.  The yield for wheat has increased from 2,750 to 3,318 kg/ha (20.5%) in this period,  
    while that for cereals has risen from 1,703kg/ha to 1,871kg/ha (9.9%). However, the yield  
    for pulses during this period has declined from 725 kg/ha to 635 kg/ha (12.8%).

• The total release under NFSM amounts to Rs. 136,796 lakh, the number of beneficiaries

covered were 412,932 in 2018-19, while number of registered farmers were 446,465.

• As a result of NFSM, the incomes of beneficiaries have increased in the range of Rs.3,764

to Rs. 66,763 depending on the crop.

• Therefore, the scheme has been effective, however, performance is not measured for

output and outcome indicators on a yearly basis. It is recommended that the output and

outcome indicators are revised and performance is monitored on a periodic basis.

**Efficiency**

• The funds allocated by the Department of Agriculture to NFSM have been rising over the

years. Also, the funds allocated by the state to NFSM has also been rising except for 2018-

19 where it saw a slight dip.

• The utilization of funds under NFSM have been consistently over 98%. However,

utilization by states in significantly less. It was highlighted that this is because some states

are slow in bringing their matching share of funds, thus delaying expenditure of funds.

**Sustainability**

• Many sustainable practices have been promoted under NFSM, including micro irrigation,

bio-fertilizers, bio-pesticides, integrated nutrient management, soil reclamation, etc.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

However, there is need for specific training/ awareness campaigns to sensitize

beneficiaries about climate change and its impact.

• As a result of demonstrations and training and capacity building, the farmers have

implemented new technologies on their farms, including high-yielding variety

seeds/hybrid seeds, drip irrigation, inter-cropping, and used bio-pesticides and bio-

fertilizers on their farms under mission's interventions. These activities need to be

expanded for sustainability.

• The activities under the scheme such as one-time marketing support to un-registered

farmer groups, SHGs, SHG federation etc. for local marketing of pulses and millets;

mobilization of farmers into registered producer organizations with inputs on training

and capacity building; support for branding and marketing of milled pulses or millets;

allowing FPOs to enter into partnership for seed production and seed procurement, access

to credit and improved technologies, reduce transaction costs, facilitate value addition,

tap high value markets; encouragement of Public Private Community Partnerships (PPPC)

for millets promotion, etc. need to be focussed upon for ensuring sustainability.

**Impact**

• While the mission has certain activities related to marketing support, it majorly focusses

on increasing production and productivity and there is a gap when it comes to market

intervention tools. Agricultural marketing plays an important role not only in stimulating

production and consumption but in accelerating the pace of economic development.

• A unique feature of the NFSM is its capability to develop bio-fortified seeds/crops to meet

future nutrition requirement, which is essential in a country like India, where 15.2% of

the population suffers from undernutrition. Bio-fortification helps in increasing

nutritional value of crops. Currently the Mission does not have much focus on this aspect.

• It is suggested that initiatives such as projects with focus on high productivity areas may

be rolled out, provide support to institutes/ organizations including NGOs in remote

areas, integration of value chain for small producers, assistance to custom hiring centres

may be promoted.

**Equity**

• A component of gender-budgeting exists in the scheme. However, there are no specific

trainings offered to women to enhance their roles as decision makers.

• The scheme allocates funds to SC/STs to ensure participation of these marginalized

groups in the sector. However, specific measures and awareness campaigns need to be

undertaken to encourage these groups to enter this sector.

• There is no data available for the number or proportion of informal jobs converted into

formal as a result of NFSM and their distribution across various social groups.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas

i. Accountability and transparency

NFSM’s structure is intended to have high level of accountability to ensure there are no leakages

and the funds reach the intended beneficiaries. This is enabled through setting up of monitoring

committees at national, state and district levels, ensuring multiple check-points to minimise

leakages. The scheme is implemented by a Project Management Team (PMT) at National, State,

and District levels. The PMT at the National level is led by the Mission Director, and consists of

advisors/consultants, program manager, senior programmers, technical assistants, and other

support staff. With regard to Oilseeds/Oil Palm/TBOs, it is managed by the existing Technical

Support Group (TSG) at national level through outsourcing agencies. Similarly, PMTs are

constituted at the state and district levels. The monitoring of the Mission is also done at the

National, State, and District levels individually, with responsibility for monitoring accorded to the

NFSMEC, SFSMEC, and DFSMEC, respectively. KIIs revealed that regular on-site verifications are

carried out by the department to check for project progress, fund utilization, and beneficiary

identification, etc. Additionally, a central portal is maintained which gives the department

complete visibility of monitoring project progress, fund utilization, beneficiary details, etc. Some

states maintain state portals as well. The Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and state departments

also monitor projects to ensure minimal leakages.

The data has been captured well in NFSM website as well.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The scheme has multiple check points to ensure minimal leakages.

• The Mission has a strong mechanism of monitoring and evaluation with the involvement

of all the implementing agencies and the line departments^181.

− At the National level, the activities of the Mission are monitored by a Committee to

under the Chairmanship of the Mission Director with members from DAC&FW, ICAR,

SAUs, CDDs, Research Institutions and officials of State Departments

− At the state level, the activities are monitored by a Committee constituted under the

Chairmanship of the State Mission Director with members from the line departments,

SAUs, Lead Bank, NABARD, KVKs/ICAR institutes and Crop Development Directorates

of DAC&FW

− At the district level, monitoring is undertaken by DFSM-EC supported by the Project

• Most of the information, including scheme guidelines, action plans, status papers, DBT

reports, MIS reports, etc. are available on public domain

• KIIs indicated that the department as well as states and district officials conduct regular

on-site visits. However, no social audit has been conducted till date.

• The scheme implements DBT, which further helps in plugging leakages.

• The department has also conducted impact evaluation studies for assessment of the

scheme during 11th Five Year Plan (200 7 - 12) and 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17).

• A grievance mechanism exists from the scheme wherein officials have been allocated the

responsibility of preparation of replies to RTIs and public grievances.

ii. Direct/Indirect employment generation

While the share of agriculture in employment has been declining over the years, it still plays a

pivotal role in the Indian economy. Such a structural shift though expected in a developing

economy, has been slower in the Indian economy^182. The ‘Strategy for New India@75’ report^183 ,

indicated the need to create 80-90 lakh jobs annually to deploy the country’s youth coming into

the workforce every year, besides absorbing those moving from the farming to non-farming

sectors.

The NFSM promotes employment generation through unique interventions such as:

• Provision of millet kitchen carts to unemployed youth

• Encouraging unemployed youth / entrepreneurs to work at/open millet kitchens

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The NFSM database does not maintain any records of employment generated through the

scheme as the core objective of the scheme is to increase production and productivity

— However, an impact evaluation study conducted for 12th plan period (2012-17)

concluded that there has been either a decrease in number of man-days (rice, jute), or

no change (wheat, pulses, cotton, sugarcane). Only in case of coarse cereals, an

increases of 17.7 man-days was observed^184.

• There are no special programmes for generating employment for women farmers. The

scheme only allocates 30% of funds to women farmers (its impact on employment

generation is not quantified).

• Similarly, no special programmes are run to include SC/ST farmers. The scheme allocates

16% funds to SCs and 8% to STs. The impact of such an allocation on employment

generation in these groups is not quantified.

• There is no data available for the number or proportion of informal jobs converted into

formal as a result of NFSM

The income increase of around 41.6% among scheme beneficiary households has been observed

in the HH Survey. The findings has been depicted in the graph below.

iii. Gender mainstreaming

As per Census 2011, out of total female main workers, 55% were agricultural labourers and 24%

were cultivators. However, only 12.8 per cent of the operational holdings were owned by women,

which reflect the gender disparity in ownership of landholdings in agriculture. Moreover, there is

concentration of operational holdings (25.7%) by women in the marginal and small holdings

categories. Women are involved in labour intensive jobs such as weeding, hoeing, grass cutting,

picking, cotton stick collection, separation of seeds from fibre, etc.

To encourage women in the sector, the scheme mandates allocation of 30% funds to women

beneficiaries. However, no data was available on number of women beneficiaries in the scheme.

• In addition, the NFSM GC is mandated to have Secretary, Ministry of Women & Child

Development. This is to ensure that adequate attention is accorded to gender issues in

policy formulation.

• Similarly, NFSM EC is mandated to have Secretary, Ministry of Women & Child

Development. This is to ensure that sufficient attention is given to women in state annual

action plans.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The scheme incorporates women-centric policies to ensure their participation in the

sector.

• A component of gender-budgeting also exists in the scheme.

• The Millet Entrepreneurship component of the scheme puts special focus on women

entrepreneurship activities associating with women federations, associations.

• The scheme looks at women participation only in terms of allocation. It fails to create any

safeguards for women in terms of ensuring their safety at workplace, or provision of

policies like crèches, flexible working hours, inclusion in decision-making etc.

• The evaluation studies so far conducted do not lay any focus on gender wage gap

• Moreover, there are no specific training offered to women to enhance their roles as

decision makers.

• Currently, no provisions are in place for sensitization of workforce on gender equality.

The share of male and female workers in the scheme beneficiary households has been analysed

in the HH survey.

iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient

practices & diversifications

Indian agriculture remains vulnerable to weather, and the threat of climate change is likely to

expose this vulnerability further. Agriculture accounts for 14% of greenhouse gas emissions^185.

Acknowledging this, initiatives are being undertaken to make agriculture more adaptive and

resilient to climate variability and in the process to reduce carbon emission. Such initiatives under

NFSM include crop diversification programme, crop rotation programme, inter-cropping

programme, etc. Additionally, for sustainability of the high productivity areas, special projects

such as reclamation of problematic soils, development of water-logged areas and mitigation of

adverse effect of climate change are funded under the Mission.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The Ministry has collaborated with ICRISAT, ICAR, and IIMR for developing stress-

tolerant/ climate-resilient varieties of crops.

• Many sustainable practices have been promoted under NFSM, including micro irrigation,

bio-fertilizers, bio-pesticides, integrated nutrient management, soil reclamation, etc.

• Inter-cropping of pulses with sugarcane in autumn and spring in 12 states, along with

trainings and demonstrations have been undertaken.

• However, there are no special training/awareness campaigns to sensitize beneficiaries

about climate change and its impact.

• There is no risk reduction plan in place, or any waste management/end-of-life system in

place for resources.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the

scheme in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

In accordance with the decision of the Government of India regarding implementation of Special

Component Plan (SCP) for Scheduled Castes and Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) for Scheduled Tribes, 16%

of the total allocation for SCP and 8% for TSP will be earmarked. However, states are allowed to

make allocation to SC/ST farmers proportionate to their population in the States/districts.

Note: \*Data for 2019-20 pertains to funds released until 30 October 2019 (not final grant)

Source: Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare for NFSM

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The scheme allocates fund to SC/STs to ensure participation of these marginalised groups

in the sector.

• However, no other measures are included in the scheme to encourage these groups to

enter this sector.

• A total of Rs.1,53,427 lakh have been spent for SC/ST beneficiaries during 2015-16 to

2019 - 20 (as of 30 October 2019) (refer Figure 152 ), amounting to an average utilization of

24.75% of funds during this period.

• Data regarding components towards which these funds have been utilised was not

available.

• There is no data on how the fund allocation has changed the employment pattern in the

sector as a result of this scheme.

• The scheme does not have any special capacity building initiatives for these groups.

vi. Use of IT/technology in driving efficiency

While agriculture is the main source of livelihood for majority of the country’s population, it still

stands as a technologically backward sector. Inadequate farm mechanization, lack of access to

modern tools & technologies, limited internet connectivity in rural areas, and lack of effective

marketing support are some of the challenges that plague the sector. To tackle this, the Mission

promotes adoption of improved technologies like seed, integrated nutrient management (INM)

including micronutrients, soil amendments, integrated pest management (IPM), input use

efficiency and resource conservation technologies. In addition, ICT is used for reporting,

monitoring and evaluation of the Mission. Specialized software for the reporting, monitoring and

evaluation of the Mission's activities also exists reflecting the details of benefit extended to

individual beneficiaries through DBT. Under the Accelerated Crop Production Programme

(ACCP), large blocks of crop area are taken up for demonstration of production and protection

technologies. Further, to support important location specific interventions which are not covered

under normal activities in the Mission but can help in production and productivity (including

adoption of new technologies like drones) can be financed in NFSM.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• Many IT and technology tools are in place under NFSM. These include: portal, app,

demonstrations, geo-tagging, DBT, etc.

• A unique feature in this scheme is the inclusion of technology adoption under local

initiatives.

• The NITI Aayog report^186 , however, raises concerns over the newer technologies in

NFSM because packaged demonstrations of only established technologies and known

practices have been funded under NFSM. There is little scope for experimenting with

new technologies.

• Geo-tagging is also being undertaken as part of the scheme.

• An online MIS also exists to ensure regular update of progress and effective supervision.

• The scheme promotes technology adoption through demonstrations, use of IT-based tools

in trainings, adoption of technologies in nutrient management and resource conservation.

• The scheme, however, lacks any concrete measures for marketing of produce to ensure

decent price realization by farmers.

vii. Development, dissemination & adoption of innovative practices, technology & know-

how

The scheme includes multiple components for innovative practices. For instance, it provides

research and development support for development of innovative supply chain models, online

marketing platforms, among others. The scheme also encourages Public Private Community

Partnerships (PPPC) to speed up process of millets promotion. Centres of Excellence are also

created under the scheme, which look at commercializing innovative technologies developed at

CoEs. The CoEs are also responsible for sensitization and awareness of beneficiaries for enhancing

production and consumption, through media and capacity building initiatives.

Additionally, the NFSM-Oilseeds & Oil Palm allows states to utilize 10% of the plan budget as flexi

fund to pilot innovations and improved efficiency within the overall objective of the Scheme and

its expected outcomes.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• Attention has been paid to encourage innovative practices under this scheme

• Special awareness programmes are undertaken to popularize millet products among the

consumers and generate demand

• Awareness building is also done through formation and development of Farmer/Kisan

Producer Company and other institutional forms.

• KIIs indicated that in order to create awareness among the beneficiaries, campaigns are

undertaken through televisions, radio, newspapers, etc.

• Regular awareness and publicity campaigns are undertaken by organizing fairs,

exhibitions, and fests about the importance of Millets and the improved technologies

including high yielding varieties and better cultivation practices.

• However, specific data regarding budget spent on awareness campaigns was not

available.

• The acceptance has been good among beneficiaries. KIIs highlighted that private

companies have also come forward for producing of value-added millet items. Millets also

now form a key component of government’s Mid-Day Meal scheme. Hence, farmers have

been receiving good prices for their millets produce.

**_viii. Stakeholder and Beneficiary behavioural change_**

Behavioural change seeks to study change in behaviour of beneficiaries in terms of decision-

making post implementation of scheme. The scheme promotes adoption of technology, micro

irrigation, diversification of crops, inter-cropping, crop rotation, integrated nutrient

management, as well as local initiatives. Since implementation of the scheme, production increase

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

by 35 million tons was observed during 2007- 2012187. An increase in income of farmers was also

observed during this period^188. KIIs indicated that the beneficiaries have been positively impacted

as a result of the scheme and a majority of them have seen tangible benefits from it. As a result of

demonstrations and training and capacity building, the farmers have implemented new

technologies on their farms, including high-yielding variety seeds/hybrid seeds, drip irrigation,

inter-cropping, and used bio-pesticides and bio-fertilizers on their farms.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The scheme has positively impacted yield and incomes of farmers.

— The yield for Rice has risen from 2,391kg/ha in 2014-15 to 2,539kg/ha (6.2%) in

2017 - 18189. The yield for wheat has increased from 2,750 to 3,318 kg/ha (20.5%) in

this period, while that for cereals has risen from 1,703kg/ha to 1,871kg/ha (9.9%).

However, yield for pulses during this period has declined from 725 kg/ha to 635 kg/ha

(12.8%).

— The incomes of beneficiaries have risen in the range of Rs.3,764 to Rs. 66,763

depending on the crop as a result of the scheme^190.

• Regular awareness and publicity campaigns are undertaken by organizing fairs,

exhibitions, and fests about the importance of Millets and the improved technologies

including high yielding varieties and better cultivation practices.

• However, specific data regarding budget spent on awareness campaigns was not

available.

• Discussions also revealed that though micro irrigation has been adopted in some states,

most states have not adopted it as a common practice. This is because paddy is

traditionally seen as a water-intensive crop.

ix. Research & Development

R&D activities in the NFSM aim to facilitate strategic research, address specific issues, and

minimize gap between actual yield and potential yield. The NFSM allows engaging with State

Agriculture Universities (SAUs), and National and International research organizations for

research themes, including but not limited to, conservation of natural resources (land, water) and

their efficient use, Integrated Nutrient Management, Integrated disease and pest management,

modification/refinements in farm machines/tools for various soils types/cropping systems,

upscaling of improved crop varieties/hybrids in NFSM adopted states/agro-climatic zones under

water/thermal stress conditions, nutrient management in acidic/alkaline/sodic soils, and any

other approach for enhancement of productivity and production. The scheme also encourages

exposure visits to international organizations.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• In most of the states, farmers realize lesser yield for the Nutri-Cereal crops as compared

to the yield demonstrated by the research institutes. There is, therefore, potential for

increasing the productivity by using/promoting the newly released varieties and

improved package of practices^191.

— Inability of the farmers in ensuring the improved package of practices as

demonstrated by the research stations often lead to yield gap.

• The improved practices for demonstrations in the scheme are also identified in

consultation with SAU through their Regional Research Stations/KVKs located in the area.

• 4 - 5 projects have been sanctioned for research on increasing shelf-life of millets to Indian

Institute of Millets Research (IIMR), Hyderabad.

• There is no fixed percentage of allocation for R&D under the scheme.

x. Unlocking synergies with other government programmes

Being such a large scheme, with so many components, the scheme is bound to have convergence

with other schemes.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• Some of the major schemes, NFSM has convergence with:

— Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana (PMKSY), for micro irrigation

— Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA), for

micro irrigation

— Sub Mission on Agriculture Mechanization

— Integrated Pest Management

xi. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives and civil

society in the scheme

The scheme calls for involvement of community collectives, cooperatives, Self Help Groups (SHGs)

in distribution of certified seeds and minikits, and establishment of seed gardens.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• Marketing support to un-registered farmer groups, SHGs, SHG federation etc. for local

marketing of pulses and millets (@Rs.2.00 lakh per group of 15 farmers, for one time

support only).

• It encourages mobilization of farmers into registered producer organizations of around

1000 members each, with inputs of training and capacity building and training (as per

model FPO Process Guidelines of DAC).

• It provides Support for branding and marketing of milled pulses or millets (available only

to registered FPOs @ Rs.5.00 lakh per FPO, for one time support only).

• The CoEs are to focus on Value chain integration of farmers (FPOs, SHGs) by adopting a

market based approach in production there by creating an efficient supply chain and

market linkages to farmers.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Under NFSM-Oilseeds & Oil Palm, private sectors and NGOs can be involved through the

State Department s of Agriculture and Horticulture only.

• The FPOs are allowed to enter into partnership for seed production and seed

procurement, access to credit and improved technologies, reduce transaction costs,

facilitate value addition, tap high value markets etc.

• The scheme encourages Public Private Community Partnerships (PPPC) for millets

promotion.

• KIIs highlighted that private companies have also come forward for producing of value-

added millet items.

• NFSM has the capability to scale up FPOs by bring together more small and marginal

farmers under its ambit^192.

Discussion on sector specific thematic assessment

At least 30% of the cluster demonstrations under NFSM is being conducted by adopting cropping

system approach to utilize the rice fallow area for pulses cultivation^193. A project to cover 4.5 m

ha Rice fallow area @ 1.5 m ha area every year for 3 years i.e. 2017-18 to 2019- 20 in the states

namely Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal is under implementation.

Demonstration projects are being undertaken to test for improved production technology of

pulses and oilseed^194. In addition, support is to the nodal Central agency i.e State Department of

Agriculture/ Horticulture for undertaking Systematic Plantation of Tree Borne Oilseeds (TBOs)

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

on the newly developed wasteland as well as existing wasteland/ degraded forest land. To

promote the tree borne oilseeds (TBOs), special incentives are given. For instance, farmers who

have undertaken plantation of TBOs are distributed pre-processing equipment and oil extraction

equipment, and given R&D support and special trainings. Additional assistance is provided in

Annual Action Plan for NFSM towards cost of maintenance of TBOs plantation from 2nd year of

plantation until its gestation period. TBO-related activities may also be undertaken as part of the

flexi fund (10% of total allocation).

A unique feature of the NFSM is its capability to develop bio-fortified seeds/crops to meet future

nutrition requirement, which is essential in a country like India, where 15.2% of the population

suffers from undernutrition^195. Bio-fortification helps in increasing nutritional value of crops.

Currently the Mission does not have much focus on this aspect. However, KIIs revealed that

nutrition and bio-fortification will be the new focus areas of the Mission going forward.

Currently, the Mission does not have any special incentives to promote start-ups in the sector.

Collaborating with some tech-savvy start-ups can help the Mission upscale technology adoption

at a faster pace. This would also help accelerate the pace of demonstrations, as the start-up may

be able to take up projects in simulation-mode.

Issues and Challenges

Some of the major issues and challenges in the scheme are as follows:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The NFSM scheme is implemented by a Project Management Team (PMT) at National, State,  
    and District levels. With regard to Oilseeds/Oil Palm/TBOs, it is managed by the existing  
    Technical Support Group (TSG) at national level through outsourcing agencies. The  
    monitoring of the Mission is also done at the National, State, and District levels individually,  
    with responsibility for monitoring accorded to the NFSMEC, SFSMEC, and DFSMEC,  
    respectively. KIIs indicated that regular on-site verifications are carried out by the  
    department to check for project progress, fund utilization, and beneficiary identification,  
    etc. Additionally, a central portal is maintained which gives the department complete  
    visibility of monitoring project progress, fund utilization, beneficiary details, etc. Some  
    states maintain state portals as well. The Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and state  
    departments also monitor projects to ensure minimal leakages. The scheme has a robust  
    and well-rounded governance in place at all levels- National, state, and district, along with  
    presence of Project Management Teams (PMTs) at each of the levels. While this ensures a  
    robust implementation structure, the existence of multiple agencies slows down decision-  
    making and hinders fast-tracking of critical projects. Typically, such a scenario would lead  
    to delay in starting of projects and consequent delay in disbursement of funds. By the time  
    the funds are released, there may also be a rise in raw material and project cost, rendering  
    the whole mechanism less fruitful. This also adds to the administrative work as reporting is  
    to be done at all these levels.
2.  A study undertaken for evaluation of NFSM in Rajasthan highlighted the inadequacy of staff  
    at Department of Agriculture via-a-vis approved positions^196. Even the ones who are  
    working at the department are involved in administrative tasks. The report also highlighted

(^195) National Family Health Survey (2015-16)  
(^196) NABARD Consultancy Services, Concurrent Evaluation Report of NFSM in Rajasthan, 2012

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

that at lower hierarchy viz. Agriculture Supervisors (AS), staffs were not adequately trained

in terms of technical knowledge but some of them were well experienced in terms of

practical field knowledge and well interacted with community. This indicates that AS are

good for organizing activities related to NFSM but may not adequate for providing technical

inputs.

1.  In accordance with the decision of the Government of India regarding implementation of  
    Special Component Plan (SCP) for Scheduled Castes and Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) for  
    Scheduled Tribes, 16.6% of the total allocation for SCP and 8.6% for TSP are earmarked  
    under NFSM. Similarly, at least 33% allocation of the fund is to be made for small and  
    marginal farmers, and at least 30% allocation of the fund is to be made for women farmers.  
    However, a major gap in implementation of scheme is that while the scheme allocates a  
    certain percentage of funds to vulnerable groups like women, SC/STs, and small and  
    marginal farmers, it does not take any other concrete steps to promote their participation  
    in the sector. For instance, there is insufficient attention given to promoting  
    entrepreneurship among these groups. There are no mandates to ensure that these  
    vulnerable groups, especially women are given a safe and healthy working environment.
2.  The scheme majorly focusses on increasing production and productivity but has a large  
    lacuna when it comes to market intervention tools. Agricultural marketing plays  
    an important role not only in stimulating production and consumption but in accelerating  
    the pace of economic development. The traditional market intervention tools like price  
    support, price signalling, etc. may be complemented and strengthened through selective use  
    of innovative market approaches like futures markets^197.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  Funds for implementing the Mission are released to the State government with due  
    approval from NFSM-EC. The state government then releases the funds to the state level  
    implementing agency through PFMS/Treasury. The funds are then released to the district  
    level agency. The release of the funds are made in two instalments- first instalment during  
    April-June, and second instalment during October-December on fulfilment of pre-defined  
    conditions. While the mechanism of funds transfer is transparent, the mandate regarding  
    release of instalments only during certain months may not be the best practice. The  
    mechanism may be made more flexible.
2.  The scheme’s mechanism is such that subsidies and other welfare benefits are transferred  
    through DBT. While this is in line with GoI mandate, there are many rural and tribal areas  
    which don’t have adequate banking facility and proper road connectivity. Micro ATMs  
    which were set up to deliver cash benefits at door step are not present in many areas, hence  
    many beneficiaries have to travel long to withdraw money^198.

C. Capacity building

1.  Institutional strengthening and capacity building of human resource, particularly, in the  
    context of small and marginal farmers, tenant farmers in the remote areas and high risk yet  
    strategic crops like pulses and coarse cereals and nutri-cereals are required to sustain the

new initiatives in long run. Training of trainers/farmers plays crucial role in speedy

dissemination of improved crop production practices. Special trainings are conducted

before kharif and during kharif season, and before rabi and during rabi season. While

regular training sessions are conducted, poor attendance of farmers was an issue in some

of the states^199 , including West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya,

Nagaland, and Madhya Pradesh. In some of the states, reading material were not properly

supplied. However, the overall response from these trainings was satisfactory.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the key recommendations for the scheme:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  A project approval and disbursal flow can be developed and timeline for each activity needs  
    to be fixed. Timelines of project approval and disbursal of funds must then be strictly  
    adhered to. The department may fix accountability of officers at each level to ensure  
    adherence to timelines.
2.  Reassessment of positions and teams available at Central and state level can be done and  
    vacancies needs to be filled in immediately. A training need assessment of staff at various  
    level can be carried for development of training and capacity building plan
3.  Aspirational districts with high population of tribal and vulnerable community can be  
    targeted and prioritized for mission implementation. As the population across aspirational  
    districts is from socially and economically marginalized groups this will ensure better  
    coverage of the scheme among marginal communities. We understand that the land  
    ownership among women is limited, therefore regions where the participation of women is  
    higher in farm workforce can be targeted to benefit more women under the scheme.
4.  The key objectives of the scheme include increase in production & productivity and  
    enhanced farm level economy. It is recommended to also incorporate market development  
    and linkage components for improving farm level profits and overall development of the  
    sector. Agricultural marketing plays an important role not only in stimulating production  
    and consumption but in accelerating the pace of economic development. The traditional

(^199) Spectrum Planning India Limited, Impact Evaluation Study of CSS National Food Security Mission, October  
2017

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

market intervention tools like price support, price signaling, etc. may be complemented and

strengthened through selective use of innovative market approaches like futures markets.

1.  It is suggested that initiatives such as projects with focus on high productivity areas may be  
    rolled out, provide support to institutes/ organizations including NGOs in remote areas,  
    integration of value chain for small producers, assistance to custom hiring centers may be  
    promoted.
2.  Most of the information, including scheme guidelines, action plans, status papers, DBT  
    reports, MIS reports, etc. are available on public domain. Based on KIIs, the department as  
    well as state officials conduct regular on-site visits. However, it is recommended to conduct  
    periodic cost-benefit studies for the mission.

_B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation_

1.  The utilization of funds under NFSM have been consistently over 98%. However, utilization  
    by states in significantly less. It was highlighted that this is because some states are slow in  
    bringing their matching share of funds, thus delaying expenditure of funds.
2.  The decision on flexibility in disbursal of funds and adoption of DBT in rural areas with  
    limited infrastructure activities has to be taken in consultation with finance department.  
    However, some flexibility is recommended in guidelines to ensure efficient implementation
3.  A component of gender-budgeting exists in the scheme. However, there are no specific  
    trainings offered to women to enhance their roles as decision makers which should be  
    included under the mission.

C. Capacity building

1.  All states needs to be instructed to ensure that the extension material is provided to the  
    trainees preferably in local language in easy to read form.
2.  The activities under the scheme such as one-time marketing support to un-registered  
    farmer groups, SHGs, SHG federation etc. for local marketing of pulses and millets;  
    mobilization of farmers into registered producer organizations with inputs on training and  
    capacity building; support for branding and marketing of milled pulses or millets; allowing  
    FPOs to enter into partnership for seed production and seed procurement, access to credit  
    and improved technologies, reduce transaction costs, facilitate value addition, tap high  
    value markets; encouragement of Public Private Community Partnerships (PPPC) for  
    millets promotion, etc. need to be focused upon for ensuring sustainability. It was informed  
    by the department that private companies have also come forward for producing value-  
    added millet items which needs to be further encouraged. As a result of demonstrations and  
    training and capacity building, the farmers have implemented new technologies on their

**Key Reasons for Low Fund Utilization for Certain Components and Among  
States:**

• It has been highlighted that the multiple levels of checks and approvals tend to

delay the project activities and fund disbursal.

• The funds are released from the department from state treasury from thereon it

is released to district level agencies, the mechanism is transparent but practice of

releasing funds in certain months tend to cause inadvertent delay. In addition,

while the utilisation at central level is high it is less so in case of states.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

farms, including high-yielding variety seeds/hybrid seeds, drip irrigation, inter-cropping,

and used bio-pesticides and bio-fertilizers on their farms under mission's interventions.

These activities need to be expanded for sustainability.

1.  For improvement of the knowledge of the field staff, periodical refresher training courses  
    should be organized.
2.  A unique feature of the NFSM is its capability to develop bio-fortified seeds/crops to meet  
    future nutrition requirement, which is essential in a country like India, where 15.2% of the  
    population suffers from undernutrition. Bio-fortification helps in increasing nutritional  
    value of crops. Currently the Mission does not have much focus on this aspect. Therefore,  
    bio-fortification should be one of the focus areas of the Mission.
3.  Many sustainable practices have been promoted under NFSM, including micro irrigation,  
    bio-fertilizers, bio-pesticides, integrated nutrient management, soil reclamation, etc.  
    However, there is need for specific training/ awareness campaigns to sensitize  
    beneficiaries about climate change and its impact. Moreover, the same may include climate  
    change and sustainability related issues for greater awareness concerning use of water  
    saving devices and use of resilient varieties.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  The output and outcome indicators do not cover the scheme objectives in entirety.  
    Therefore, it is suggested that the output and outcome indicators may be aligned with the  
    overall components and objectives of the scheme. The output and outcome indicators under  
    the mission are limited to additional area under cultivation, increased productivity and  
    surplus production for foodgrains only. The progress with respect to other components of  
    the scheme have not been included.
2.  One of the intended outcome of NFSM is - Surplus food grain production of around 10  
    million tonnes for export purpose. The intended outcome of extra tonnage for exports may  
    not be in line with the objectives of National Food Security Mission.
3.  It is recommended that a periodic cost-benefit analysis is undertaken for the Mission.
4.  NFSM does not track and record employment generated through the Mission. The database  
    should also maintain records of employment generated for future policy making.

E. Convergence with other schemes and programs

1.  Tie-ups can be established with international initiatives and NGOs such as world food  
    program, FAO and precision agricultural development, Tata-Cornell, PRADAN, AKRSP for  
    research, collaboration and input delivery for productivity improvement. It has been  
    observed that universities and institutions in India are developing varieties with better  
    productivity and disease resistance but are not able to market them. These collaboration  
    will help in better marketing and achieving higher volume of production.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

The scheme aims to

• Increase production of rice, wheat, pulses, coarse cereals and nutri cereals

through area expansion and productivity enhancement in a sustainable manner

• Restore soil fertility and productivity at the individual farm level; and

• Enhance farm level economy (i.e. farm profits) to restore confidence amongst

the farmers.

The scheme interventions are important for ensuring food and nutritional security in

India. Therefore, the scheme needs to be continued.

The agricultural mechanization component under flexi-funds of NFSM is implemented

as per Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) norms. Any revision in the

norms of assistance under SMAM is also be applicable under NFSM. This component can

be merged with SMAM as the objectives and the components are similar in nature.

2.2.5 National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP)

Background of the Scheme

National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP) was launched in 2014-15 and subsumed with

NFSM from 2018- 19200. NMOOP comprises of three sub-missions which are for Oilseeds, Oil Palm

and Tree Borne Oilseeds.

**Objectives of the Scheme**

The main objectives and targets of NMOOP by 2019-20 are given below.

• Increase in production and productivity of vegetable oils sourced from oilseeds and oil

palm. It aims to augment the availability of vegetable oils and to reduce the import of

edible oils by increasing the production of oilseeds from an average production of 29.79

million tonnes and productivity of oilseeds from 1122 kg/ha during 2016-17 to 36.10

million tonnes and 1290 kg/ha, respectively by end of 2019-20.

• To cover an area of about 4.20 lakh ha under oil palm cultivation by 2020 with an

additional area of 1.05 lakh ha under oil palm.

• An area of 4800 ha will be covered under plantation of 9 TBOs namely olive, mahua,

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Supply of PP chemicals/ bio-pesticides/ weedicides/ micronutrients over an area of 2.45

lakh ha.

• Distribution of 1.08 lakh farm implements/ equipment.

• Distribution of 5774 sprinklers and 85.26 lakh mt water carrying pipes.

• Oilseeds production of 31.31 million tonnes has been achieved during 2017-18 which is

the highest during past four years of implementation of the programme.

• Average yield of 1270 kg/ha of oilseeds has been achieved during 2017-18, which is the

highest ever.

NFSM (Oil Palm)

NFSM (Oil Palm) (NFSM-OP) is dedicated to oil palm area expansion and productivity

enhancement. During 2018-19, NFSM-OP is being implemented in 13 states. But Andhra Pradesh,

Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Mizoram are the major oil palm growing states.

Major interventions of NFSM-Oil palm during 2018-19 are as follow:

• Additional area coverage of oil palm plantation of 27,000 ha.

• About 66,148 ha are under maintenance and intercropping.

• Coverage of 8,555 ha under drip irrigation.

• Distribution of 449 pump sets & 784 bore wells.

All these developmental efforts have resulted in area expansion under oil palm from 8,585 ha in

1991 - 92 to 3.31 lakh ha by the end of 2017-18.

NFSM (TBOs)

Assistance under NFSM-TBOs is provided to promote various TBOs namely Simarouba, Neem,

Jojoba, Karanja, Mahua, Wild apricot, Cheura, Kokum, Tung and Olive having capability to grow

and establish in varied agro-climatic conditions as well in the waste land of the country.

The interventions under NFSM-TBOs are integrated development of nurseries & plantation on the

wasteland, maintenance of TBOs plantation, incentives for undertaking intercropping with TBOs,

Research and Development, distribution of pre-processing, processing and oil extraction

equipment, training of farmers, training of extension workers and local initiatives/contingency.

During 2018-19, NFSM-TBOs programme is being implemented 10 (ten) states i.e Arunachal

Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Mizoram,

Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal with plantation with plantation

of TBOs in 3,800 ha.

The targets and achievements on output and outcome indicators are not available for the scheme

in public domain.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Issues and Challenges^203

NMOOP has been merged into NFSM, therefore, only the challenges related to oilseed, oil palm

and TBO have been highlighted below.

1.  Despite the increase in production in recent years, India remains a net importer of  
    oilseeds. Oilseed crops in India are typically marred by low productivity which results in  
    limited profitability for farmers, the yield data analysis conducted Doubling Farmer  
    Income Report Volume III shows significant yield gap in oilseed production in India. The  
    analysis indicates that yield performance of oilseeds in India is 66% of global average, the  
    yield gaps between FLD and farmer’s yield for major oilseeds such as groundnut, soybean  
    and rapeseed also range from 37 to 71%.
2.  Instances of diseases are also becoming more prevalent in recent years, which is  
    increasing the cost of production and affecting the overall profitability of farmers
3.  The capacity utilization of oil industry remains very low in India it ranges between 20-  
    30% for oil mills to 50% for vegetable oil refineries
4.  Currently, policy regime permits blending of any two oils in the ratio of 80:20. Therefore,  
    low priced edible oil like imported palm oil is blended with high priced quality oils like  
    rapeseed – mustard, groundnut, sunflower, sesamum, thus, discouraging expansion of  
    area and production. The FSSAI data, shows that not more than 2% of blended oil is sold  
    in the market. However, in reality the market share of blended oil is much higher.
5.  The procurement of oilseeds is fairly limited in India and is done for select few  
    commodities in only some states, that is why farmers prefer to sow wheat as it is has  
    better productivity and is easier to sell in market

Recommendations^204

1.  High area - Low productivity districts can be targeted for boosting production and  
    reducing yield gap. It is highlighted that productivity can simply be enhanced by 20-30%  
    by adopting improved varieties and achieving seed replacement rate. Balanced nutrient  
    management and utilizing the harvested rain water or providing supplemental irrigation  
    at critical stages can also boost the productivity of crops by a significant margin, in  
    addition, the high seed rate requirement of groundnut and soybean could be rationalized  
    by selective grading.
2.  Crops can be made more resistant to diseases by seed treatment and adopting balanced  
    used of fertilizers
3.  Capacity utilization of oil industry can be boosted by enhanced production, promoting  
    contract farming, rationalizing duty structure of refined and crude oil.
4.  It is suggested that blending regulations are strictly enforced in respect of labelling to  
    highlight the use of blended oil

1.  Procurement of oilseeds at MSP during the peak arrival seasons will help in encouraging  
    farmers to go for oilseed production.

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

This Mission, having similar components such as incentive for seed, demonstration, and

farm implements including efficient water application tools covered under National Food

Security Mission (NFSM), was merged under revamped NFSM from the year 2018- 19

as NFSM-Oilseeds.

2.2.6 Sub Mission on Agriculture Extension

Background of the Scheme

Previously, SMAE was a sub mission under the National Mission on Agricultural Extension and

Technology (NMAET), however, currently, it has been subsumed as sub-scheme of Umbrella

Scheme- Green Revolution-Krishonnati Yojana from 2017-18. It is aimed at strengthening the

extension machinery. It focuses on awareness creation and enhanced use of appropriate

technologies in agriculture & allied sectors. The schemes component consists of a mix of

extensive physical outreach and enhancement in quality of extension services through inputs

from domain experts.

**Components**^205

It has the following main components:

**A. Centrally Sponsored Schemes**

1.  Support to State Extension Programme for Extension Reforms (ATMA Scheme)

**_B. Central Sector Schemes_**

1.  Mass Media Support to Agricultural Extension
2.  Agri Clinics & Agri Business Centres (ACABC)
3.  Extension Support to Central Institutes
4.  Strengthening/Promoting Agricultural Information System including Kisan Call Centers (KCC)

Given that the mandate is evaluation of CSS, the following sections capture review of ATMA

(Agricultural Technology Management Agency) scheme.

**Objectives**^206

• To make extension system farmer driven and farmer accountable by disseminating

technology to farmers through new institutional arrangements viz. Agricultural

Technology Management Agency (ATMA) at district level to operationalize the extension

reforms on a participatory mode.

• To encourage multi-agency extension strategies involving Public/ Private Extension

Service Providers.

• To ensure an integrated, broad-based extension delivery mechanism consistent with

farming system approach with a focus on bottom up planning process.

• To adopt group approach to extension in line with the identified needs and requirements

of the farmers in the form of CIGs & FIGs and consolidate them as Farmers Producer

Organizations;

• To facilitate convergence of farmer centric programmes in planning, execution and

implementation.

• To address gender concerns by mobilizing farm women into groups and providing

training to them.

**Implementation structure and stakeholders**

State level

The State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) set up under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY)

is the apex body to approve State Extension Work Plan (SEWP), which forms a part of the State

Agriculture Plan (SAP). In case where SLSC meeting cannot be held, or in case of any other

administrative reason, SEWP can be approved by Executive Committee of Sub-Mission on

Agricultural Extension on the recommendation of Inter Departmental Working Group (IDWG).

The SLSC may be supported by the IDWG which is responsible for day-to-day coordination and

management of the Scheme activities within the State. The State Nodal Cell (SNC), consisting of

State Nodal officer, State Coordinator, State Gender Coordinator and supporting staff ensure

timely receipt of District Agriculture Action Plans (DAAPs), formulation of State Extension Work

Plan (SEWP) duly incorporating farmers’ feedback obtained through State Farmer Advisory

Committee (SFAC) and its approval by the SLSC. The SNC then conveys the approval, and monitors

implementation of these work plans by State Agricultural Management & Extension Training

Institutes (SAMETIs) and ATMAs. The SAMETIs also draw-up and execute an Annual Training

Calendar for capacity building of the Extension Functionaries in the State.

District level

ATMA is an autonomous institution set up at district level to ensure delivery of extension services

to farmers. ATMA Governing Board is the apex body of ATMA, which provides overall policy

direction. ATMA Management Committee looks after implementation of the scheme, and District

Farmers Advisory Committee provides farmers’ feedback for district level planning and

implementation. With dedicated staff provided for the ATMA, it will continue to be the district

level nodal agency responsible for overall management of agriculture extension system within

the district, including preparation of Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP).

Block level

The Block ATMA Cell consisting of Block Technology Team (BTT) (a team comprising officers of

agriculture and other allied departments within the block) and Block Farmers’ Advisory

Committee (BFAC) (a group exclusively consisting of selected farmers of the block) prepares the

Block Action Plan (BAP) and provide necessary extension support within the Block in its

execution.

Village level

A Farmer Friend serves as a vital link between extension system and farmers at village level (one

for every two villages). Agri-entrepreneurs, diploma holders in Agricultural Extension Services

for Input Dealers (DAESI), Input Dealers and extension workers in non-governmental sector

supplement the efforts of extension functionaries. Further, Commodity Interest Groups (CIGs),

Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs) and Food Security Groups (FSGs) serve as a nodal point for

information & technology dissemination among its members. Farm schools serve as a mechanism

for farmer-to-farmer extension at every Block.

**Intended contribution to sectoral performance**

Agricultural extension is the application of scientific research and knowledge to agricultural

practices through farmer education. Extension services play a key role in educating farmers on

increasing productivity, improving livelihoods, increasing food security, and promoting

agriculture as an engine of pro-poor economic growth. While various schemes of the GoI focussed

on increasing productivity, only few schemes focussed on how productivity may be enhanced.

There was only limited knowledge among farmers on latest technologies, international best

practices, role of IT, etc. The limited know-how called for extensive physical outreach of

personnel, enhancement in quality through domain experts & regular capacity building,

interactive methods of information dissemination, Public Private Partnership, pervasive &

innovative use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) / Mass Media, Federation of

groups and convergence of extension related efforts under various schemes. The ATMA scheme

was envisaged to appropriately strengthen, expand and up-scale existing Extension and

Information Technology (IT) Schemes.

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

The Mission has high relevance in meeting National Development Agenda as it focusses on making

farming more remunerative through imparting knowledge on increasing production and

productivity, and improving rural infrastructure and value chain. It also seeks to modernize

agriculture through demonstrations, exposure visits, and helping farmers through Kisan Call

Centres.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The Mission aligns with the UN SDGs as well. The scheme focusses on SDG 2a, viz., increase

investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure,

agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock

gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in

particular least developed countries. It does this through strengthening, upscaling and expanding

Extension & Information Technology schemes.

all targets have been missed since 2016-17.

• This indicates that financial targets are being met, there are gaps in meeting physical

targets.

• Financial progress in the scheme has been suffered due to limited progress achieved by

States like Assam, Punjab, Jammu Kashmir and Telangana, second tranche of funds was

not released to these states due to unsatisfactory progress.

significantly and has more than doubled to Rs 84.22 crores in 2018-19 and declined in 2019-20.

However, the numbers of 2019-20 shall be revised as the department is yet to receive utilisation

certificates from many states.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

implemented, need for strong monitoring mechanism to ensure adequate compliance was

highlighted by DFI committee on Agriculture extension. Other important areas of improvement

highlighted by the committee are

• Upgradation of training infrastructure for training institutes and downward trend in

human resource engaged in extension activities

• Information on new schemes and initiatives such as e-NAM, Model APMC act, contract

farming act, 2018 warehousing act also needs to be covered as part of the extension

activities

Data on Outcomes targets is not available for the scheme.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• The scheme’s objectives is on strengthening the extension service mechanisms and

systems across state and thus plays a critical role in dissemination and adoption of

suitable technologies and practices among farmers at the grassroots level.

• SMAE has high relevance in meeting National Development Agenda as it focusses on

making farming more remunerative through imparting knowledge on increasing

production and productivity, and improving rural infrastructure and value chain. It also

seeks to modernize agriculture through demonstrations, exposure visits, and helping

farmers through Kisan Call Centres.

• Some of the indicators that may be measured to assess the scheme continuing relevance

may include no. of hectares under improved technologies or management practices as a

result of extension assistance.

• Since the Scheme also focuses on involving Private Extension Service Providers, the

number of partnerships developed to deliver training service to farmers and number of

farmers trained under such partnerships may also be measured.

**Effectiveness**

• Most of the targets have not been achieved during last 3 years except for number of

demonstrations conducted in 2016-17, and Kisan Mela/ FSI/ Field organized in 2018-19.

• The achievement of targets w.r.t to no. of extension personnel trained has particularly

been low, less than 50% and been declining over the years. About 1,28,792 personnel

were trained in 2016- 17 , followed by 67,198 in 2017-18 and 62,711 in 2018-19. Only

31,517 personnel were trained in 2019-20.

• Resource availability & expertise to operate technology transfer packages plays a critical

role in effective implementation and coverage of extension activities. Therefore, periodic

training of extension functionaries, particularly those operating at district, block and

village level is critical to keep them updated about all technological advancements and

schemes.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• ATMA has not been effectively implemented. The need for strong monitoring mechanism

to ensure adequate compliance was highlighted by DFI committee on agriculture

extension.

• Both public and private extension systems need to focus on sensitizing the farmers on

new practices, more so on climate resilient agriculture to pre-empt risks and failures.

**Efficiency**

• Utilization of funds at the Central Level under the scheme has consistently been above

90% between 2016-17 to 2019-20. The fund allocation has been rising over the years,

except in 2018-19 where the allocation was slightly lower than 2017-18.

• There has been a consistent increase in budget estimates across the years. However every

year there is a gap of 10-15% between budget estimates and revised estimates.

• The scheme has a well-defined monitoring structure in place, with implementing and

monitoring agencies at the levels of state, district, block and village, to ensure that the

extension reforms reach the ground-level. However, the existence of multiple agencies

slows down decision-making and hinders fast-tracking of critical projects.

• The current MIS (ERMS) has very limited data and falls short of expectation on effective

monitoring for the scheme and bringing in efficiency to operations.

**Sustainability**

• As highlighted above, NSSO surveys have highlighted serious concern on the reach of

extension services and level of technology adoption.

• State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and KVKs should be involved not only in

preparation of SREP and Extension Work Plans but also in implementation of various

programmes in the field to ensure that the “lab to land” is effective.

• The scheme has convergence with Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana – RAFTAAR, National

Food Security Mission (NFSM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture

(MIDH), etc. Full convergence of extension-related work being carried out under different

programmes/ schemes should be intended to ensure better sustainability of

interventions.

• Co-opting of private sector resources on extension activities needs be vigorously pursued

with special emphasis (including performance based incentives) for rendering services in

*   rainfed and remote areas, coverage of women and marginalized sections, small and  
    marginal farmers, etc.

**Impact**

• About 676 ATMAs have been established in districts of 29 states and 2 UTs. State

extension work plan have been prepared based on the district agriculture action plan

prepared of ATMA districts.

• Since its inception in 2005-06, Rs 4642.54 crores have been spent over 1,34,702 Farm

schools, over 26,20,294 commodity base interest groups have been mobilised and nearly

5 crores farmers including 24.28% farm women have participated in training and capacity

building activities.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• More than four crore calls have been registered under KCC and 4 regional EEIs have

imparted training to more than 7,500 extension functionaries till December 2018.

• It may be noted that the data on Outcomes indicators, particularly beneficiary level data,

is not available for the scheme.

**Equity**

• The scheme guidelines have directed states to cover 30% women among the beneficiaries.

Analysis of Data received from the Ministry indicates that while women are being given

adequate attention in farmer oriented activities, it still falls short of the targeted inclusion

of 30% women in programmatic activities.

• Women are encouraged to be involved as BTMs and farmer friends. It was highlighted

during KII that more than 50% Farmer Friends in Southern states are women.

• The scheme calls for adequate representation of SC/STs in individual beneficiary

components (training, demonstrations, farm schools, farmer-scientist interactions, and

exposure visits). Moreover, one SC/ST farmer representation is mandatory in the ATMA

governing body. However, no fund is allocated specifically for SC/ST beneficiaries.

Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas

i. Accountability and transparency

The scheme has a nodal structure with committees and agencies at state, district, block, and

village level, leading to strong accountability. The scheme has a monitoring mechanism with

review at IDWG, SNC, ATMA Management Committee, BTT, and Farmer Advisory Committee

levels. At the state level, State Extension Work Plan is approved by either the State Level

Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) set up under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), or the

Executive Committee of Sub-Mission on Agricultural Extension on the recommendation of Inter

Departmental Working Group (IDWG). The State Nodal Cell (SNC), monitors implementation of

these work plans by State Agricultural Management & Extension Training Institutes (SAMETIs)

and ATMAs. At the district level, ATMA Management Committee looks after implementation of the

scheme. At the Block level, a Block Technology Team (BTT) and Block Farmers’ Advisory

Committee (BFAC) provide extension support within the Block. Finally, at the village level, a

Farmer Friend serves as a vital link between extension system and farmers (one for every two

villages). KII discussions highlighted that regular concurrent evaluations are inbuilt in the

scheme. An online web portal, Extension Reforms Management System (ERMS) also exists for the

scheme. However, the data captured therein is quite limited.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Figure 155 : Snapshot of ATMA dashboard/ERMS portal

Source: ATMA scheme dashboard, retrieved from  
https://extensionreforms.dacnet.nic.in/DashBoard\_Statusatma.aspx, accessed on 7 December 2019

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The scheme has a robust monitoring mechanism in place, with implementing and

monitoring agencies at the levels of state, district, block and village, to ensure that the

extension reforms reach the ground-level.

• The information availability regarding the scheme is limited to scheme guidelines,

dashboard, and information available from annual report.

• An online web portal, Extension Reforms Management System (ERMS) also exists for the

scheme. However, the data captured therein includes only physical and financial targets

achieved since 2016-17 (state-wise and cumulative).

• No beneficiary-level data is available.

• There have been two evaluations of the scheme till date – 2010 (AFC Limited), and 2018

(Agro Creative Solutions). Another one is currently ongoing.

• No social audit has been conducted for the scheme.

• The scheme has a robust monitoring mechanism with review at IDWG, SNC, ATMA

Management Committee, BTT, and Farmer Advisory Committee levels.

• No Citizen Charter exists in the scheme.

• Grievances are redressed through CPGRAM and RTI.

• Funds are released for implementing the Scheme before the commencement of sowing

season, normally in two instalments. 50% of the annual allocation are released as First

instalment upon approved SEWP by SLSC/ and Provisional Utilization Certificate (PUC) &

Annual Progress Report (APR) of previous financial year. Release of second instalment

depends upon furnishing of the certain documents, including audited UC, audited

statement of expenditure, monthly progress report of previous month, annual progress

report of previous year, and release of corresponding state share against funds provided

by Central Government up to the previous year.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• DBT is used in the scheme for in-cash and in-kind transfers. It is also used for paying

salaries of Farmer Friend (Rs. 1000 per month).

ii. Direct/Indirect employment generation

The scheme generates huge employment as it recruits permanent and contractual staff at various

levels, such as, Assistant Technology Managers (ATMs) and Block Technology Managers (BTMs),

State Coordinators, Gender Coordinators, Computer Programmer, Deputy Directors, Deputy

Project Directors, Accountants, etc.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The State Nodal Cell (SNC) consists of State Nodal Officer, State Coordinator, Gender

Coordinator and supporting staff.

• At the district level, Project Directors, Project Deputy Directors, an accountant-cum-

establishment clerk, and a computer programmer/operator is recruited.

• On an average, three Assistant Technology Managers (ATMs) and one Block Technology

Manager (BTM) are envisaged per block under this scheme.

• Our KII discussion revealed that 28,000 posts are available under the scheme, of which

14,000 have been filled.

• In addition to this, 1,75,000 Farmer Friends have been employed.

• As per stipulated guidelines, it must be ensured that employees get the emoluments by

insisting on digital/ online mode of payment.

iii. Gender mainstreaming

The scheme was multiple initiatives to cover women beneficiaries, including, budgeted inclusion

of at least 30% women in all programmatic activities, encouragement to women as BTMs and

Farmer Friends, and mobilizing farm women into groups and providing training to them. Further,

a Gender Coordinator is employed at the State level, who ensures flow of benefit to women

farmers. Gender coordinator is also responsible for collection of gender disaggregated data, and

conducting studies and action research in critical thrust areas, promotion of farm women’s Food

Security Groups and preparation of training module so as to ensure household food security.

He/She is also responsible for documentation of the best practices/ Success Stories/ Participatory

Material Production related to women in Agriculture. Data received from the Ministry indicates

that while women are being given adequate attention in farmer oriented activities, it still falls

short of the targeted inclusion of 30% women in programmatic activities.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• The guidelines stipulate that out of the progressive farmers (farmers with requisite

qualification, viz., Senior Secondary/High School, or, farmers with good oral and written

communication skills) nominated, at least one-third must be women

• Minimum 30% of resources meant for programmes and activities are required to be

allocated to women farmers and women extension functionaries with specific

documentation of expenditure and performance for women being maintained.

• At least 30% scheme beneficiaries should be women farmers/ farm women.

— However, this target is not being met currently.

• Gender coordinators are included in the state teams to ensure flow of benefit to women

farmers.

• To ensure household food and nutritional security, Farm Women’s Food Security Groups

(FSGs) @ at least 2 per block are to be formed each year. These FSGs are to be provided

support for training, publication and access to inputs @ Rs. 10000 per group. These FSGs

should serve as “Model Food Security Hubs” through establishing kitchen garden,

backyard poultry, goatery, animal husbandry & dairying, mushroom cultivation, etc.

• Women are encouraged to be involved as BTMs and farmer friends.

— It was highlighted during KII that more than 50% Farmer Friends in Southern states

are women.

iv. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the

scheme in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

In order to ensure adequate representation of vulnerable groups, the scheme has provided

attention to SC/ST and small and marginal farmers. The scheme calls for adequate representation

of SC/STs in individual beneficiary components (training, demonstrations, farm schools, farmer-

scientist interactions, and exposure visits). Moreover, one SC/ST farmer representation is

mandatory in the ATMA governing body. This governing body is also responsible for encouraging

agricultural lending institutions to increase the availability of capital to SC/ST farmers.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The number of SC/ST beneficiaries in the individual farmer-oriented activities (training,

demonstrations, farm schools, farmer-scientist interactions, and exposure visits) is

decided by Block Technology Team (BTT) in consultation with Block Farmer Advisory

Committee (BFAC) so as to have a balanced coverage.

• The ATMA governing body must have at least one SC/ST farmer representative.

• While nominating Progressive Farmers, states must have adequate representation from

SC/ST categories.

• The guidelines stipulate that among the progressive farmers (farmers with requisite

qualification, viz., Senior Secondary/High School, or, farmers with good oral and written

communication skills) nominated, adequate representation must be given to SC/ST

farmers.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

v. Use of IT/technology in driving efficiency

Use of ICT interventions is of paramount importance in extension services, both- in terms of

improving the outreach as well as the quality of information and knowledge being imparted to

farmers. The scheme thus encourages sending out advisories, including those for crop

management, weather, market price, etc. and also uses innovative tools like pico projectors, hand-

held devices for recording farm data. In addition, farmers are empowered to seek information by

contacting the Kisan Call Centres (KCCs) currently located at 14 stations in different parts of the

country through a Toll free number. A study revealed that KCC was the most important source of

information to the farmers followed by fellow farmers, input dealers, Kisan melas etc^212.

The scheme also utilizes a central database (ERMS) wherein states upload data on the physical

and financial progress of extension activities. However, the extent of data captured on this

database is fairly limited, with information on number of trainings, demonstrations, exposure

visits, farmer schools, etc. in each state, and expenditure on training and on extension functionary.

vi. Development, dissemination & adoption of innovative practices, technology & know-

how

The scheme encourages adoption of innovative methods of technology dissemination such as

production of low-cost films, public viewing of such films using pico projectors and display

boards. It also promotes use of hand held devices / smart phones for recording farm data, and

dissemination of information through street shows, extension buses, certified crop advisors, etc.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• No fixed allocation is made in the scheme for carrying out innovative activities.

• The scheme promotes production of low cost films on specific themes (preferably directed

by farmers themselves so as to have greater acceptability among the audience) and

broadcast of the same through pico/ultra-light portable projectors (which can function

without laptop) for disseminating best agricultural practices. The films are also to be

made available on the internet.

• Hand held devices/smartphones may be used for data gathering to ensure whether full

yield potential of a crop has been achieved by the farmer (and what he needs to do to

minimize the gap) and whether the farmers need to shift to some other crop.

• Geographic Information System (GIS) based analysis of data shall be carried out for better

macro level planning and also for micro level detailing for a village or even a field.

• Methods such as ‘ Kala Jathas’ (road shows) , Wall Posters, Extension Buses, Certified Crop

Advisors etc. have been tried successfully in some States to deliver the message effectively

and informally in an interactive manner.

vii. Research & Development

The 12th Plan Approach Paper identified several challenges faced by the agricultural extension

and gave suggestions to deal with the same. Some of these include integrating Krishi Vigyan

Kendra’s (KVKs) problem solving skills and the feedback they provide to State Agriculture

Universities (SAUs) and National Agriculture Research System (NARS) with ATMA and strengthen

district level planning. In light of this, the scheme coordinates and collaborates with KVKs and

ICAR for its research needs. Further, the scheme encourages Research-Extension-Farmer (R-E-F)

linkages at district and block levels. These activities include organization of Farmer-Scientist

Interaction at local level, joint visits by scientist and extension personnel, organization of Field-

days and KisanGoshties and support for local level researchable issues which emanate from

Strategic Research and Extension Plan (SREP).

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and KVKs have to be fully involved not only in

preparation of SREP and Extension Work Plans but also in implementation of various

programmes in the field.

− They are to be represented in all bodies, namely, ATMA GB and ATMA MC in districts,

SLSC/ IDWGs at State level, and BTT / BFAC Meetings at Block level. In addition, each

KVK scientist may be made in charge of one or more Blocks within the district.

− The KVK Scientist offers technical advice to the BTT and is also actively involved in

preparation of Block Agricultural Plans, especially with regard to research related

issues/gaps and strategies.

• The ATMA governing Board is also responsible for receiving and allocating project funds

for carrying out priority research, extension and related activities within the district.

• Farmer Scientist interactions at district level provide a platform for addressing farmers’

concerns on new technologies developed by research institutes and help in bringing forth

various technological options for the coming season which suited to the local situations.

• However, no funds are specifically earmarked for R&D activities.

**_viii. Unlocking synergies with other government programmes_**

Being such a large scheme, with so many components, the scheme is bound to have convergence

with other schemes. The scheme has convergence with Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana – RAFTAAR,

National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture

(MIDH), etc. The scheme also has convergence with KVKs.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The SLSC set up under RKVY-RAFTAAR is the apex governing body responsible for

approving SEWP in ATMA.

• District plans under the scheme need to be designed so as to serve of the CDAPs prepared

for the district under RKVY-RAFTAAR.

• Funds for extension activities may use funds from RKVY-RAFTAAR as well.

• Basic IT infrastructure provided to SAMETIs and State/District ATMAs may be

supplemented under AGRISNET, NeGP-A, RKVY-RAFTAAR and other schemes.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• ATMA Governing Body acts as an over-arching umbrella at District level to oversee all

extension related activities in other Missions like National Horticulture Mission (NHM)/

Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Food Security

Mission (NFSM), RKVY- RAFTAAR, and other schemes of Krishonnati Yojana.

• The guidelines stipulate that there should be full convergence of extension-related work

being carried out under different programmes/schemes.

• Scientists in the KVKs advise and mentor BTTs in identifying technological needs in

various blocks in the district and programmatic interventions to meet such needs.

• Project Director, ATMA and Programme Coordinator of KVK jointly visit at least five

villages every month in the district to guide and supervise the extension-related work

assigned to scientists and the extension workers. At the ends of the month, a joint progress

report is submitted by these officials to the Secretary & the Director (Agriculture & allied

departments) of the State and the Vice Chancellor of SAU.

ix. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives and civil

society in the scheme

The scheme guidelines stipulate that at least 10% of scheme allocation on recurring activities at

district level is to be incurred through Non-Governmental Sector viz. Corporate sector, NGOs, FOs,

PRIs, Cooperatives, Para-Extension Workers, Agri-preneurs, Input Suppliers, etc. in Service

Provider or Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. The private sector organizations may be

involved in extension activities in PPP mode only if they share the capital &/or recurring

expenditure to the extent of at least 50%. The Government support for PPP activities herein will

not exceed 50%. In addition, industrial units and large public sector undertakings can be targeted

for CSR support. Activities and interventions that require further financial support can be

targeted through CSR route by developing a partnership with NGOs and training institutions. The

NGOs and training institute can approach the corporate entities for CSR funds and the department

can provide endorsement through a letter of support, which will help them in getting funds.

Box 8 : e-Choupal initiative by ITC

Case Study: e-Choupal initiative by ITC

Introduction/Challenge:

ITC's Agri Business Division, one of India's largest exporters of agricultural commodities,

conceived e-Choupal as an efficient supply chain aimed at delivering value to its customers

around the world on a sustainable basis. The concept was conceived to tackle the challenge posed

by the unique features of Indian agriculture characterized by small, fragmented farms, weak

infrastructure, and the involvement of numerous intermediaries.

Solution:

The initiative attempts to take the concept of agricultural extension services from the Internet to

the farm. E-Choupal is a virtual market place where farmers can do the transaction, facilitated by

an internet linked computer, directly with a purchaser and can realize better price for their

produce. E-choupals are village Internet kiosks that enable access to information on weather,

market prices and scientific farm practices. The initiative offers farmers required information,

products and services they need to enhance farm productivity, improve farm-gate price

realizations and cut transaction costs.

The company provides the infrastructure for the choupal, including a computer, a printer, UPS

system, solar panel and internet connectivity through VSAT. Each kiosk is run by a local farmer

(sanchalak), selected from the village and provided with short training. The sanchalak provides

the space and has to meet other operational expenditures such as electricity charges. Farmers

are free to use this facility and there is no fee or registration charge.

Impact:

• Launched in June 2000, the company has so far established 6,450 kiosks across eight states

(Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and

Tamil Nadu). The services reach more than 35,000 villages, benefitting over 40 lakh farmers

growing soybean, coffee, wheat, rice, pulses and shrimp, through 6,100 installations.

• The company has also launched a flagship extension programme called 'Choupal Pradarshan

Khet' (CPK) or demonstration plots to help farmers enhance farm productivity by adopting

agricultural best practices.

− It is also currently working with agri-startups for providing many services including

location specific weather forecasts, crop advisory, quality testing of crops, etc. to farmers.

As per company report, of the 10 lakh beneficiaries under CPK, incomes of around 34,000

farmers have doubled (107% growth) by adopting all the practices and recommended

inputs. The balance farmers' income has also shown an income increase of 30% to 75%,

depending on adoption of various recommended practices.

Discussion on sector specific thematic assessment

The scheme guidelines stipulate that at least 10% of scheme allocation on recurring activities at

district level is to be incurred through Non-Governmental Sector viz. Corporate sector, NGOs, FOs,

PRIs, Cooperatives, Para-Extension Workers, Agri-preneurs, Input Suppliers, etc. in Service

Provider or Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. There is immense potential for private

players and start-ups to extend their services in the space. They may be involved in extension

activities in PPP mode only if they share the capital and/or recurring expenditure to the extent of

at least 50%. Even though the guidelines encourage private sector involvement, the linkage

between private sector and public sector extension is still weak. Naturally, private players/start-

ups would be inclined to providing support on activities that match their commercial interests.

Private extension, when available is more active in irrigated areas, where more intensive and

commercial crops are raised; in dealing with big farmers; in plantation areas; and in promoting

their own products in rest of the areas. In the process, the larger majority constituting the small

and marginal farmers, especially in rainfed and remote areas are left unattended to by private

sector. In such spaces, either the private parties would need to be given additional incentives for

investment, or the public extension services can play a more dominant role. It is important to

support and coordinate private sector extension for providing end-to-end solutions to farmers.

Additional manpower from private sector involvement may be used to expand extension outreach

to more farmers and regions. These parties may also be leveraged to develop and maintain central

database for project monitoring. Given that these players are more open to risk-taking, they may

be engaged in R&D activities, and be given an opportunity to bring out newer ways to reach out

to farmers and end-beneficiaries. Private players may also be interested in developing state-of-

the-art training centers, demonstration farms, nurseries, model production units, etc.

Issues and Challenges

Some of the major issues and challenges in the scheme are as follows:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The scheme has a nodal structure with committees and agencies at state, district, block, and  
    village level, leading to strong accountability. The scheme has a monitoring mechanism with  
    review at IDWG, SNC, ATMA Management Committee, BTT, and Farmer Advisory  
    Committee levels. At the state level, State Extension Work Plan is approved by either the  
    State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) set up under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana  
    (RKVY), or the Executive Committee of Sub-Mission on Agricultural Extension on the  
    recommendation of Inter Departmental Working Group (IDWG). The State Nodal Cell (SNC),  
    monitors implementation of these work plans by State Agricultural Management &  
    Extension Training Institutes (SAMETIs) and ATMAs. At the district level, ATMA  
    Management Committee looks after implementation of the scheme. At the Block level, a  
    Block Technology Team (BTT) and Block Farmers’ Advisory Committee (BFAC) provide  
    extension support within the Block. Finally, at the village level, a Farmer Friend serves as a  
    vital link between extension system and farmers (one for every two villages). While this  
    ensures a robust implementation mechanism and accountability at each level, the existence  
    of multiple agencies slows down decision-making and hinders fast-tracking of critical  
    projects. Typically, such a scenario would lead to delay in starting of projects and  
    consequent delay in disbursement of funds. By the time the funds are released, there may

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

also be a rise in raw material and project cost, rendering the whole mechanism less fruitful.

This also adds to the administrative work as reporting is to be done at all these levels.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  Funds are released for implementing the Scheme before the commencement of sowing  
    season, normally in two instalments. 50% of the annual allocation are released as First  
    instalment upon approved SEWP by SLSC/ and Provisional Utilization Certificate (PUC) &  
    Annual Progress Report (APR) of previous financial year. Release of second instalment  
    depends upon furnishing of the certain documents, including audited UC, audited statement  
    of expenditure, monthly progress report of previous month, annual progress report of  
    previous year, and release of corresponding state share against funds provided by Central  
    Government up to the previous year. Utilization of funds under ATMA has been over 90%  
    since 2016-17 (See Figure below), which reflects positively for the fund flow efficiency.  
    However, the present fund routing mechanism wherein funds are transferred to  
    department/implementing agencies through State exchequer hinders the overall progress  
    and affect utilisation. This is mainly due to the delay observed in routing the funds from  
    State to implementing agencies. This is one of the primarily reason why states are not able  
    to utilise their funds on time.

Despite this, targets have been missed across all activities except for number of

This indicates that while financial targets have been achieved, there is a significant gap in

achievement of physical targets. Another noteworthy point is that even though targets are

not being achieved, the targets for subsequent years are being set higher across a number

of activities. Gap also exists in the inclusion of women in farmer-oriented activities

(currently less than targeted 30%), as depicted in Table 55 ).

C. Capacity building

1.  Capacity building is the primary objective of the scheme as it is through training and  
    development that production and productivity may be increased. There is a gap between  
    targets set and achieved in terms of capacity building, as may be seen from Table 56 above.
2.  ATMA was envisioned to facilitate linking farmers to market so as to ensure decent price  
    realisation. Despite this, most extension services are restricted to advisory on production  
    aspects, without catering to marketing concerns. Extension functionaries are neither  
    trained, nor are they made accountable for the targeted outcomes^213. The extension  
    manpower basically suffers from inadequate knowledge or market-centric capabilities as  
    their orientation and training content has culturally been production-centric^214. This gap  
    needs to be addresses on priority.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  While implementation and monitoring mechanism is in place at Centre, State, District, Block  
    and village levels, a robust ICT-enabled mechanism needs to be established. The current  
    MIS (ERMS) has very limited data and falls short of expectation on effective monitoring for  
    the scheme.

1.  A new ICT-enabled system will need to be adequately supported with participatory tools of  
    social assessments involving all stakeholders, which is not currently the case. It would also  
    need to be user-friendly so as to be able to adequately serve people across different  
    educational backgrounds. Given that the scheme encourages involvement of private parties,  
    this mechanism may be developed and maintained by private players. The system should  
    also enable development of a common repository of tested technologies.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the key recommendations for the scheme:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  A project approval and disbursal flow can be developed and timeline for each activity needs  
    to be fixed. Timelines of project approval and disbursal of funds must then be strictly  
    adhered to. The department may fix accountability of officers at each level to ensure  
    adherence to timelines. Delay in routing of funds from state exchequer to implementation  
    agencies can be checked by sending funds directly to state implementation agencies for  
    important components. The department can classify and prioritize such activities and  
    identify implementing agencies in State

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  Since the Scheme also focuses on involving Private Extension Service Providers, the number  
    of partnerships developed to deliver training service to farmers and number of farmers  
    trained under such partnerships may also be measured.
2.  ATMA has not been effectively implemented. The need for strong monitoring mechanism to  
    ensure adequate compliance was highlighted by DFI committee on Agriculture extension.  
    Other important areas of improvement highlighted by the committee include upgradation  
    of training infrastructure of training institutes and strengthening of human resource  
    engaged in extension activities which has shown a declining trend. Information on new  
    schemes and initiatives such as e-NAM, Model APMC Act, Contract Farming Act, 2018,  
    Warehousing Act, etc. should also be covered as part of the extension activities

o As mentioned in the earlier section, both public and private extension systems

should focus on sensitizing the farmers on new practices, more so on climate

resilient agriculture to pre-empt risks and failures.

o Co-opting of private sector resources including interventions under Corporate

Social Responsibility (CSR) on extension activities must be vigorously pursued

with special emphasis (including performance based incentives) for rendering

services in - rainfed and remote areas; coverage of women and marginalised

sections, small and marginal farmers etc. Examples of such co-option could be

setting-up and operating state-of-the-art training centers, agri-clinics and

multipurpose service centres, demonstration farms, nurseries etc. including

development of interactive ICT tools, training / Human Resource Development /

consultancy activities in specialized areas.

1.  The scheme guidelines have directed states to cover 30% women among the beneficiaries.  
    Analysis of Data received from the Ministry indicates that while women are being given  
    adequate attention in farmer oriented activities, it still falls short of the targeted inclusion  
    of 30% women in programmatic activities. The gender coordinators at state level must  
    ensure that the targets are being met.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  Utilization of funds at the Central Level under the scheme has consistently been above 90%  
    between 2016-17 to 2019-20. The fund allocation has been rising over the years, except  
    in 2018-19 where the allocation was slightly lower than 2017-18. Most of the targets have  
    not been achieved during this period except for number of demonstrations conducted in  
    2016 - 17, and Kisan Mela/FSI/Field organized in 2018-19.

o The achievement of targets w.r.t to no. of extension personnel trained has

particularly been low, less than 50% and been declining over the years. In, 2016-

17 about 1,28,792 personnel were trained, 67,198 in 2017-18, 62,711 in 2018- 19

and only 31,517 in 2019-18.

o Resource availability & expertise to operate technology transfer packages plays a

critical role in effective implementation and coverage of extension activities.

Therefore, periodic training of extension functionaries, particularly those

operating at district, block and village level is critical to keep them updated about

all technological advancements and schemes. The department also needs to

classify and prioritize important activities for which funds can be directly

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

transferred to implementing agencies to prevent the delay in routing of funds

from state exchequer to implementation agencies.

C. Capacity building

1.  The gap between the target and achievement needs to be closed effectively. The process of  
    setting targets needs to be analysed. The costs of training, transportation, hiring trainers,  
    extension materials etc. have to be accounted for while setting targets. Rationalising targets  
    in line with the costs will help in realistic assessment of goals and will lead to more effective  
    implementation.
2.  The extension functionaries are to be trained and made accountable for the targeted  
    outcomes^215. Market centric capabilities and knowledge about the value chain, price  
    realisation etc. needs to be developed across the extension functionaries through trainings  
    and capacity building. Incentives can be designed for extension functionaries who  
    demonstrate market-centric capabilities and orient the farmers towards making better  
    profits.
3.  The report of the Committee on Doubling Farmers Income^216 highlighted that capacity  
    building of extension functionaries was not sustained, leading to achievement of less-than-  
    potential outcomes. This, combined with attrition-ridden and unstable contractual  
    manpower has been responsible for non-achievement of targets. The report also pointed  
    out that both public and private extension systems highlight on “what to do”, rather than  
    also educating on “what not to do”. The latter is equally critical for farmers who are  
    practising agriculture from generations and are thus sticking to traditional practices. The  
    farmers, thus, need to be sensitized not only in new practices but also on the need or  
    ineffectiveness of ongoing habits to pre-empt risks and failures.
4.  State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and KVKs should be involved not only in preparation  
    of SREP and Extension Work Plans but also in implementation of various programmes in  
    the field to ensure that the “lab to land” is effective.
5.  Separate component may be included under the scheme for creating more awareness about  
    climate change and sustainability or disaster risk reduction and best practices.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  The scheme has a well-defined monitoring structure in place, with implementing and  
    monitoring agencies at the levels of state, district, block and village, to ensure that the  
    extension reforms reach the ground-level. However, the existence of multiple agencies  
    slows down decision-making and hinders fast-tracking of critical projects. A robust  
    centralized ICT-enabled mechanism needs to be implemented which can help in smooth  
    monitoring and help in better analysis of information as the current MIS (ERMS) has very  
    limited data and falls short of expectation on effective monitoring for the scheme.
2.  The monitoring mechanism needs to be an integral part of an ICT based platform with  
    applications that support use of participatory tools of social assessments involving all  
    stakeholders – Farmers Advisory Committees, Civil Society Groups, representatives of Line

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

departments and Peer institutions etc. and supported with adequate financial outlay. This

platform should also acts as a common repository of validated knowledge and tested

technologies to allow for more effective and credible extension activities.

1.  The output indicators largely cover the intended objectives of the scheme. However, many  
    of the output indicators are also used as outcome indicators. Therefore, there is a need to  
    revisit the outcome indicators in-line with the objectives of the scheme for determining the  
    actual outcomes. For example, the number of trained farmers adopting learned new  
    technologies should be used as outcome indicator instead of number of farmers trained.  
    One of the ways to assess number of farmers trained who have adopted new technologies  
    could include conducting a sample survey of the farmers who underwent training under the  
    scheme.

o Other indicators that may be measured to assess the scheme performance may

include no. of hectares under improved technologies or management practices as

a result of extension assistance. Similarly, to assess the performance w.r.t to

gender inclusiveness and mainstreaming the number of women participating in

the training programmes should also be tracked. For output tracking, the number

of common interest groups & farmer interest groups associated with the Scheme

may be measured.

1.  Data on Outcomes indicators, particularly beneficiary level data, is not available for the  
    scheme. No social audit undertaken have limited the assessment of scheme effectiveness,  
    efficiency and impact. Given the large coverage of the scheme in terms of activities and sub-  
    sectors, there is a need to conduct periodic assessments including outcome and process  
    evaluations.
2.  Specific incentives for women should be included under the scheme to promote their  
    participation. The data on women beneficiaries and those belonging to SC/ ST should be  
    monitored on a continuous basis to ensure inclusiveness and meeting the targeted coverage
3.  There is not much participation of private sector players. Start-ups may particularly be  
    encouraged to engage in extension activities.

E. Convergence with other schemes and programs

1.  The scheme has convergence with Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana – RAFTAAR, National Food  
    Security Mission (NFSM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), etc.  
    Full convergence of extension-related work being carried out under different  
    programmes/schemes should be intended to enhance scheme coverage and impact and  
    efficient resource utilization.

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

This scheme is now sub-mission of the National Mission on Agricultural Extension and

Technology (NMAET). The Scheme guidelines of NMAET mention that the common

threads running across all 4 Sub-Missions are Extension & Technology. The scheme

aims to restructure & strengthen agricultural extension to enable delivery of appropriate

technology and improved agronomic practices to the farmers. This is envisaged to be

achieved by:

*   A mix of physical outreach & interactive methods of information  
    dissemination
*   Use of ICT
*   Popularization of modern and appropriate technologies
*   Capacity building and institution strengthening to promote mechanization
*   Availability of quality seeds, plant protection etc.
*   Encourage the aggregation of farmers into Interest Groups (FIGs) to form  
    Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)

2.2.7 Sub Mission on Agriculture Mechanisation

Background of the Scheme

SMAM is an important sub-mission under National Mission on Agricultural Extension and

Technology (NMAET). SMAM was conceived after merging the central sector schemes on

‘Promotion and Strengthening of Agricultural Mechanisation through Training, Testing and

Demonstration’ and ‘Post Harvest Technology & Management’. Strong correlation is also seen

between farm power availability and improved productivity. To cope up the increasing demand

of food there is a need to increase the availability of farmer power from 1.841 kW per Ha (2012-

1.  to 4.0 kW per Ha by 2030. This sub-mission was designed to promote the usage of farm

mechanization and increase the ratio of farm power to cultivable unit area up to 2 kW/Ha.

**Objectives of the scheme**^217

• Increasing the reach of farm mechanization to small and marginal farmers and to the

regions where availability of farm power is low;

• Promoting ‘Custom Hiring Centres’ to offset the adverse economies of scale arising due to

small landholding and high cost of individual ownership;

• Creating hubs for hi-tech & high value farm equipment;

• Creating awareness among stakeholders through demonstration and capacity building

activities;

• Ensuring performance testing and certification at designated testing centers located all

over the country.

**Components**^218

• Promotion and Strengthening of Agricultural Mechanization through Training, Testing

and Demonstration

• Demonstration, Training and Distribution of Post-Harvest Technology and Management

(PHTM)

• Financial Assistance for Procurement of Agriculture Machinery and Equipment

• Establish Farm Machinery Banks for Custom Hiring

• Establish Hi-Tech, High Productive Hub Equipment Hub for Custom Hiring

• Promotion of Farm Mechanisation in selected villages

• Financial assistance for production of mechanized operations/hectares carried out

through custom hiring centres

• Promotion of farm machinery and equipment in North Eastern Region

**Implementation structure and stakeholders**

The mission has a National Steering Committee (NSC) under the chairmanship of Secretary,

Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The Joint secretary, Mechanisation and Technology (M&T) is

the member secretary of the NSC. Other members of the NSC include Additional Secretaries of

(^217) Annual report 2018-19 DACFW  
(^218) Annual report 2018-19 DACFW

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

M&T and Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare and Joint Secretaries looking after

other important agriculture schemes where mechanisation is being supported such as MIDH and

RKVY and experts from ICAR. NSC is responsible for overall review and responsible for

formulating or reviewing operational guidelines.

The Executive Committee (EC), chaired by Additional Secretary (M&T) looks after overall

execution of the scheme and is responsible for overseeing mission activities and approval of

annual action plan submitted by states. EC is empowered to reallocate resources across the states,

EC can also approve special interventions and flexi funds under the scheme. To support EC in

decision making, M&T division plays an active role and provide technical inputs. The M&T

division also help in establishing constant coordination with states, help in publicity of the scheme

and concurrent evaluation of states. For technical guidance and support, EC has expert members

from ICAR, Horticulture, Crops, Production Engineering divisions and CFMTTI, Budni.

The implementation at state level is the responsibility of State Level Executive Committee (SLEC)

chaired by Agricultural Production Commissioner/Principal Secretary. The SLEC is responsible

for vetting annual plans and implementation of mission activities in the state. The Director

agriculture/Agriculture engineering is the member secretary of SLEC and Director Horticulture

is the co-member secretary. Representatives of State agricultural university, line departments

and ICAR forms other members of the committee. The department of agriculture engineering or

agriculture at state level are the nodal department at state level for implementation of mission

activities. The nodal department is responsible for overall planning, coordination and

implementation of mission activities. The nodal department is also responsible for ensuring

convergence with other departmental schemes and forming an indicative list of machinery and

equipment which should not be subsidized in the state. While the nodal department oversee the

state level implementation, the district level planning is done by District Level Executive

Committee (DLEC), headed by District collector. DLEC helps in identifying the areas within district

with low farm power ration, preparation of district level plans, ensuring convergence with others

schemes, tie ups with banks and PRI institutions for implementation of mission activities at state

level. Component 1 and Component 2 are 100% centrally funded whereas other components have

state share of 40% (and 10% for hilly and north eastern states). For component 1 and 2, the funds

are directly transferred to implementing agencies.

**Intended contribution to sectoral challenges**

Farm power contributes directly to agriculture production and productivity. India has seen

growth in adoption of farm machinery and equipment in recent years as push for agricultural

mechanisation has increased average farm power availability from 1.8 kW/Ha in 2012-13 to 2.02

kW/Ha in 2017-18. The sub-mission on agriculture mechanisation has been designed to increase

the ratio of farm power available to cultivable area up to 2.5 kW/Ha. High correlation is observed

with farm power availability and production as the high producing regions of Punjab, Haryana

and Western Uttar Pradesh have higher farm power availability than national average. The

Mission envisages inclusive growth of farm mechanization with specific focus on regions with low

farm power availability. Within states, districts with low farm power availability are identified for

interventions.

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

The scheme through its components contributes directly towards national development

objectives of doubling farmer’s income, employment generation and entrepreneurship

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

development. NITI Aayog’s ‘Strategy for New India @ 75’ has outlined doubling farmers’ income

as priority area for national development. Mechanisation helps in contributing towards improved

income by reducing drudgery and saving time, helps in efficient utilisation of inputs and most

importantly contribute toward increased productivity by ensuring availability of farm power.

In addition, the scheme also contribute towards attaining targets under following SDGs:

Goal 1: No poverty- Scheme is essentially supporting areas and district which have low farm

power availability, CHCs are being promoted so the small and marginal farmers can rent and use

machinery for agricultural use.

Goal 2: Zero Hunger- By promoting mechanisation which ultimately aid increased productivity

Goal 8: By promoting mechanisation to reduce drudgery and increase farm power availability to

increase productivity and promoting post-harvest technology for value addition

Goal 9: Promoting Industry innovation and infrastructure for livestock sector by promoting milk

processing and marketing infrastructure

Goal 17: Partnership for goals are being created through this programme by establishing

convergence with other schemes such as RKVY and MIDH

As can be seen, SMAM is a major scheme with an overall budgeted outlay of more than Rs 3300

cores since 2014-15. It can be seen that the budgeted expenditure for the scheme has risen

sharply in recent years. BE tripled in 2017-18 than that of previous year and then more than

doubled subsequently in 2018-19. The overall fund utilisation under the scheme in comparison

to BE and RE is more than 100% and 97% respectively. Between 2014-15 and 2018-19, the

consolidated RE (Rs 2455.2 crores) and Expenditure (Rs 2614.5 crores) for the years has been

higher than BE (2343.7). This is an indicator of good scheme progress, sufficient utilisation and

adequate availability of funds. For 2019-20, more than 65% of funds have been utilised till

November which indicates satisfactory progress in utilisation of funds.

**Achievements**^220

• The evaluation report by WAPCOS on SMAM highlights overall positive impact of

mechanisation on farming as it was reported that mechanisation helped in overall

increase of 17.9% in productivity and 14.1% in germination. Mechanisation also helped

in saving nearly 1/3rd of the time of operations, 30% reduction in labour requirements,

11% reduction in seed rate, 26.6% reduction in weed instances, 22.4% reduction in diesel

consumption and 12.7% reduction in fertiliser requirements.

**Observations**

• The targets of the key output indicators are not available for the mentioned period (i.e.

from 2014-15 to 2017 - 18)

• As on November 2019 Andhra Pradesh received the highest 13.6% of total funds released,

followed by Tamil Nadu 10.7%, Karnataka 9.9%, Maharashtra 9.8% and Odisha 7.6%.

• Till November 2019 more than 75% of training and 33% of demonstrations under the

scheme have been carried out by FMTTIS.

• Among the states maximum demonstration of machinery has been done by Punjab (20%)

followed by JK, MP and Haryana other states have not achieved significant progress

• Andhra Pradesh has received the highest funding and provided financial support to the

highest number of machines (22.6%), followed by MP (14.9%), Karnataka (10%), UP

(9.6%) and Chattisgarh (6.8%).

• Kerala has established more than 3100 custom hiring centres (26.3%), followed by Odisha

(13.3%) and Tamil Nadu (12.8%). 70% of CHCs have been established in five states,

therefore the distribution is skewed and there is need to encourage CHCs across all states.

• 151(67%) Hi tech hubs have been established in Karnataka, none of the states apart from

MP (22 hubs) has made any significant progress in establishing Hi tech hubs

• UP (19.8%) Tamil Nadu(14.2%) and Punjab (12.9%) are the top states in establishing

Farm machinery banks

• Andhra Pradesh has achieved progress across all indicators this indicates that proposals

from AP have been focused on all areas from establishing CHC, carrying out

demonstrations, distributing machinery to establishing Farm machinery banks

• While the mission has shown progress in financial and physical achievements, NSSO

survey and NITI Aayog reports highlighted the low level of technology adoption as an area

of concern^222

• With small land holding and limited usage purchase and maintenance of farm machinery

is not economical for small and marginal farmers, farmer groups, custom hiring services

and farmer machinery banks needs to be promoted in areas with large mechanization

• A separate mission for in-situ management of crop residue management has been

launched in 2018-19 to control crop residue burning in Punjab, UP, Haryana and NCT

Delhi.

• While in-situ management of crop residue has many potential advantage it can also lead

to nutrient immobilization and microbial infestation that can affect productivity

negatively^223

hubs established and number of Hi-Tech hubs established.

The outcome indicator wise targets and achievements were not available.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• SMAM through its components contributes directly towards national development

objectives of doubling farmer’s income, employment generation and entrepreneurship

development.

• The scheme intends to increase the reach of farm mechanization to small and marginal

farmers and to the regions where availability of farm power is low. It also aims to create

awareness among stakeholders through demonstration. Therefore, it is a fairly relevant

scheme considering benefits of farm mechanization and post-harvest equipment in

agriculture sector.

• SMAM has been designed to increase the ratio of farm power available to cultivable area

up to 2.5 KW/Ha. High correlation is observed with farm power availability and

production as the high producing regions of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh

have higher farm power availability than national average.

• More than 60% of the CHCs are owned by rural entrepreneurs and 17.2% are owned by

SHG members, about 4.1% are owned by FPOs and about 16.4% belong to NGOs/

Cooperatives/ KVK or corporate sector. It may be more relevant to focus on FPOs/ FPCs/

SHG members to increase their participation in the scheme.

• The output indicators may also include an indicator on the number of renewable energy

based farm equipment procured and post-harvest units established. This would indicate

the extent of adoption of such environment friendly equipment, considering the

importance of renewable energy in terms of both environmental sustainability and farm

profitability.

**Effectiveness**

• In terms of physical progress, the targets of the key output indicators are not available for

the mentioned period (i.e. from 2014 - 15 to 2017-18). Year wise targets should be defined

for the scheme period for effective assessment of the scheme.

• The targets for the output and outcome indicators are available for 2018-19. In 2018-19,

the scheme over achieved the target for giving financial assistance for procurement of

agricultural machinery/ equipment whereas it could not achieve the other targets such as

number of CHC hubs established and number of Hi-Tech hubs established.

• Similarly, the outcome indicator wise targets and achievements were not available. It is

recommended to measure the output and outcome indicator wise achievements yearly to

assess the effectiveness of the scheme.

• There is variation in progress of different states under the scheme. Among the states

maximum demonstration of machinery has been done by Punjab (20%) followed by JK,

MP and Haryana.

• There is variation in progress in different activities covered under the scheme. Most of the

interventions are focused on increasing farm power and primary processing units. Very

few proposals come up for crop residue management interventions.

• As mentioned, delay in progress of activities and processing of funds is observed for

components where state’s contribution is required.

• A separate mission for in-situ management of crop residue management has been

launched in 2018-19 to control crop residue burning in Punjab, UP, Haryana and NCT

Delhi.

**Efficiency**

• Overall performance of the scheme has been satisfactory. As mentioned earlier, the overall

fund utilisation under the scheme in comparison to BE and RE is more than 100% and

97% respectively. Between 2014-15 and 2018-19, the consolidated RE (Rs 2455.2 crores)

and Actual Expenditure (Rs 2614.5 crores) for the years has been higher than BE (2343.7).

This indicates good scheme progress and satisfactory utilization of funds.

• Some variation in utilization of the scheme can be noted across the years and it ranges

from 97% to 121% over last 4 years.

• The status of post-harvest technology and their potential can also be taken into account

along with farm power availability for selection of districts for promoting mechanisation.

This would ensure that the scheme is also aligned to its other objective of development of

post-harvest technology and infrastructure.

• As mentioned earlier, the scheme focuses on increasing farm power by promoting

machinery that consumes energy and is more resource intensive.

**Sustainability**

• Standalone mechanisation without effective marketing to ensure increased prices for the

farmers may not lead to increase in farmers’ income. Mechanisation efforts needs to be

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

supplemented by better marketing of produce. Hence, convergence with agri-marketing

schemes is critical for success of the farm mechanization.

• As mentioned earlier, most of the trainees under FMTTIs are from nearby region.

Considering the effectiveness of the training in the FMTTIs, there is a need for including

people from distant places for more comprehensive coverage of beneficiaries.

• Demonstration activity is critical to encourage adoption of farm mechanization amongst

farmers.

• Testing of equipment needs to become faster. Institutes such as IARI PUSA, RAU PUSA and

IIT Kharagpur, etc. need to perform better and speed up testing activities.

• The state departments may be encouraged to recruit qualified technical experts such as

qualified agriculture engineers.

**Impact**

• The scheme has made a positive impact through implementation of various interventions.

The evaluation report by WAPCOS on SMAM highlights overall positive impact of

mechanisation on farming as it was reported that mechanisation helped in overall

increase of 17.9% in productivity and 14.1% in germination. Mechanisation also helped

in saving nearly 1/3rd of the time of operations, 30% reduction in labour requirements,

11% reduction in seed rate, 26.6% reduction in weed instances, 22.4% reduction in diesel

consumption and 12.7% reduction in fertiliser requirements.

• The equipment tested and certified under the scheme along with the established cost

norms can act as ready reference for other schemes that are providing subsidized

machinery/ equipment. For example, schemes such as RKVY, MIDH, etc. may benefit due

to adoption of such certified standards and cost norms.

• The outcome indicator wise targets and achievements were not available. Measurement

of progress of outcome indicators vis-à-vis targets are critical for measuring the impacts

of the scheme.

**Equity**

• There is focus on encouraging mechanisation among farmers with special focus on women

to reduce their drudgery. Within the scheme, there are higher subsidy percentage for

women beneficiaries. However, the latest data on women beneficiary under the scheme is

not available.

• The data on benefits availed by women farmers is not being maintained by all states

during the scheme evaluation. Only 7 states provided information on funds utilised for

women farmers and it was observed that 10.2% of total funds utilised under the scheme

were for women farmers. Hence, there is much scope for increase the number of women

beneficiaries. The scheme may allocate a budget for women farmers which is presently

not there.

• Nearly 25% funds are allocated exclusively for SC/ST beneficiaries. There is nearly 100%

utilisation of funds under TSP and SCSP component. Within the scheme, there are higher

subsidy percentage for SC/ST beneficiaries.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Between 2014 to 2017 , about 17.1% beneficiaries were from SC category, 8.3% were

from ST and 7.6% were from OBCs. About 65.3% of the total CHCs are run by

entrepreneurs who belong to SC/ST and OBC category, which indicate a significant

participation of marginal communities and is a positive indicator on progress of project.

• Moreover, the analysis of respondents’ data reveals that the majority of demonstrations

were held in the fields of OBC (53.9%), SC (23.1%) and ST (5.1%) farmers. This indicates

that the process of on field demonstration has been more inclusive encompassing all

categories of farmers. More field demonstrations should be conducted, especially in the

tribal/ aspirational districts to increase tribal participation.

Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas

i. Accountability and Transparency

SMAM envisages a central management information system for monitoring and progress of

mission activities. This can be accessed at https://agrimachinery.nic.in/. In addition, a dedicated

website is developed wherein detailed information about the scheme, its updated guidelines,

information about the associated FMTTI/IAs, the equipment tested, No of CHCs and Farmers bank

supported under the scheme can be checked.

The details of machines and equipment tested and which are eligible for subsidy under the

scheme are also available on the website. The evaluation reports of older scheme as well as SMAM

are also available on the website. The subsidy transfer to beneficiary is DBT based. The subsidy is

transferred either to the dealer or beneficiaries account. This transfer is linked with DBT portal.

Aadhar is mandatory for transfer of subsidy under the scheme. Detailed information on registered

dealers, farmers, CHCs, FPO/SHG supported under the scheme and various progress reports can

be accessed from DBT portal.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

In addition, farmers’ guide on agriculture machinery has been customised and developed for

different states according to the agro-climatic zones, soil type and cropping pattern. The

guidelines are available in English as well as regional languages i.e. Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Oriya,

Gujarati, Tamil, Malayalam and Marathi.

In addition, links to farm machinery training and testing institutes are also provided. Within each

institute website, one can access the progress reports on machines that have been tested, testing

charges, achievements, list of approved equipment, RTI replies and other relevant information

related to the scheme.

Independent evaluation studies of erstwhile schemes and the current SMAM schemes are also

available on the website. Updated information on physical progress under the scheme is available

on the agricmachinery.com (Details provided in later section).

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The project appraisal and approval are governed by the latest citizen charter 2019-20 which is

available on department’s website. This is applicable to all schemes. In addition, grievances if any,

can be raised on CPGRAMS portal.

To prevent leakages a robust monitoring mechanism has been adopted as mentioned earlier. In

addition, teams constituted by ministry and state nodal agencies visit states and project sites to

track project progress. Aadhar linked beneficiary transfer and continuous social audits through

PRI institutions also help in building transparency.

The income increase among the scheme beneficiaries has been analysed from the HH Survey.

There has been 117% increase in income.

ii. Gender mainstreaming

There is significant focus on encouraging mechanisation among farmers with special focus on

women to reduce their drudgery. Within the scheme, for women beneficiary, 60% assistance on

cost of unit is provided for component 2. In component 3 assistance in form of 50% of the

equipment cost is provided to women beneficiary. In addition there are specific trainings on

gender friendly equipment are also being provided. The latest data on women beneficiary is not

available. As per the concurrent impact evaluation report by WAPCOS in 2018, nearly 29.2% of

the beneficiary who have availed training at FMTTIs between 2014-17 are women. The data on

women benefits availed by women farmers is not being maintained by all states during the

scheme evaluation. Only 7 states provided information on funds utilised for women farmers and

it was observed that 10.2% of total funds utilised under the scheme were for women farmers.

It was also highlighted during the KIIs that the

majority of custom hiring centres established

under the scheme in Kerala have large

participation of women. Considering the fact

that among all states more than 1/4th of the

total CHCs have been established in Kerala this

indicates towards a positive indication in

involvement of women in scheme

interventions in the state.

The share of male and female workers among

scheme beneficiary households has been

iii. Direct/Indirect employment

SMAM is focused on increasing farm power and postharvest processing through promoting

mechanisation. The promotion, demonstration and purchase of machinery helps in creating

network of dealers and repairers and village level, while farmers machinery banks and CHCs helps

in promoting rural entrepreneurship as the CHC operators and machinery bank operators are

usually individual entrepreneurs A summary of achievements is given below:

5 No of High Tech Hubs established 225  
6 No of Farmer machinery banks established at village level 7041

Source : Progress data shared by department

The data on direct and indirect employment generated by the scheme is not maintained by the

Department. However, considering the large reach of the scheme along with reasonable physical

implementation, generated employment in line with the physical progress may have been created.

iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient

practices & diversifications

SMAM is promoting mechanisation of agriculture/horticulture by strengthening farm power and

post-harvest technologies. Under PHT component support is provided for purchase of machinery

for crop residue management. However, during implementation there is limited focus on crop

residue management and more stress is there on increasing farm power. Increasing farm power

by promoting machinery that consumes energy make agriculture more resource intensive. Within

the scheme there is need to encourage precision mechanization that can help in better utilisation

of resources i.e soil and water.

Demonstration on crop residue management are also being taken up that can help in reducing

pollution from burning of crop waste and straw. Apart from this, there are no trainings related to

disaster risk or climate change.

The evaluation report by WAPCOS on SMAM highlights the overall positive impact of

mechanisation as it helped in reducing inputs with 11% reduction in seed rate, 26.6% reduction

in weed instances, 22.4% reduction in diesel consumption and 12.7% reduction in fertiliser

requirements.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the

scheme in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

Nearly 25% funds are allocated exclusively for SC/ST population. There is nearly 100% utilisation

of funds under TSP and SCSP component. SC/ST beneficiaries are eligible for upto 50% subsidy

for purchase of equipment under component-3, whereas the other beneficiaries are eligible for

40% subsidy. For purchase of PHT equipment for food grains, horticulture and oilseeds SC/ST

beneficiaries can get 60% subsidy whereas the general beneficiaries can get 50% subsidy. Under

component-2, the SC/ST beneficiaries can get 60% of cost of unit subsidized whereas the general

beneficiaries can get 50% subsidy.

Between 2014-2017, about 17.1% beneficiaries were from SC category, 8.3% were from ST and

7.6% were from OBCs. Of the total beneficiaries, more than 70% have not used any implement

before. About 65.3% of the total CHCs are run by entrepreneurs who belong to SC/ST and OBC

category, which indicate a significant participation of marginal communities and is a positive

indicator on progress of project. In addition, the analysis of respondents’ data reveals that the

majority of demonstrations were held in the fields of OBC (53.9%), SC (23.1%) and ST (5.1%)

farmers. This indicates that the process of on field demonstration has been more inclusive

encompassing all categories of farmers.

vii. Development, dissemination & adoption of innovative practices, technology & know-

how

SMAM focus mainly on increasing mechanisation through demonstrations, trainings and

dissemination of information. The progress of SMAM on field demonstrations, trainings and

dissemination is given below.

In addition, farmers’ guide on agriculture machinery has been customised and developed for

different states according to the agro-climatic zones, soil type and cropping pattern. The

guidelines are available in English as well as regional languages i.e. Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Oriya,

Gujarati, Tamil, Malayalam and Marathi. The information on farmers’ guide includes suggested

machinery and different type of equipment suitable for different crops grown in the state. It also

contains information about the scheme. The FMTTIs and other institutes regularly tests

machinery and equipment. There is significant focus on quality of machinery. For dissemination

of information at district and block level assistance of KVKs and NGOs is also sought. Sometimes

KVKs are also involved in preparation of district level annual plans.

**_viii. Unlocking Synergies with other Government Programmes_**

The scheme in its design focuses on convergence of multiple schemes. The equipment tested and

approved under the scheme can act as ready reference for other schemes that are providing

subsidized machinery. Various groups, state level SHGs and FPOs formed under other scheme can

also apply for machinery under the scheme. For instance in Andhra Pradesh, the Rythu mitra

groups have been applying and purchasing machinery and are acting as Custom hiring centres in

many areas of the state.

ix. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives (e.g.

Farmer cooperatives, FPOs, Water User Associations, etc.) and civil society in the

scheme

More than 21 thousand FPOs and SHGs have been registered under the scheme. More than 60%

of the CHCs are owned by rural entrepreneurs and 17.2% are owned by SHG members, about

4.1% are owned by FPOs and about 16.4% belong to NGOs/ Cooperatives/ KVK or corporate

sector.^225 SMAM has been able to establish partnership with private stakeholders and collectives.

Custom hiring, centres or farm machinery banks established by a set of farmers is a better and

economically viable alternative for farm mechanisation as it reduces the financial burden on

individual and enable access to machinery for all members of the group.

Issues and Challenges

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  There is much variation in progress of different states in different activities. Moreover,  
    there are variations in progress in different activities covered under the scheme. Most of  
    the interventions are focused on increasing farm power, productivity and primary  
    processing. Very few proposals come up for crop residue management interventions.
2.  The scheme is primarily based on the assumption that increasing production and post-  
    harvest processing through mechanisation will aid in increasing farmers income. While  
    mechanisation does help in increasing production, lack of marketing and the difference in  
    consumer price and farm gate price received is the major deterrent in increasing farmer’s  
    income. In many cases farmers purchase expensive machines on loans but get stuck in  
    debt trap. This happens mainly because of two reasons - the production levels have not  
    increased as expected or the farmers are unable to get the desired price for their produce  
    in the market. Sometimes climatic conditions such as insufficient rainfall, instances of pest  
    and diseases also affect the production negatively.
3.  Selection of district on the basis of merely farm power availability can limit the scope of  
    the scheme as another objective of the scheme is development of post-harvest technology  
    and infrastructure. The status of post-harvest technology and their potential can also be  
    taken into account while selecting districts for promoting mechanisation.
4.  Within scheme more stress is there on increasing farm power. Increasing farm power by  
    promoting machinery that consumes energy makes agriculture more resource intensive.  
    This may also have negative environmental impacts.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  Delay in progress of activities and processing of funds is observed for components where  
    state’s contribution is required. Some states do not contribute the prescribed 40% and this  
    is observed even in case of hill states and NE states which are required to contribute 10%.  
    In such cases, the funds are reallocated to better performing states which leads to skewed  
    progress.

o The information on progress of CHCs, Farm banks, beneficiaries, etc. is to be provided

by state governments to the Department. While some states submit progress timely,

others do not.

1.  Delay is sometimes observed in DLEC meetings and preparation of district level plan due to  
    busy schedules of the members; this often causes delay in proposal submission at state  
    level.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

C. Capacity building

1.  Many state departments suffer from lack of qualified human resources, with experience in  
    mechanisation such as qualified agriculture engineers. This, many times, leads to low  
    quality proposals which may not be according to the needs of the state.
2.  There is a requirement for more field demonstration activities and melas to encourage  
    adoption among farmers^226.
3.  About 99% of the trainees trained at FMTTI have indicated their satisfaction with training  
    imparted but most of the trainees under FMTTIs are from nearby region. There is a need  
    for covering people from distant places for more comprehensive coverage of  
    beneficiaries^227.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  There is limited inclusion of small and marginal farmers in CHCs and farmers’ bank.
2.  During field survey, it was observed that there is a general perception among farmers that  
    the machinery provided by states under various schemes at subsidized rates is highly  
    priced although cheaper and better options are available in market at lesser price.

On the basis of the discussion above, the issues and challenges have been presented below:

(^226) Evaluation report WAPCOS  
(^227) Evaluation report WAPCOS  
**Primary Reasons highlighted for Delay in Activities**  
• The primary reason highlighted for slow progress of scheme interventions is  
due to the delay in receipt of state contribution.  
• Delay in DLEC meetings leading to delay in proposal submission at state level.  
• Few states do not provide information on progress of activities on time, which  
affects scheme performance  
• It has been highlighted that the components which received 100% central  
assistance under the scheme has shown better performance as opposed to  
those which required state share  
• It has been observed that some states do not contribute the required 40%  
and even 10%, in such cases, the funds are reallocated to better performing  
states. Some states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar  
are not updating progress regularly, which affect scheme performance and  
overall utilisation of funds.

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the recommendations for the scheme:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  There is much variation in progress of different states in different activities under the  
    scheme. Therefore, there is a need for more distributed performance across states and  
    accordingly more intense engagement with the lagging states should be taken up. Also,  
    there are variations in progress in different activities covered under the scheme. Most of  
    the interventions are focused on increasing farm power and primary processing units. Very  
    few proposals come up for crop residue management interventions. Considering this,  
    proposals on crop residue management and effective utilisation of biomass can be  
    encouraged, priority can be given to states where instances of heavy pollution due to  
    residue burning in winter are very high.
2.  A major objective of the scheme is to increase the reach of farm mechanization to small and  
    marginal farmers and to the regions where availability of farm power is low. As mentioned  
    earlier, more than 60% of the CHCs are owned by rural entrepreneurs and 17.2% are owned  
    by SHG members, about 4.1% are owned by FPOs and about 16.4% belong to NGOs/  
    Cooperatives/ KVK or corporate sector. It may be more relevant to focus on FPOs/ FPCs/  
    SHG members to increase their participation in the scheme. Involvement of farmers’  
    groups/ SHGs would ensure higher participation of farmers (through their members) and  
    larger access to farm mechanization for farmers.
3.  The status of post-harvest technology and their potential can also be taken into account  
    along with farm power availability for selection of districts for promoting mechanisation.  
    This would ensure that the scheme is also aligned to its other objective of development of  
    post-harvest technology and infrastructure.
4.  As mentioned earlier, in the scheme more focus is on increasing farm power. Increasing  
    farm power by promoting machinery that consumes energy make agriculture more  
    resource intensive. Hence, there is need to encourage precision mechanization that can help  
    in better utilisation of resources.
5.  There is focus on encouraging mechanisation among farmers with special focus on women  
    to reduce their drudgery. Within the scheme, there are higher subsidy percentage for  
    women beneficiaries. However, the latest data on women beneficiary under the scheme is  
    not available. The data on benefits availed by women farmers is not being maintained by all  
    states during the scheme evaluation. Only 7 states provided information on funds utilised  
    for women farmers and it was observed that 10.2% of total funds utilised under the scheme  
    were for women farmers. Hence, there is much scope for increase the number of women  
    beneficiaries. The scheme may allocate a budget for women farmers which is presently not  
    there.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  As mentioned, delay in progress of activities and processing of funds is observed for  
    components where state’s contribution is required. More intensive engagement with the  
    lagging states may be taken up for expediting the implementation of the scheme across all  
    states.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  Timelines can be assigned for submission of proposal and DLEC meetings, a fix day and time  
    can be set for DLEC meetings in every fortnight during proposal submission, thereafter  
    monthly or bi-monthly meetings needs to be ensured
2.  The targets for the output indicators are available for 2018-19. In 2018-19, the scheme over  
    achieved the target for giving financial assistance for procurement of agricultural  
    machinery/ equipment whereas it could not achieve the other targets such as number of  
    CHC hubs established and number of Hi-Tech hubs established. CHCs or farm machinery  
    banks established by a set of farmers is a better and economically viable alternative for farm  
    mechanisation as it reduces the financial burden on individual and enable access to  
    machinery for all members of the group. Considering the potential of CHCs and Hi-Tech  
    hubs in increasing mechanization and generating employment, the targets for CHCs and Hi-  
    Tech hubs should be increased and more focus should be given to promote these activities.

_C. Capacity building_

1.  As mentioned, many state departments suffer from lack of qualified human resources,  
    with experience in mechanisation such as qualified agriculture engineers, which affects  
    the quality of the proposals. Therefore, the state departments may be encouraged to  
    recruit qualified technical experts and agricultural engineers.
2.  Demonstration activity is critical to encourage adoption of farm mechanization amongst  
    farmers. There is a requirement for more field demonstration activities and melas along  
    with increased budget for the same.^228
3.  As mentioned earlier, most of the trainees under FMTTIs are from nearby region.  
    Considering the effectiveness of the training in the FMTTIs, there is a need for including  
    people from distant places for more comprehensive coverage of beneficiaries. More  
    FMTTIs may be promoted in different parts of the country especially in the uncovered  
    areas^229.
4.  Low awareness about the training programmes and other benefits of the scheme is an  
    issue. There is a need for awareness generation about the scheme, particularly amongst  
    the rural youth through state governments and at the central level.
5.  Testing of equipment needs to become faster. Institutes such as IARI PUSA, RAU PUSA and  
    IIT Kharagpur, etc. need to perform better and speed up testing activities. The staff  
    requirement also needs to be fulfilled to improve the performance^230.
6.  Under the Post-Harvest Technologies (PHT) component, support is provided for purchase  
    of machinery for crop residue management. However, during implementation there is  
    limited focus on crop residue management and more stress is on increasing farm power.  
    Demonstrations on crop residue management are taken up that can help in reducing  
    pollution from burning of crop waste and straw. Apart from this, there are no trainings  
    related to disaster risk or climate change. Considering the impact of crop residue burning  
    on the environment, it is important that trainings of farmers regarding negative  
    environmental impacts of residue burning be taken and related disaster risks may be  
    taken up in large scale particularly in states such as Punjab, Haryana, UP, etc.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  More CHCs and farmer banks comprising of small and marginal farmers can be promoted,  
    awareness among the functionaries also needs to be developed regarding the same
2.  As can be seen that the SMAM has robust mechanism for testing and assistance is provided  
    for machines that are tested and approved under the scheme, the website also contains  
    information on machines and equipment as well as approved dealers. Awareness needs to  
    be built among the users regarding this, in addition other schemes that are distributing  
    equipment and machinery also need to follow the SMAM guidelines so that the farmers get  
    access to quality machinery.
3.  Although the output and outcome indicators largely cover the intended objectives of the  
    scheme, the output indicators may also include an indicator on the number of renewable  
    energy based farm equipment procured and post-harvest units established. This would  
    indicate the extent of adoption of such environment friendly equipment, considering the  
    importance of renewable energy in terms of both environmental sustainability and farm  
    profitability. Similarly, the outcome indicators may also include an indicator on the total  
    area brought under renewable energy based mechanized agricultural practices.
4.  The outcome indicator wise targets and achievements were not available. Measurement of  
    progress of outcome indicators vis-à-vis targets are critical for measuring the impacts of  
    the scheme.
5.  The data on direct and indirect employment generated by the scheme is not captured and  
    maintained by the Department. The employment generation data (including employment  
    generated for SC/ ST and Women separately) may be captured to assess the overall impact  
    of the scheme in this regard.

E. Convergence

1.  Standalone mechanisation without effective marketing to ensure increased prices for the  
    farmers may not lead to increase in farmers’ income. Mechanisation efforts needs to be  
    supplemented by better marketing of produce. Hence, convergence with agri-marketing  
    schemes is critical for success of the farm mechanization.
2.  The equipment tested and certified under the scheme along with the established cost norms  
    can act as ready reference for other schemes that are providing subsidized machinery/  
    equipment. For example, schemes such as RKVY, MIDH, etc. may benefit due to adoption of  
    such certified standards and cost norms.
3.  There is a potential of convergences with other schemes such as MIDH, NFSM, RKVY, etc.  
    where farm mechanization component is also covered.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Key Inputs from Previous Evaluation of the Scheme:

The monitoring, concurrent evaluation and impact assessment of SMAM by WAPCOS

has provided component wise recommendations in its report. these include

• Most of the trainees in FMTTIs are from neighbouring areas, it should also cover

far-away areas

• Scale of testing needs to be improved and more FMTTIs can be established for

the same

• Recommendations on developing testing facilities and different centres

• Need for more funding for demonstration

• CHCs have been found to be effective and profitable, need to increase the

targets of CHCs and need to focus on developing both farm mechanisation and

value addition centres Developing custom hiring

• Need to focus on crop residue management, solar operated micro irrigation

applicators in moisture stressed areas

• Need to stop price negotiations after inviting tenders

• Compulsory training for farmers who have availed subsidy under the scheme

It also suggested series of policy measures. The scheme has put more emphasis

on CHCs and demonstrations. In addition the funding and infrastructure

requirement at training and testing institutes can be assessed and updated to

accelerate the pace of testing and demonstrations

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

This scheme is now sub-mission of the National Mission on Agricultural Extension and

Technology (NMAET). The Scheme guidelines of NMAET mention that the common

threads running across all 4 Sub-Missions are Extension & Technology. The scheme

aims to restructure & strengthen agricultural extension to enable delivery of appropriate

technology and improved agronomic practices to the farmers. This is envisaged to be

achieved by:

*   A mix of physical outreach & interactive methods of information  
    dissemination
*   Use of ICT
*   Popularization of modern and appropriate technologies
*   Capacity building and institution strengthening to promote mechanization
*   Availability of quality seeds, plant protection etc.
*   Encourage the aggregation of farmers into Interest Groups (FIGs) to form  
    Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)

The components of mechanization from other schemes such as MIDH and NFSM may

be merged with this sub-mission as these are similar components.

2.2.8 Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing

Background of the Scheme

India has transformed from being a net importer of food grains to one of the major exporters.

However, the farmers are not able to reap the benefits of this transformation due to slow progress

in marketing systems and inadequate availability of storage infrastructure. The Integrated

Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM) has been developed for providing farmers with access

to competitive markets and infrastructure. This will ultimately help in better price realisation for

the farmers. ISAM is an umbrella scheme of the Central Government to support the State

Governments in governing the agricultural produce marketing through creation and

improvement of market structures, capacity building and generating access to market

information. During 2017-18, National Agriculture Market Scheme popularly known as e-NAM

scheme has also been made part of the same.^231

**Objectives of the scheme**

• To promote creation of agricultural marketing infrastructure by providing backend

subsidy support to state, cooperative and private sector investments.

• To promote creation of scientific storage capacity and to promote pledge financing to

increase farmers’ income.

• To promote Integrated Value Chains (confined up to the stage of primary processing only)

to provide vertical integration of farmers with primary processors.

• To use ICT as a vehicle of extension to sensitize and orient farmers to respond to new

challenges in agricultural marketing.

• To establish a nation-wide information network system for speedy collection and

dissemination of market information and data on arrivals and prices for its efficient and

timely utilization by farmers and other stake holders.

• To support framing of grade standards and quality certification of agricultural

commodities to help farmers get better and remunerative prices for their graded produce.

• To catalyze private investment in setting up of agribusiness projects and thereby provide

assured market to producers and strengthen backward linkages of agribusiness projects

with producers and their groups.

• To undertake and promote training, research, education, extension and consultancy in the

agri marketing sector.

**Components (Sub-schemes)**

• Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI)

• Marketing research and information network (MRIN)

• Strengthening of Agmark Grading facilities (SAGF)

• Training, Research and Consultancy through Choudhary Charan Singh Institute of

Agriculture Marketing (NIAM)

• National Agriculture Market (e-NAM)

**Implementation structures and stakeholders**

The sub schemes under ISAM namely Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI), Marketing

Research and Information Network (MRIN) and Strengthening of Agmark Grading Facilities

(SAGF) is implemented by the Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI), an attached office of

Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and farmers welfare. Small Farmers Agri-business

Consortium (SFAC), an autonomous organization, implements the sub scheme of e-NAM and Agri-

Business Development (ABD). Choudhary Charan Singh National Institute of Agricultural

Marketing (NIAM), also an autonomous organization under DAC&FW, provides training, research

and consultancy in agri-marketing sector.

AMI scheme aims to develop (i) Storage Infrastructure and (ii) Marketing Infrastructure other

than storage. AMI sub scheme is a back ended capital subsidy scheme and subsidy provided on

capital cost of the project to develop agricultural marketing infrastructure and storage

infrastructures. The infrastructure development includes Infrastructure for

development/upgradation to Rural Haats as Gramin Agricultural Market (GrAMs), Common

Facilitation Centre for FPOs, marketing infrastructures in market yards, Infrastructure for direct

marketing, Mobile infrastructure for postharvest operations including reefer vans, Stand-alone

cold storages up to 1000 MTs, Integrated Value Chain (IVC) Projects up to primary processing

stage etc. The scheme is also reform linked for non-storage infrastructure projects of State/UT

agencies. The following reforms fall under the purview of this scheme namely (i) direct marketing;

(ii) contract Farming; (iii) setting up of wholesale market for agricultural and allied produce in

private and cooperative sector, (iv) e-trading; (v) unified single trading license valid across the

State/UT and (vi) single point levy of market fee across the State/UT. Eligible beneficiaries under

AMI scheme can be Individuals, Group of farmers / growers, FPOs/FPCs registered under

respective companies Act/cooperatives Partnership/ Proprietary firms, Companies,

Corporations; Non-Government Organization (NGO), Self Help Group (SHG); Cooperatives,

Cooperative Marketing Federation; Societies Act/ Societies Registration Act etc.

Strengthening of Agmark Grading Facilities (SAGF) is being implemented by DMI to certify

agricultural produce under AGMARK if they conform to grade standards under Agricultural

Produce (Grading Marking) Act, 1937, General Grading and Marking Rules, 1988 (as amended up

to 2009) and specific commodity Rules notified by DMI, DAC&FW and the Ministry of Agriculture.

The mandatory AGMARK certification is prescribed compulsory for 8 food categories namely:

blended edible vegetable oil, fat spread, honey dew, Carbia Callosa, Kangra tea, til oil (sesame oil)

obtained from white sesame seeds grown in Tripura, Assam and West Bengal, ghee having less

Reichert value than that specified for the area where such ghee is sold and light black pepper. For

export of agricultural products such as fruits and vegetables, Agmark Grading is also done.

Monitoring and implementation of this scheme component is implemented by 11 Regional Offices,

27 Sub Offices, 11 Regional Agmark Laboratory, a Central Agmark Laboratory through Quality

Control division at Head Office Faridabad.

The Central Sector Scheme Promotion of National Agriculture Market (NAM) through Agri-Tech

Infrastructure Fund (ATIF) was announced in July 2015 with a budget allocation of Rs. 200 crore.

The scheme has been created to increase the income of farmers with incidental benefit of

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

moderating price rise respectively through deployment of a common e-market platform (called

e-NAM) in 585 selected regulated wholesale agriculture markets by March, 2018 and is managed

centrally by a lead implementing agency i.e. Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC). The

virtual market e-NAM has physical markets at the back end and it ensures registration of farmers

/ sellers, lot details at the entry gate, weight and quality assaying, auctions / trade transactions,

payment by buyers to sellers and other agencies involved in the chain of transaction.

To implement e-NAM in the states, States/UTs need to undertake mandatory reforms in their

Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts to avail the following assistance:

− single trading license to be valid across the State

− single point levy of market fee across the State

− provision for e-auction / e-trading as a mode of price discovery to be facilitated by the

State Agriculture Marketing Department / Board / APMCs

Assistance is provided through e-NAM software, one time grant in up to Rs.30.00 lakh per market,

based on their DPR for purchase of hardware, internet connection, assaying equipment and

related infrastructure. SFAC also deputes one person at each market, for a period of one year to

provide day-to-day hand holding support to stakeholders for its successful implementation. The

beneficiaries of the e-NAM scheme are farmers, APMCs / RMCs (Mandi’s), Traders, Buyers,

Processors and Exporters.^232 Monitoring of the scheme is conducted by a combination of periodic

desk review, field visits and mechanism. Overall monitoring of the progress of the scheme is

undertaken by the Project Appraisal Committee of the respective States/UTs. At the National

level, monitoring and evaluation is led by lead implementing agency SFAC along with DMI/NIC

with the support of Strategic Partner.

**Intended contribution to sectoral performance**

India is an agricultural country and one third population depends on the agricultural sector

directly or indirectly. Agriculture remains as the main stray of the Indian economy and

commercialization of agricultural production has become one of central focal points of the

economy. Agricultural marketing comprises all operations involved in the movement of farm

produce from the producer to the ultimate consumer which includes operations like collecting,

grading, processing, preserving, transportation and financing. Under the various platforms of

marketing of agricultural products, some of the key ones include sale in village markets, sale in

mandis, sale in regulated markets and co-operative marketing.

The Integrated Scheme of Agriculture Marketing aims to bring in an efficient marketing system to

reduce middlemen, facilitate storage areas, improve bargaining capacities and increase the

number of regulated markets. The scheme has contributed significantly towards improving the

agricultural marketing system by establishing regulated markets, co-operative marketing

societies, warehousing and market yards, and by providing a platform to ensure real-time

marketing information to sellers and farmers.

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

The scheme concurs with the National Agenda of Doubling Farmers Income as it seeks to facilitate

agricultural marketing removing all inefficiencies of the market by 2020. The scheme also seeks

to Double Farmers’ Income through improving the remuneration of farmers by fetching a better

price and removing all intermediaries.

The scheme aligns with the UN SDGs as well. The scheme focusses on SDG 2, 8, 9 and 12 viz.,

increase investment on marketing infrastructure and quality procurement.

The scheme is aligned with the National Development Agenda by encouraging participation of the

private sector in agricultural development, promote emergence of ‘agripreneurs’ so that even

small and marginal farmers can capture a higher share of value addition from ‘farm-gate to fork’.

ISAM has been aligned towards the SDGs and also the National Development Agenda, as depicted

in the following table.

agents and 122171 traders/buyers have been registered on e-NAM portal. Trading of 24288397

ton agri-commodities having trade value of Rs. 64923 crore have been recorded on e-NAM

portal.^239

The data on outputs and outcome indicators is not available for the scheme.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• ISAM is intended to support the State Governments in governing the agricultural produce

marketing through creation and improvement of market structure, capacity building and

generating access to market information. Thus, the scheme is highly relevant for boosting

the overall trade of agri-commodities in the country by providing the stakeholder access

to competitive markets and ultimately help in better price realization, particularly for

farmers.

• The scheme has contributed significantly towards improving the agricultural marketing

system by establishing regulated markets, co-operative marketing societies, warehousing

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

and market yards, and by providing a platform to ensure real-time marketing information

to sellers and farmers.

• The scheme also seeks to Double Farmers’ Income through improving the remuneration

of farmers by fetching a better price and removing all intermediaries.

• The scheme is aligned with the National Development Agenda by encouraging

participation of the private sector in agricultural development, promote emergence of

‘agripreneurs’ so that even small and marginal farmers can capture a higher share of value

addition from ‘farm-gate to fork’.

**Effectiveness**

• Majority of the markets, particularly, those in remote areas are poor in terms of

availability of facilities for banking, internet connectivity, storage and drying structure.

Moreover, the markets are still insufficient in number with the all-India average area of

regulated market being 487.40 sq km against a recommended market area of about 80 sq.

km. There is also huge variation in the density of regulated markets in different parts of

the country, which varies from 118.78 sq km. in Punjab to 11215 sq. km. in Meghalaya.

• Although an Agmarknet portal has been established which connects more than 3355

markets, price related information is available for more than 300 commodities on daily

basis. However, in order to improve its content and outreach, special market information

and intelligence cell may be set-up or existing departments may be strengthened within

the state agriculture marketing boards.

• Under the ambitious e-NAM project, 585 whole sale regulated markets (APMCs) of 16

States and 2 UTs have been integrated with e-NAM portal by 31st March, 2018.

• Data on outputs and outcome indicators is not available for the scheme which needs to be

monitored on a periodic basis for assessing effectiveness of the scheme.

• Regular training and capacity building of market functionaries and implementing agency

staff should also be carried out. Although the training needs will come from training needs

assessment, an indicative list of trainings may include planning and implementation for

market improvement, preparation and implementation of operations and maintenance

plans for the market, post-harvest management; marketing and market extension,

maintenance of records and accounts, and market charge estimation and collection.

**Efficiency**

• The budgeted estimates for the agri-marketing schemes have shown a fluctuating trend

and has declined since FY 2017-18.

• Lack of adequate infrastructure and skilled manpower are key barriers to efficient quality

assaying. Currently, mandis have limited capacity and can only handle Quality Assaying of

6% - 15% of total arrivals during the peak season. Moreover, the traders do not trust the

quality tests conducted by the mandi officials. Also the turnaround time for quality test in

the lab is reportedly much greater than the currently practices traditional process.

• A recent study of the implementation of e-NAM scheme in three states namely Uttar

Pradesh, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh has found that less than 1% of trading reportedly

takes place on the e-NAM platform.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• The capacity building component of the scheme should particularly focus on improving

the farmer capacity to comply with market quality standards to improve their market

access (including for exports).

• Futures markets can be an important risk management tool for farmers in times of

increased price volatility. In this area in particular, awareness-raising and training

measures in the farming community and farmers ́ organisations should be prioritised.

**Sustainability**

• Besides setting up of new infrastructure, the scheme implementation should also lay more

emphasis on modernization of the existing market by the development of basic

infrastructure that promotes improved handling of commodities, improved hygiene,

improved price dissemination, development of negotiable warehouse receipts etc.

• Apart from strengthening storage infrastructure integrated approach needs to be

followed for all crops, focus should be on grading, value addition, direct marketing

through better logistic facilities and transparent mechanism for price determination.

• Range of activities that can be supported under the schemes needs to be expanded and

states should be sensitized to promote the same.

• Convergence with other scheme/ programme/initiatives of center and state government,

developmental organizations and private sector should be encouraged for creating

backward and forward linkage and development of an integrated value chain.

**Impact**

• The overall achievements have been limited to selected states/ regions which limits the

impact of the scheme for development of the sector. Therefore, it is suggested to engage

actively with other states/ regions which are lagging in implementation of scheme's

activities

• E-NAM can play a significant role in building transparent markets & pricing systems.

Thereby, help the farmer to negotiate the contracts better and also improve access to

finance by enabling more robust business planning and thus better appreciation of market

risks by lender.

**Equity**

• Under Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) component, women are eligible for

subsidy @ 33.33% as against 25% for others.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas**

i. Accountability and Transparency

The sub scheme on AMI is being implemented by the Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI),

an attached office of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare. The sub

scheme is implemented as back-ended capital subsidy for investment in eligible storage,

marketing infrastructure projects. The financial assistance can be availed for eligible projects

which are financed by the following financial institutions: Commercial, Cooperative, Regional

Rural Banks, Agricultural Development Finance Companies (ADFCs), State Cooperative Banks

(SCBs), State Cooperative Agricultural and Rural Development Banks (SCARDBs), Scheduled

Urban Cooperative Banks, Scheduled Primary Cooperative Banks (PCBs), North Eastern

Development Financial Corporation (NEDFi), other institutions eligible for refinance by National

Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) or any other financial institution such as

State Financial Corporations (SFCs) approved by DAC&FW. State agencies can finance their

projects with own funds as well. The subsidy offered to be channelized through NABARD for

projects financed by above mentioned financial institutions. Subsidy for sanctioned projects are

released post a joint inspection by FI, NABARD (or its representative) and DMI to ensure that the

executed project conforms to technical and financial parameters. To ensure accountability and

transparency in implementation of the project, the Panchayati Raj Institutes (PRIs) are engaged

to confirm the infrastructure created / proposed is used for the purpose for which it is designed.

The PRIs are informed by Block / Gram Panchayats. In areas where part IX of the constitution

does not apply, this information is shared with equivalent rural local bodies.

In case of agricultural marketing infrastructure projects including storage infrastructure projects

of cooperative institutions, processed by NCDC, the subsidy is routed through NCDC.

Monitoring of projects being implemented is conducted by FI, NABARD, NCDC and by DMI through

its Regional/ Sub offices. The monitoring schedule of the project has been depicted below:

Annual Review Annually

Citizen charter covering the objectives of the ISAM scheme is prepared for the nodal institution,

Directorate of Marketing and Inspection. The mandate of the institution and its service standards

has been laid down. The accomplishment of its mission for development of required marketing

infrastructure by encouraging active participation of individual/ Institutions/ Entrepreneurs/

Government Agencies under various schemes, coverage of markets under computer connectivity

for dissemination of market information along with several other objectives have been clearly

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

detailed. The accountability of Regional office, Sub-Office, Central Agmark Laboratory and

Regional Agmark Laboratories set to carry out service standards of the various schemes has been

also mentioned in the charter. The grievance redressal mechanism is also drafted with

information on Public Grievance Officers listed region-wise. The timeframe of 3 months is fixated

for final redressal of grievances.

The Market Research and Information Network (MRIN) component in ISAM is implemented by

DMI along with support from National Informatics Centre (NIC), State Governments through State

Agriculture Marketing Boards (SAMBs). The data collection and dissemination of markets across

the country is done through the web portal of AGMARKNET. Financial assistance for supply of

computers, mobile handsets and required software is given to State Agricultural Marketing

Boards/Directorates/ Departments. The monthly progress under MRIN component is monitored

by the implementing agencies of the states (State Agricultural Marketing Boards/Directorates/

Departments) by constituting a State Level Committee of officers comprising DMI, NIC and State

Nodal Agency and send the progress/ minutes of the meeting to DMI.

Strengthening of Agmark Grading Facilities (SAGF) scheme component is implemented by the

Eleven Regional Agmark Laboratories (RALs) and Central Agmark Laboratory at Nagpur with DMI

being the nodal authority for certification of agricultural commodities including horticulture

commodities under AGMARK. The RALs procure required equipment, chemicals, glassware and

apparatus to conduct analysis of research samples and check samples for developing and

promoting grading & standardization.

The scheme component Agribusiness Development through Venture Capital Assistance and

Project Development Facility is focused on providing venture capital support to agribusiness

ventures, improve backward linkages of agri-business projects, and strengthen State and Central

SFAC (Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Consortium).

In addition, to increase transparency and faster subsidy transfer ENSURE portal developed by

NABARD is being used for processing of subsidy application. The subsidies granted under the

scheme are also transferred directly to the beneficiaries account.

ii. Gender Mainstreaming

Under Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) component, women are eligible for back

ended capital subsidy support of 33.33% as against 25% to help them access the competitive

markets with adequate infrastructure including cold chain logistics and thus fetch better price.

For women farmers, including SHGs mobilizing women, the subsidy ceiling of storage units up to

1000 MT is Rs. 1166.55; more than 1000 MT and up to 30000 MT is Rs. 1000.00, and maximum

ceiling of Rs 300.00 Lakhs is provisioned.

iii. Use of IT /Technology in driving efficiency

The ICT based Agricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET) is being managed

under the Market Research and Information Network component of ISAM. Aggregation and

dissemination of complete and accurate marketing information is the key objective of this

component. The AGMARKNET connects agricultural produce markets spread all over the country

along with the State Agriculture Marketing Boards and Directorates. The portal analyses

information drawn from 3356^240 markets across all States and UTs of the country. The weekly

arrivals and price trend analysis for important markets in respect of major agricultural

commodities transacted are under the purview of this scheme component through AGMARKNET.

This initiative has been able to reduce prices paid to intermediaries and bring benefits to a wide

cross section of farmers and consumers. Further enrichment of data collection and analysis is

constantly done in AGMARKNET to ensure better price realization and market access for the

farmers through educating farmers and also disseminating information through SMS/ Voice mail/

apps through mobile phones.

Other Market led Extension and Research services provided under MRIN component of ISAM

includes:

*   Publications of state level as well as market level information
*   Preparation of modules on accepted standards of grading, packaging and quality  
    certification, sanitary and phyto-sanitary aspects, good agricultural practices, success  
    stories in contract farming, group marketing, and responsibilities and rights in regulated  
    markets
*   Preparation of national level atlas (major areas of production, movement and storage and  
    of market and consuming centres), commodity profile
*   Preparation of training and educational modules in the areas of market driven production,  
    marketing finance, post-harvest management
*   Conducting farmer’s awareness programmes at market/ village level

Under e-NAM scheme, use of information technology is a key component to implement aspects

such as transparent online trading system, enablement of real-time price discovery and reduced

transaction cost of buyers, availability of information on e-NAM app, information dissemination

and online payment to farmers. National Informatics Centre (NIC) is the technical partner

responsible for:

*   Hosting e-NAM software on Meghraj cloud and provide support services to ensure  
    uninterrupted functioning
*   Providing and maintaining all the necessary infrastructure including virtual machines  
    (servers), base operating systems, firewall, load balancers, SMS and email services etc.
*   Providing technical advice to SFAC on Functional Requirement Specifications (FRS)  
    Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), Process Design Document (PDD)

The e-NAM virtual platform is also supported by the Strategic Partner who is responsible for the

design, testing, implementation, maintenance and management of all the set of applications and

modules. The online activities pertaining to the e-NAM platform that is covered by the Strategic

Partner are:

*   Masters & administration
*   Gate entry-exit management
*   Lot management
*   Quality assaying management
*   Bid management and e-tender / e-auction portal
*   Weight integration

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

*   Sale agreement and sale invoice
*   Payment gateway integration
*   email / SMS integration
*   Reports and MIS

iv. Reforms and Regulations

The Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM) has been pursuing comprehensive

reform agenda including closely working with the States to reform their APMC Acts & promote

contract farming. Certain states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Madhya

Pradesh, have not only amended their marketing laws and put in place conducive atmosphere but

have also made reform linked noticeable progress.^241 Under this scheme, development and

upgradation of 585 Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Markets along with 22,000

Gramin Haats to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) has been planned in the Union Budget

Announcement, 2018- 19242. The APMC Act has been further reformed to form a holistic

comprehensive and farmers’ friendly version by releasing the Model Act “The State/ UT

Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017”. This Act

intends to provide complete freedom to the cultivators and livestock rearers to sell their produce,

livestock and its product to the buyers and through the marketing channel of their choice offering

the better bid. The Model Act, inter-alia, provides for declaration of whole State as one unified

market, warehouses/silos/ cold storages as market sub-yards, rationalization of market fee and

commission charges. Arunachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have adopted the model

APLM Act, 2017 while Punjab has adopted partially^243. Other States are at varied stages in the

process of adoption. The model Act not only provides the facilitative legal eco-system for contract

farming but also for services all along the agri food value chain starting from pre-harvest, harvest

and post-harvest including marketing. In addition to the new Act, de-regulation of marketing of

Fruits & Vegetables has been brought in to address the issue of long intermediation in supply

chain of the highly perishable crops. Till now, 17 States (Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,

Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Delhi, West Bengal, Odisha, Rajasthan,

Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Karnataka, Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya) have

moved in this direction^244.

v. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives and civil

society in the scheme

With small and marginal farming comprising more than 86% of land holdings, which had been

echoed in the 28th report of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, the objective of increasing

farm income can be realized by attaining economies of scale. Collectivization of farmers through

formation of farmer groups is one of the key strategies adopted under this scheme component to

facilitate the post-harvest activities, value addition and marketing. Leveraging the formation and

facilitation of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) by various agencies like SFAC, NABARD, and

State Governments, this scheme component has built a pathway to create a robust infrastructure.

Apart from addition of non-storage facilities, AMI has created a provision to promote Common

Facilitation Centre for the FPOs//FPCs in order to connect farms with the markets. The facility

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

can include common facilities^245 and ancillary structures^246. While subsidy is offered up to 25% of

the total financial outlay of the project, the rate of subsidy has been increased to 33.33% for

Registered FPOs/ cooperatives/ SHGs for all projects. The assistance is provided to FPOs/FPCs^247

for creation of storage infrastructure (Capacity 50 - 5000 MTs) and Non- storage infrastructures.

The farmer producer organizations (FPOs-societies, cooperatives and companies), as well as

Village Producer Organizations (VPOs) can leverage the presence of GrAMs by using the platform

for selling their produce where they can gain enhanced bargaining power^248. They can also accrue

benefits by availing primary preparatory or preconditioning services, such as assaying, cooling,

packaging, and transporting from the GrAMs to APMC/RMC or any other primary or secondary or

terminal wholesale agricultural market. The associated market linkage provided by the

infrastructural arrangement created offers the following benefit for the small farmers aggregated

in the FPOs:

*   Reduced cost of first mile transportation by providing marketing platform closer to farm  
    gates
*   Provide a transparent system of aggregating the small lots thus substituting the informal  
    system of aggregation by the village traders.
*   Offering platform for purchase of agri-inputs as well as dissemination of new information  
    & knowledge relating to agriculture

vi. Unlocking Synergies with other Government Programmes

Funding system of storage infrastructure for development of GrAMs or primary rural markets is

mapped with funds allocated to AMI component under ISAM along with MIDH, RKVY-RAFTAR etc.

Supplementary support has also been brought in from Ministry of Food Processing Industries

(MoFPI) and Ministry of Textiles (MoT) to achieve the overall objective of the activities.

Issues and Challenges

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  Within the current set of activities there is limited focus on connecting farmers directly to  
    consumers.
2.  It was highlighted during KIIs and field survey that the present set of interventions focus  
    mainly on mandi or market level infrastructure, within this the present set of interventions  
    mainly focus on food grains and dry storage and related interventions. Limited focus is  
    there on horticulture and other interventions.
3.  The scheme has focused on development of rural haats as Gramin Agricultural markets and  
    bringing more mandi under e-NAM by supporting quality control and assaying labs and  
    mandi infrastructure. However, insufficient awareness among farmers and limited staff at  
    mandis still remains a cause of concern.
4.  The new operational guidelines focus on integrated value chain development most of the  
    interventions on ground focus on storage infrastructure development. The guidelines also  
    restrict integrated value chain activities to primary processing. The indicative list of  
    projects that are not supported under AMI is very broad and has exclusions such as projects  
    related to processing of fruits, vegetables, grains and pulses, it also prohibits silos. The  
    many exclusions in the guidelines leaves limited scope of activities that can be taken up  
    under the scheme. Moreover, the scheme does not support renovation of existing  
    infrastructure^249
5.  It has been observed during field surveys and KIIs that despite focusing on developing  
    mandi infrastructure, farmers in many parts of India and even in progressive states such as  
    AP are still not directly selling their produce in mandis. Some of the reasons highlighted  
    include slow processes in mandis, inadequate staff for monitoring and lack of transparency  
    in grading and processing of produce.
6.  There is variation across states in taxes and surcharges levied in mandis on  
    sale/procurement of produce. For instance in UP the taxes and surcharges are 2.5% while  
    in Delhi and Rajasthan it is less. This variation particularly in states where taxes are high  
    may lead to under-reporting of sales or reduced profits for farmers.

1.  Department is trying to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) based predictive software

    selection of appropriate crops, however little progress has been achieved in this regard due  
    to reservations and constraints highlighted by multiple users.
2.  Inadequate Marketing Infrastructure: The current marketing infrastructure is well below  
    the requirement of farmers to prevent post-harvest losses. As estimated by studies^250 ,  
    covered and open auction platforms exist only in two-thirds of the regulated markets, while  
    only one-fourth of the markets have common drying yards. Cold storage units exist in only  
    nine per cent of the markets and grading facilities in less than one-third of the markets.  
    Electronic weigh-bridges are available only in a few markets. The gaps in infrastructure are  
    also affecting the performance of e-NAM some observations in this regards are as under

o Under the e-NAM scheme, a transparent price discovery system can work well only if

proper infrastructure is available at the mandis during peak season. The assessment of

e-NAM scheme in the 3 states conducted in 2018 found there is inadequate

infrastructure quality assaying lab in the mandis. While several mandis have limited

space for accommodating equipment, some mandis have not procured all the

equipment needed for assaying.^251

o Under the e-NAM scheme, mandi officials are often found to lack the skills and expertise

required to conduct the quality tests. There are few skilled graders employed to

conduct the quality tests. This makes the stakeholders and traders, in particular,

question the quality and reliability of the quality test reports.^252

1.  Information Asymmetry: Inadequate information for obtaining current market prices in  
    different markets. Platforms like radio and television broadcasting and web portals like e-  
    NAM are being promoted to address the issue of information asymmetry between buyers  
    and sellers and promoting real time price discovery based on actual demand and supply.  
    However, the inclusion of all states is required with significant penetration and  
    homogenous usage of the application by the small and marginal farmers to fetch the best  
    price of the produce.
2.  A recent study of the implementation of e-NAM scheme^253 in three states namely Uttar  
    Pradesh, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh has found that less than 1% of trading reportedly  
    takes place on the e-NAM platform. There is a lack of awareness of the e-NAM scheme  
    among traders and farmers around its benefits, and the value it offers to them. Farmers also  
    perceive its registration process to be complex due to the documentation requirements  
    which increases the turnaround-time. The e-NAM software does not have a unique  
    identifier even for pre-registered farmers. This replicates the documentation work for  
    every farmers revisiting the mandi leading to delays.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  In the e-NAM scheme, traders and buyers have a lack of trust in the online system since they  
    often observe mismatch between traditional and automated processes. During the e-  
    auction process as well, unavailability of key information and longer time of  
    implementation leads to distrust and inconvenience among the traders. Traders also do not  
    know who to rely on the logistics and transportation of their purchase when trading across  
    mandis.^254

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  The scheme budget has been reducing every year, which is affecting its performance.

C. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  Although an Agmarknet portal has been established which connects more than 3355  
    markets, price related information is available for more than 300 commodities on daily  
    basis. There is significant scope of improvement in its content and outreach.
2.  The scheme's performance has been good, however, the overall achievements have been  
    limited to select states/ regions which limits the impact of the scheme for development of  
    the sector.
3.  e-NAM can play a significant role in building transparent markets & pricing systems.  
    Thereby, help the farmer to negotiate the contracts better and also improve access to  
    finance by enabling more robust business planning and thus better appreciation of market  
    risks by lender.
4.  The IT infrastructure being used in the e-NAM scheme are perceived to be underdeveloped  
    and leads to lack of trust in its efficiency among the users (traders and buyers). Digital  
    payment has become a barrier to repayment of informal loans that are inconvenient to  
    farmers. Frequent software glitches in the online payments discourage farmers from doing  
    online payment and prefer cash payment instead. Online payment are expected to take  
    (T+1) day approximately, however, sometimes it can take up to 15 days to reflect in  
    farmers’ accounts.^255

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the key recommendations for the scheme.

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  This can be addressed by devoting increased focus on development and support of FPOs  
    as part of the future interventions.
2.  The scheme is intended to support the State Governments in governing the agricultural  
    produce marketing through creation and improvement of market structure, capacity  
    building and generating access to market information. To achieve scheme objectives other  
    interventions such as small farm level infrastructure and strengthening of logistic  
    facilities needs to be promoted to ensure direct connect between farmer and consumer.  
    The will help in boosting the overall trade of agri-commodities in the country by providing  
    the stakeholder access to competitive markets and ultimately help in better price  
    realization, particularly for farmers.
3.  Awareness about scheme interventions and importance of market linkages through e-  
    NAM needs to be created among farmers and other stakeholders. Problem of staff needs  
    to be addressed immediately to ensure smooth operations of mandi.
4.  The scheme guidelines should be revised and made flexible, the guidelines should not be  
    too prescriptive and should be flexible enough to suit the local needs. The scheme should  
    also support renovation of infrastructure, this will particularly help old mandi and rural  
    haats as well as upgrading old warehouses and cold storages
5.  Efforts should be made to encourage more farmers to sell their produce in mandi  
    premises, the processes at mandi level can be made fast, efficient and transparent to  
    encourage farmers. Good performing mandis from states can be identified and felicitated,  
    staff from low performing mandis can be made to visit these mandis for training and  
    exposures. Low performing mandis of important production clusters should first be  
    targeted for development.
6.  The mandi taxes across states needs to be made uniform, there is need for a uniform law  
    across India for transaction of agricultural commodities
7.  The constraints highlighted by all stakeholders needs to be addressed in developing the  
    system, moreover, impact on prices of commodities in case of surplus production should  
    also be considered. Some pilots can be launched in selected areas to check the feasibility  
    and utility of the system. The AI system needs to be developed only after taking all  
    suggestions and constraints in mind. The impact of system on price of suggested  
    commodities can be ascertained by carrying out pilots in some districts
8.  Infrastructure gap assessment can be carried out in state markets, market committees  
    reporting high volume of trade can be prioritized for support. Mandi infrastructure also  
    need to be adequately established/ upgraded, such as proper entry gates, adequate  
    number of live work stations, weighing bridges connected to eNAM and trained resources  
    at gates so that the long queuing, particularly, during the peak season may be avoided.  
    Unique identifier number should be assigned to the pre-registered framers so that the  
    farmers only need to verify the details when they revisit the mandi to sell the produce.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

o In addition focus should be given on quality assaying as lack of adequate

infrastructure and skilled manpower are key barriers to efficient quality assaying.

Currently, mandis have limited capacity and can only handle Quality Assaying of 6% -

15% of total arrivals during the peak season.

o Moreover, the traders do not trust the quality tests conducted by the mandi officials.

Also the turnaround time for quality test in the lab is reportedly much greater than

the currently practices traditional process. Automation of quality assaying labs can

help reduce the process time , help save significantly on resources and will increase

transparency. This will help bring greater value to the process and build trust among

the stakeholders. However, setting up an automated lab may require huge investment.

Private sector participation may be encouraged for setting up of such labs. Fiscal

incentives in form of subsidy, tax rebates, rental discount, space availability etc may

be provided under the scheme to encourage the private player.

1.  Effort should be there to bring more mandis on board, the farmers registered on mkisan  
    app can also be provided information on rates of important commodities on their phone.  
    This component can be handled centrally, in addition market committees can be provided  
    support to install electronic display board on their premises.
2.  A recent study of the implementation of e-NAM scheme in three states namely Uttar  
    Pradesh, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh has found that less than 1% of trading reportedly  
    takes place on the e-NAM platform. Farmers have little awareness of the eNAM scheme,  
    its benefits, and the value it offers to them. This leads to a lack of interest in the scheme  
    and discourages farmers to participate in trading through eNAM. Rigorous advocacy and  
    promotion of the scheme should be undertaken involving all stakeholder for awareness  
    building about the scheme. Mandi officials should be encouraged to promote eNAM among  
    the stakeholders
3.  Trust on e-NAM can only be generated through awareness building and business process  
    re-engineering of the processes can be carried out to improve its performance and utility.  
    In addition logistic support can also be provided to farmers of traders through e-NAM for  
    better facilitation.
4.  The lack of quality testing, grading and assaying labs in markets for quality testing of  
    produce impacts price determination. Post-harvest infrastructure for collection and  
    storage of produce such a pack-houses, cold chain infrastructure, pre-cooling facilities  
    remains a concern. These infrastructure are important in increasing shelf-life of produce.  
    The current infrastructure also remains unutilised due to unorganised and fragmented  
    units of pre-cooling, cold-storage and transportation. There is limited village level  
    infrastructure for aggregation, storage and transportation of produce. Few other  
    challenges related to Agriculture marketing and infrastructure in doubling farmer’s  
    income report are:

o Poor availability of bank credit for infrastructure creation

o Delay in permits for change of land use for developing agri-infrastructure

o Lack of clusters of operation, existing production clusters needs to be facilitated with

appropriate logistics and marketing facilities.

o More focus on local value chain instead of interstate value chain

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

o Tendency to create infrastructure with only purpose of deferring sale and focus only

on storage negatively affects other post production activity that can enable access to

wider markets

Appropriate steps need to be taken up to address these issues in scheme design and

implementation.

1.  Private sector participation in agriculture marketing should be supported by the state by  
    encouraging them to engage in contract farming models, allowing direct marketing,  
    rationalization of market fee, and attracting agencies to take up development of market  
    infrastructure. There is limited incentive for the private sector to enter/ get involved in  
    marketing interventions scalable level which needs to be encouraged
2.  Automation of business transactions should be priorities/ given preference under the  
    scheme to improve transparency in the marketing systems
3.  Climate change is one of the most critical global governance issues and presents  
    adaptation and mitigation challenges for agriculture. Changes in temperature and  
    precipitation regimes that shift regional climate zones can also influence the viability of  
    agricultural market systems. Understanding the influence of climate change on the  
    different sub-sectors and functions of a market system is crucial to increasing the systems’  
    climate resilience and to ensuring the long-term viability of interventions under the  
    scheme.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  It recommended that year-on-year budget of the AMI sub-component of the scheme should  
    not be reduced. Rather a rigorous planning & progress tracking should be undertaken under  
    the scheme in consultation with the states to improve market infrastructure, banking  
    facility, digital connectivity and other facilities in these markets. Emphasis should  
    particularly be laid on strengthening infrastructure and civic facilities at fruits and  
    vegetable market and strengthening of Gramin Haat

C. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  In order to improve its content and outreach, special market information and intelligence  
    cell may be set-up or existing departments may be strengthened within the state agriculture  
    marketing boards. For this purpose support may be extended to the state for development  
    of ICT based solution to communicating technical, economic and market information to the  
    producers and department staff, preparation and dissemination of commodity outlook  
    reports, creating a database of buyers, traders, agribusiness and transporters, hiring of  
    qualified manpower such as market analyst, IT expert etc to staff the cell.
2.  The scheme's performance has been good, however, the overall achievements have been  
    limited to select states/ regions which limits the impact of the scheme for development of  
    the sector. Therefore, it is suggested to engage actively with other states/ regions which are  
    lagging in implementation of scheme's activities.
3.  The IT infrastructure in e-NAM needs to be updated as suggested above a comprehensive  
    business process reengineering of e-NAM covering all processes and infrastructure needs  
    to be carried out. E-NAM can play a significant role in building transparent markets &  
    pricing systems. Thereby, help the farmer to negotiate the contracts better and also  
    improve access to finance by enabling more robust business planning and thus better

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

appreciation of market risks by lender. Therefore, the implementation of this activity

should to be taken up on priority for greater impact.

1.  It is recommended that all state implementing agency should adopt a web based IT model  
    for implementation of the scheme which would ensure efficiency of the system.

D. Capacity building

1.  Regular training and capacity building of market functionaries and implementing agency  
    staff should also be carried out. Although the training needs will come from training needs  
    assessment, an indicative list of trainings may include planning and implementation for  
    market improvement, preparation and implementation of operations and maintenance  
    plans for the market, post-harvest management; marketing and market extension,  
    maintenance of records and accounts, and market charge estimation and collection.
2.  The capacity building component of the scheme should particularly focus on improving the  
    farmer capacity to comply with market quality standards to improve their market access  
    (including for exports). Simultaneously, exposure should be provided to farmers and trader  
    representatives on scientific and advance quality testing procedures for hands-on learning  
    on how quality compliance can positively impacts the product pricing, access to distant and  
    larger market (including for exports), ease the conduct trade.
3.  Futures markets can be an important risk management tool for farmers in times of  
    increased price volatility. In this area in particular, awareness-raising and training  
    measures in the farming community and farmers ́ organizations should be prioritized.
4.  Capacity building support/ hand-holding assistance should be provided particularly to  
    farmer producer groups and traders to boost their confidence to trade on e-platforms. This  
    will help in uptake of eNAM among member farmers/ fellow traders and CA and increase  
    the volumetric trade.
5.  As a part of training, research and consultancy component of the scheme gender analysis  
    coupled with market research should be performed to gain deeper understanding of gender  
    dimension in agricultural markets as well as mapping the most suitable crops or production  
    systems or value chain activities, which should be prioritized for gender equity and  
    efficiency gains. Accordingly, strategic action plans should be developed to direct the  
    investment and support toward developing markets in ways that contribute to gender  
    equity and reduce poverty. For example, if more number of women farmers use traditional  
    production systems, it relatively easier for them to meet certain certification requirements,  
    such as those for organic production. Some essential elements of capacity building for  
    Women stakeholder may include improving their access to market information, technology  
    adaptation, credit supply, and land reform.

E. Convergence with other schemes and programs

1.  Convergence with other scheme/ programme/initiatives of center and state government,  
    developmental organizations and private sector should be encouraged for creating  
    backward and forward linkage and development of an integrated value chain.

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

Agricultural marketing comprises all operations involved in the movement of farm

produce from the producer to the ultimate consumer which includes operations like

collecting, grading, processing, preserving, transportation and financing. The scheme

seeks to facilitate agricultural marketing removing all inefficiencies of the market

thereby becoming a major enabler for doubling farmers’ Income.

2.2.9 Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region

Background of the Scheme

Overuse of natural resources, over dependence on chemical pesticides and fertilizers have

brought down the productivity of the Indian farm lands. These issues have culminated to

decreasing the profitability of the farmers involved. Global issues like increasing frequency of

occurrence of extreme weather events like droughts and floods have also been witnessed in the

Indian subcontinent, affecting the agricultural productivity.

These problems can only be tackled by adoption of organic farming practices in order to utilize

the natural resources in a judicious way and lowering the dependence on the agro chemicals. The

North-Eastern states of India have a high potential in terms of capitalizing their pool of natural

resources and channelizing the same towards harnessing their agricultural capabilities. Bringing

about agricultural transformation in the North Eastern states of India has mostly been untapped

and the region’s strategic agro climatic position has set the stage for North Eastern states to be

the next big agricultural hub for the nation.

Realizing this, and the potential which lies in the adoption of organic farming, the **Mission**

**Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region** has been started by the

Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers’ Welfare (DAC&FW) as a sub mission of

National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). The mission is dedicated to be implemented

in eight states of the North East, namely, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur,

Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura during the 12th plan period. The scheme has been planned

to build and strengthen the certified organic production by creating an entire value chain for the

particular commodity, starting from various agricultural inputs for production to the collection,

aggregation, processing and last mile marketing of the produce by initiating a brand for the

organic produce.

Objectives of the programme

The key objectives of the mission are as follows^256 :

A. To develop crop commodity specific organic value chain and address gaps in organic crop

production, wild crop harvesting, organic livestock management and processing handling and

marketing of organic agricultural products through:

i. Developing crop specific organic production clusters with necessary infrastructural, technical

and financial support

ii. By facilitating partnerships between farmers and organic businesses: Local enterprises and /

or Farmer Producer Companies based on back-to-back long-term trade relations with clients in

domestic and export markets.

iii. By providing enabling environment for project initiatives and development programs with

necessary support for organic value chain development and create market access.

B. To empower producers with program ownership by organizing them into FIGs with the final

aim to federate into farmer producer organizations/ companies

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

C. To replace conventional farming/subsistence farming system into local resource based, self-

sustainable, high value commercial organic enterprise

D. Developing commodity specific commercial organic value chain under integrated and

concentrated approach with end-to-end facilities for production, processing, storage and

marketing

E. Development of organic parks/zones with facilities for collection, aggregation, value addition,

processing, storage and market-linkages for specific commodities requiring capital intensive

technology

F. Develop NER products as brands/labels through brand building and facilitating stronger

marketing access under the ownership of growers’ organizations/ companies.

G. Creating state specific lead agency (Organic Commodity Board or Organic Mission) for

coordinating, monitoring, supporting and financing the development and operationalization of

entire value chain.

The objectives once met, will then help in subsequent achievement of the **goals of the mission** ,

as follows:

1.  To install dedicated institutional systems at centre and under each of the state for development

and promotion of organic farming

1.  To create at least one to two replicable end-to-end organic value chain models in each of the

state with the integration of growers, handlers, processors, and market facilitation agencies.

1.  To empower 30-50 thousand farmers of North Eastern region through the creation of about

100 farmer producer companies and equip such companies with full value chain under its

ownership.

1.  To convert subsistence farming to commercial organic farming with end-to-end facilities
2.  To make North Eastern states as major suppliers of organic commodities for national and

international markets.

1.  To improve production system to ensure higher productivity with better profitability.
2.  To enable states to evolve their own brand.

Major Components of the MOVCDNER

The major components of MOVCDNER can be divided into four broad categories, Value Chain

Production, Value Chain Processing, Value Chain Marketing and Value Chain Support Agencies.

These components can further be classified into sub components with several sub components,

with specific activities as has been depicted below:

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Figure 161 : Components of MOVCDNER

The sub components under the main heads, are carried out through several activities, the last

revised operational guidelines of the scheme were published in December, 2018^257.

Institutional Framework

MOVCDNER is implemented at the state level through a State Lead Agency which works in the

form of “Organic Mission” or “Organic Board” under the holistic supervision received from the

DAC&FW. The state lead agencies are primarily independent bodies being operated by qualified

contractual staff. Various national and state level committees are formed for the successful

implementation of the mission. Each of these committees have well defined roles and objectives

to be met. At the local level, several service providers are also appointed, who mainly operate as

handholding agencies and extend support to the Farmer Producer Organizations/Companies

(FPO / FPC) at the grassroots level.

Key Activities

The key activities that are performed in MOVCDNER are as follows:

• Mobilization of commodity clusters

• Facilitation of capacity building, handholding, and infrastructure creation for on-farm

input production, training on package of practices and facilitating certification services to

farmers.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Creation and linking of enterprises which include local enterprises as well as Farmer

Producer Companies (FPC). These enterprises once facilitated by MOVCDNER, will

operate collection, aggregation and post-harvest processes, trade organic products and

provide necessary services to farmers and to work towards increasing their market.

• Lead agencies at the state level are created under MOVCDNER which in in turn partner

with value chain supporting agencies, service providers and institute business

development consultancies.

• Under MOVCDNER, critical services like access to information, technical know-how,

financial management and other required management practices to the enterprises along

with stimulating the market growth are regularly performed.

Intended Contribution to the Sectoral Performance

The dynamics of Indian agriculture has witnessed quite a number of positive strides in the past

few years. Important umbrella schemes like Green Revolution – Krishonnati Yojana have

amalgamated and streamlined several ongoing schemes along with new ones to target the issues

and challenges of the agriculture sector of the country in a much more holistic way.

The National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), one of the major schemes under the

Krishonnati Yojana, have several sub components which are considered separate missions in

themselves, One such scheme, Mission on Soil Health Management (SHM) has incorporated the

adoption of organic agriculture across the country. Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) is

the scheme which is focused solely towards the adoption of chemical free organic farming in the

country. Keeping these advancements in mind, and the suitability and potential of the North

Eastern states of the country to become important hubs of organic farming, a much more targeted

scheme MOVCDNER was launched to be implemented across the eight North Eastern States of the

India. The North Eastern states of the country have an inherent advantage in the adoption and

long term continuation of organic farming practices due to the uniqueness in the agro climatic

conditions of these hilly areas which support the organic practices to be adopted easily as the

agriculture is primarily rainfed with minimal use of chemical fertilizers required as the soil is rich

in organic matter. The scheme was scheduled to be implemented in these states for a period of

three years starting from 2015-16 to 2017-2018. Drawing its similarities from PKVY, MOVCDNER

also targeted to eradicate the supply chain management constraints in the specific geography for

which it was designed. Under MOVCDNER , assistance is provided to the farmers in a value chain

mode starting from formation of Farmers Producer Organizations (FPOs), on/off farm input

production, supply of seeds/ planting materials, post-harvest infrastructure including collection,

sorting, grading facilities, establishment of integrated processing unit, refrigerated

transportation, pre-cooling/ cold stores chamber, branding, labelling and packaging, etc.^258

Intended Contribution to the National and International Goals

Globally, the agricultural practices adopted have reached a crossroad. Decades of chemically

intensive agriculture has taken a toll on the overall ecology, affecting the major natural resources

like, soil, ground water, and biodiversity among others. There is need to shift towards much more

responsible and sustainable ways of agriculture which will be environment friendly and

simultaneously people need to understand the essence of responsible consumption and

production practices.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Organic agriculture supports and enhances ecologically sound systems of food production that

can achieve **food security** by increasing and stabilizing yields, improving resistance to pests and

diseases, and battling poverty through reducing debt incurred by the purchase of expensive

chemical inputs. This will help in **ensuring good health and well-being** across age groups and a

significant contribution can be made to curb down the harmful effects of agriculture on people

and planet. A global move towards organic agriculture will further contribute towards

**conserving water bodies** by limiting the pesticide runoff into the waterways, help in soil

management and reduce land degradation through use of cover crops, crop rotation, organic

manure and thus help in sequestering more carbon, **reversing the effects of climate change** and

**protecting the ecosystem** on the whole**.** Setting this context, MOVCDNER can be linked to both

the global as well as national agenda towards a sustainable future, as follows:

Performance of the Scheme

Financial Performance

The below table shows the budgeted, released and actual estimates under MOVCDNER. From the

figure it can be interpreted that starting from 2015-16, the year-on-year (YoY) budgeted and

revised estimates have reduced till 2017-18. The financial performance also gives a very clear

representation of the fact that there is a significant gap between the actual released amount and

the amount which was allocated under MOVCDNER at the end of the three years.

In the category of area covered almost all the states have fared well except Mizoram. In terms of

formation of clusters/ FIGs, Tripura has a stellar performance achieving more than 100% of its

set target.

The data on output and outcomes is not available for the scheme.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• MOVCDNER targets to eradicate the supply chain management constraints in the specific

geography for which it was designed. Under MOVCDNER, assistance is provided to the

farmers in a value chain mode starting from formation of FPOs, on/ off farm input

production, supply of seeds/ planting materials, post-harvest infrastructure including

collection, sorting, grading facilities, establishment of integrated processing unit,

refrigerated transportation, pre-cooling/ cold stores chamber, branding, labelling and

packaging, etc.

• The scheme is highly relevant for the development of agriculture sector and is in-line with

future requirements for sustainable growth. The output-outcome indicators can be

strengthened in consultation with the ministry for effective monitoring and impact

assessment of the scheme.

• The output indicators cover most of the components and objectives of the scheme, except

in relation to marketing initiatives and brand labels being launched by the FPOs and

improvement due to such interventions.

**Effectiveness**

• MOVCDNER physical targets have been defined in terms of area to be covered under

organic farming, numbers of Farmer Income Groups (FIGs) created, the number of Farmer

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Producer Organizations (FPOs) or Farmer Producer Companies created under the scheme

and the total number of farmers mobilized.

o In the category of area covered almost all the states have fared well except

Mizoram.

o In terms of formation of clusters/ FIGs, Tripura has a stellar performance

achieving more than 100% of its set target.

• The data on output and outcomes is not available for the scheme and needs to be

monitored for assessing effectiveness of the scheme.

**Efficiency**

• The average utilization of funds at the central level has been comparatively low over last

four years at 79%. The utilization of funds improved during 2018- 19 at 96%.

• However, the utilization of these funds at the state level is important to realize intended

objectives of the scheme. On an average, the participating states were only able to spend

close to 50% of the amount which they had actually received.

• Therefore, as highlighted above, efficient utilization of funds at central and state level is

required which can further improve the performance of the scheme.

**Sustainability**

• Value addition and marketing are two of the components which are essential for adoption

of organic farming among farmers along with promotion of production in the region.

• Long duration for transportation and lack of storage, etc. leads to wastage of produce in

the region and discourages farmers involved in organic farming.

• Private sector needs to be engaged and linked to the FPOs being promoted for sustainable

operations and better price realization for farmers.

• There are several challenges faced by farmers to sustain their operations and stay

motivated to practice organic farming. Therefore, the frequency of training programs

need to be increased in order to engage with farmers for higher participation.

**Impact**

• Considering that there is nearly 5.5 million hectares of cultivated land available in the

North East, organic farming barely covers 3% of arable land. The potential is very high for

the region to go organic. The scheme has been able to double the area under organic

cultivation in NE states since 2016-17.

• Therefore, this presents a case to reassess the allocation of funds towards the scheme

along with concerted efforts for better utilization.

**Equity**

• The demographic distribution in NER is such that the female and backward groups’

participation would be automatically getting aligned under the scheme. It is still

recommended that in order to ensure equitable distribution of resources, the

participation of women and backward groups should be maintained at the central and

state level.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Cross Sectional Thematic Areas**

i. Accountability and Transparency

The accountability and transparency aspects associated with MOVCDNER can be well understood

and interpreted from the institutional framework of the mission. The overall mission activities

are tracked and monitored by the DAC&FW. A National Advisory Committee (NAC) has also been

set up in order to develop the required policies and drive the progress of the scheme towards the

set objectives. NAC is also responsible for review and monitor the progress and performance of

the mission.

In the hierarchical structure, just below NAC there is the Executive Committee (EC) of the

MOVCDNER. EC has been given the responsibility for approval of proposal/projects from the state

action plan, collaborate with other line departments in order to achieve the mission objectives,

provide necessary clarification on the implementing issues and also apprise the NAC at regular

periodic intervals.

The most vital part of monitoring and evaluation of MOVCDNER, is being taken care by the Mission

Monitoring Committee (MMC). The MMC is headed by the Joint Secretary, INM and is empowered

to constitute monitoring teams, reviewing the progress of the ongoing activities executed by the

Project Management Unit (PMU). The executive committee at the national level, also has a state

level counterpart known as the State Level Executive Committee (SLEC).The effective

implementation of the activities under MOVCDNER is the sole responsibility of the SLEC. The

nodal agency for the implementation of the programme is the State Lead Agency (SLA) formed

under the jurisdiction of the SLEC and formed by recruiting trained manpower on a contractual

basis. The SLA in involved in doing an array of work starting from receiving of funds to hiring of

resource agencies required for formation of FPCs, facilitation of farming inputs, involving

professional agencies for the marketing and branding of the produce, facilitate awareness by

organizing seminars, workshops, printed literature and ensure timely information flow as

mandated by the PMU.

The fund flow involved in MOVCDNER has started and the funds are released once all the

necessary approvals are in place from SLEC and EC after they have reviewed the comprehensive

action plan that has been prepared by the state. The funds are also not released at a single go, but

are divided into multiple instalments, disbursed from time to time. Thus, through all these checks

and balances established by formation of national and state level bodies and implementation of

proper monitoring framework, MOVCDNER takes care of its transparency and accountability

aspects.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

However, the scheme needs to improve transparency as no information about scheme progress

is available on public domain. The information on RCs and district local level registered under the

scheme can be accessed from PGS portal^259.

ii. Direct / indirect employment generation

MOVCDNER has played an instrumental role in increasing and creation of employment

opportunities for the existing farmers and interested youth respectively. Impact evaluation

studies conducted on MOVCDNER provides evidence to the fact that the mission has been

successful in generating improved returns for the farmers involved in organic farming practices,

through development of entire value chain of various crops and establishing market linkages for

the organic produce. The scheme, however, does not currently track the employment generated

as the data has not been provided by the department.

iii. Gender Mainstreaming

In the North Eastern region of the country, the female workforce participation has been on the

higher side as compared to the rest of the country. The highest female workforce participation

among the North Eastern states is recorded by Nagaland (~45%). So it can be concluded that

women play a pivotal role in contributing to the workforce of these states. MOVCDNER, though

does not talk explicitly on gender mainstreaming, there is ample scope for inclusion of this

component under the operational guidelines of the mission.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Table 72 : Statewise Work Force Participation Rate 2011

iv. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the

scheme in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

All the eight states in the North Eastern Region (NER), have been the home to numerous number

of tribal groups, including both Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs). Apart from

Assam, in the seven other states the average rural population of STs is nearly 70% whereas, this

figure is very negligible in case of the SC population. This indicates a clear majority of the STs

across the North Eastern states.

Though there hasn’t been any clear mention of the integration of MOVCDNER with the TSP, as the

major population in the rural areas of the north eastern states belong to some Scheduled Tribe,

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

the majority of the beneficiary base included under the scheme is automatically getting aligned

with the targeted beneficiary group under TSP or SC Sub Plan.

Source: Census 2011

v. Climate Change and Sustainability including Climate Change Resilient practices

and diversifications

The adoption of organic farming practices has been evolved from safeguarding the harmful effects

on natural resources and health of the soil from mainstream farming practices which have been

using chemical fertilizers and pesticides without any bounds in order to increase the productivity.

Organic farming practices were envisioned to curb down these harmful effects and utilization of

climate resilient ways to cultivate and reap long term sustainable benefits from the same.

MOVCDNER also takes into its ambit creation of awareness among the farmers and the consumers

the positive aspects linked with organic farming and the associated environmental benefits which

come along.

vi. Development, dissemination and adoption of innovative practices technology and

know-how through Technology / Adoption of ICT

One of the objectives of MOVCDNER is establishing capital intensive technology for specific

commodities through creation of organic parks/ zones to facilitate the processes of collection,

Table 73 : SC ST Population, Sex Ratio & their proportion to Total Population in NER

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

aggregation, value addition, processing, storage and market linkages. Integrated Processing Units

are set up having the required technology as per the appropriate standard and market acceptance.

The assistance for establishment of such units through MOVCDNER is given to individual

entrepreneurs or FPOs/FPCs/FIGs. The technology aspects incorporated in MOVCDNER can also

be witnessed in the establishment of Integrated Pack Houses, cold storages, refrigerated vehicles.

The required trainings which the farmers should have in order to become accustomed with these

technologies, is facilitated by Regional Centres of Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology

(IIFPT) and is monetarily backed by subsidies provided by North Eastern Development Financial

Corporation Ltd (NEDFi).

The PMU also plays a critical role in coordinating the development of appropriate technology

packages for crop production, processing, packaging etc. through ICAR and other technology

development institutes.

vii. Stakeholder and beneficiary behaviour change

For MOVCDNER the farmers who have taken up organic farming across the eight states of NER

are the main beneficiaries of the scheme. The technological interventions taken up under

MOVCDNER have benefitted the individual farmers as well as the FIGs. The impact study

conducted by MANAGE mentions that the level of interests have improved among the farmers and

the FIGs/FPOs for adoption of organic farming. This interest has mainly been shown towards the

use of bio fertilizers, organic seed, organic manure etc. This shows that there has been positive

reception of the organic farming practices among the farmers. Farmers were also mobilized in a

well-structured manner through the mobilization activities which have reduced the overall costs

and increased the profits. Farmers have also benefitted from the trainings and exposure visits

which they have received.

**viii. Unlocking Synergies with other government programmes**

MOVCDNER has very close knit linkages with few other government schemes which are also

working in the space of organic farming and other allied sectors. One of the most similar

government scheme with which MOVCDNER is very much related to is Paramparagat Krishi Vikas

Yojana (PKVY). Another important scheme which draws similarities with MOVCDNER is National

Project on Organic Farming (NPOF).

ix. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives (e.g.

Farmer cooperatives, FPOs, Water User Associations, etc.) and civil society in the

scheme

In order to adopt and practice large scale organic farming, to generate reasonable income

opportunities for the farmers involved, availability of the infrastructural support is a must. The

North Eastern states of India have been lacking availability of agricultural infrastructure. Under

these circumstances, it is essential to explore and materialize public private partnership models

which will help in establishing the infrastructural support required for the long term

sustainability of the organic farming in NER.

MOVCDNER encourages value chain approach towards organic farming through cluster

development and formation of FPOs/FPCs. This particular approach has eased the

implementation of the scheme in terms of extension of the technical support in areas like training,

handholding, certification, collection and aggregation. Each of the eight states where the scheme

was implemented were given separate targets for creation of FPOs. The FPOs and the private

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

agencies are the ones who were responsible for pulling the funds allotted to MOVCDNER, but

there was limited knowledge among them regarding the modalities and the functioning of

MOVCDNER. Few of the FPOs have created their own brands and further got their products

certified under the PGS-India standards. The FPOs can get a holistic benefit by not only limiting

their activities to the ones stated under MOVCDNER but also aligning themselves to the benefits

of other centrally sponsored government schemes like PKVY, NPOF etc.

The discussion of the cross thematic areas for the scheme has been summarized below:

**Discussion on sector specific thematic assessment**

_Jhum Cultivation_

The primitive practice of performing shifting (Jhum) cultivation has been widely practiced in the

North Eastern states of India. The practice is mainly dominant in these states of the country

because of the hilly terrain and the practice is adopted by the tribal population residing in these

hilly areas. The practice involves the burning of phytomass (including forest floors) resulting in

colossal loss of vegetation cover and top fertile soil (Punitha, 2018). The usual cycle of this pattern

of cultivation followed a higher frequency cycle, which has now been brought down to 2-3 years

primarily because of the ever-growing human population pressure and the decreasing

agricultural productivity of the lands^260. Thus many researchers have suggested to adopt a

multidimensional strategy by the government, the Jhumias involved in Jhum cultivation and the

agencies/organizations involved in Jhum improvement programmes like NGOs, NERCORMP,

forest department, village level communities etc.

Issues and Challenges

The North eastern states of India face several issues and challenges which account for relatively

lower development in the region in comparison to other parts of the country.

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  **Gaps in Marketing –** Lack of market linkages for selling the agricultural produce,  
    especially inability to fetch higher prices for organic agricultural produce. There have  
    been low publicity efforts on the part of the FPCs/ FPOs to promote their brands. Lack  
    of any specific market for the selling of the organic produce also adds to the distress  
    of the farmers. The farmers have limited alternative marketing options and have to  
    sell off their produce at the village level to the middlemen/ wholesalers.
2.  **Limited infrastructure and technical support–** Lack of agricultural infrastructure  
    like farm level amenities, latest farm inputs which use technologies, dedicated  
    markets, pack houses, cold storages, sorting and grading lines and processing  
    industries. Private investments to develop infrastructure which will support the  
    supply chain and help in effective transportation of the produce is yet to be developed.  
    Poor penetration of latest technological interventions due to inadequate support staff  
    for extension activities.
3.  **Jhum cultivation-** The practice of Jhum cultivation i.e. shifting cultivation which has  
    been quite prevalent in the North Eastern States, have deteriorated the productivity  
    of the land.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  **Delay in release of funds and underutilization by states –** For most of the states,  
    there has been a delay in release of funds from the central authorities. This has  
    resulted in delay in establishment of functional infrastructure by the FPOs / FPCs.

C. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  The output indicators cover most of the components and objectives of the scheme, except  
    in relation to marketing initiatives and brand labels being launched by the FPOs and  
    improvement due to such interventions.

D. Capacity building

1.  **Mobilization of farmers -** Evaluation study conducted on MOVCDNER, shows that much  
    more efforts are needed in terms of mobilization of farmers towards the adoption of organic  
    farming practices. This can be attributed to lower number of training programmes  
    organized under the scheme compared to potential, though the farmer participation in the  
    trainings held was good.

Key Reasons for Low Fund Utilization for Certain Components and Among

States:

• Delay in release of funds from centre to states and under utlisation of funds by

state government have been cited as the reason for slow performance of

scheme. The reported fund utlisation by states is quite low at 60%.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

E. Convergence

1.  **Logistics and Transportation** - Transportation of the agricultural produce has been a  
    pertinent problem across the North Eastern parts of the country. Transportation costs are  
    extremely high when the farmers try to sell their produce in the urban markets.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions

The key recommendations for the scheme are provided below.

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  Value addition and marketing are two of the components which are essential for adoption  
    of organic farming among farmers. There is need to focus on development of these  
    components for better price realization to farmers along with promotion of production in  
    the region.
2.  The development of supporting infrastructure is important for reduction in wastages of  
    organic produce in the region, as long duration for transportation and lack of storage, etc.  
    lead to wastage of produce and discourage farmers involved in organic farming. Specific  
    budgets need to be allocated for deputing required dedicated officers for promotion of  
    organic farming in the states and districts. Moreover, markets need to be established and  
    promoted for sale of organic produce directly to consumers.
3.  Promotion of organic farming will help in shifting away from Jhum cultivation.
4.  Considering that there is nearly 5.5 million hectares of cultivated land available in the North  
    East, organic farming barely covers 3% of arable land. The potential is very high for the  
    region to go organic. The Scheme has been able to double the area under organic cultivation  
    in NE states since 2016-17. Therefore, this presents a case to reassess the allocation of funds  
    towards the scheme along with concerted efforts for better utilization. As of 2018-19, the  
    status of organic cultivation in North East is as below:

1.  While the demographic distribution in NER is such that the female and backward groups  
    participation would be undertaken under the scheme. It is recommended that in order to  
    ensure equitable distribution of resources, the participation of women and backward  
    groups should be maintained at the central and state level.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  The average utilization of funds at the central level has been comparatively low over last  
    four years at 79%. The utilization of funds improved during 2018-19 at 96%, however, the  
    utilization of these funds at the state level is important to realize intended objectives of the  
    scheme. Therefore, as highlighted above, efficient utilization of funds at central and state  
    level is required which can further improve the performance of the scheme.

C. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  The scheme is highly relevant for the development of agriculture sector and is in-line with  
    future requirements for sustainable growth. The output-outcome indicators can be  
    strengthened in consultation with the ministry for effective monitoring and impact  
    assessment of the scheme.
2.  With respect to the outcome indicators, the indicators related to number of NER labels  
    launched in the market may be considered as an output, and accordingly the outcomes can  
    be revised to include the impact of interventions on livelihoods of farmers in form of  
    increased production, improvement in productivity, land fertility, better price realization  
    for produce, among others.

D. Capacity building

1.  As highlighted above that organic farming, while is an urgent requirement to be adopted by  
    farmers at a larger scale, there are several challenges faced by farmers to sustain their  
    operations and stay motivated to practice organic farming. Therefore, the frequency of  
    training programs need to be increased in order to engage with farmers for higher  
    participation.

o The private sector can be sensitized for establishment of operations in the region

and linked to the FPOs being promoted for sustainable operations and better price

realization for farmers.

o To scale up adoption of organic farming in the country, in addition to sensitization

and promotion of practices, it is important to develop innovative and scalable

solutions with respect to infrastructure, processing, marketing, etc. through

dedicated research and development in the field. While there have been

partnerships with ICAR and technology development institutes established under

the scheme, it is suggested to allocate a certain proportion of funds for action-

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

oriented R&D specific to the agro-climatic conditions of the region for promotion

and wider implementation of organic farming.

o FPOs/ FPCs need adequate handholding and relevant training in order to operate

their business and subsequently grow their earning for benefit of members. It is

important to provide training to board of directors of FPOs/ FPCs on financial,

managerial, operational aspects for long term sustainability of the companies

being formed under the scheme.

o The PGS certified products needs to be promoted among all the stakeholders

including end-consumers for higher acceptability and better price realization of

produce for farmers.

E. Convergence

1.  Private players which are involved in interstate trade can be contacted and tie-ups needs to  
    be established with logistic players. Refer vehicles and cold chain infrastructure can be  
    promoted to reduce wastage and losses during transportation. The scheme can also offer  
    transport subsidy to reduce the burden on farmers.
2.  In addition to MOVCD-NER, there are other schemes such as NERLP which focus on  
    development of NER. Moreover, the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region  
    focusses on planning and execution of schemes/ projects in NER for socio-economic  
    development. It is suggested that convergence/ coordination of activities with such other  
    initiatives in NER can assist in making a greater impact in an efficient manner.

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

This scheme seems to be already subsumed under NMSA as sub-components/ sub-missions.

MOVCD-NER is suggested to be merged with PKVY as it has similar implementation

mechanism and objectives, with difference being the geographical spread.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

2.2.10 Soil Health Management^261

Background of the Scheme

Many important interventions under NMSA are implemented under Soil Health Management.

SHM is implemented by Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) Division of DAC&FW. Some of the

critical interventions under Soil Health Management (SHM) are

• Soil Health Card

• Soil Health

• INM and organic component

• Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY)

• National Centre for Organic Farming

Soil Health Management aims at promoting location as well as crop specific, sustainable soil

health management practices. Soil Health Card generated under this component helps in judicious

use of fertilizers as per soil health and crop requirements.

These components are being implemented by State Govt., National Centre of Organic Farming

(NCOF), Central Fertilizer Quality Control & Training Institute (CFQC&TI) and sanctioned by INM

division.

**Soil Health Card and Soil Health Management (SHC/SHM)**

The scheme was introduced in 2015 to assist State Governments to issue soil health cards to all

farmers in the country. Soil health card helps in promoting judicious use of fertilizers by providing

information on nutrient status of agricultural soil to farmers. The SHC also contains

recommendation on appropriate dosage of nutrients for maintaining soil health and fertility^262.

**Objectives**^263

• To promote soil test based nutrient management across the country

• To issue soil health cards every three years to all farmers across the country

• Strengthen the functioning of soil testing laboratories and associated infrastructure

• Capacity building of district and state level staff for promotion of nutrient management

practices

• To diagnose soil fertility related constraints with standardized procedures for sampling

uniformly across states; and analyse and design fertilizer recommendations.

**Components**

• Soil testing and issue of soil health card (SHC)

• Soil Health Management for creation of necessary infrastructure for implementation of

scheme

**Implementation structure and stakeholders**

Soil health card and soil health management schemes follows the implementation structure of

NMSA. It has a three tier structure. At national level a National Advisory Committee (NAC) under

Chairmanship of Secretary (A&C) is responsible for providing strategic direction and guidance for

planning. The committee has Additional Secretary and Financial Advisor, Additional secretary

(INM), representatives from agricultural and research institutes, and Joint secretaries from NMH,

crops, NRM&RFS and INM division as members.

Summary of different bodies that have been set up and their corresponding roles has been

depicted through the figure below.

Figure 163 : Institutional Framework

**Intended contribution to sectoral challenges**

With increasing climatic variation, fluctuation in rainfall, increasing temperature and reducing

ground water table, agriculture is becoming more vulnerable to climate change. Intensive

agriculture and excessive use of fertilisers is affecting soil health in many areas. Maintaining soil

health is critical for sustained agricultural production. In view of this soil health management

component has been formulated under NMSA. SHM has following central sector and centrally

sponsored components.

• Soil Health Card

• Soil Health

• INM and organic component

• Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY)

• National Centre for Organic Farming

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The soil health card scheme has been launched in mission mode to benefit all farmers.

Infrastructure of soil testing labs, training of human resources has also been carried out to

strengthen infrastructure for soil testing. These activities are targeted towards efficient use of

fertiliser and improving soil health which will ultimately result in reduced input cost and better

yield for farmers. This is expected to contribute positively to farmer’s income.

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

The scheme through its components contributes directly towards national development

objectives of doubling farmer’s income, employment generation and entrepreneurship

development. NITI Aayog’s ‘Strategy for New India @ 75’ has outlined doubling farmers’ income

as priority area for national development. Integrated nutrient management helps in contributing

towards improved and sustainable income by improving or maintaining soil health. In addition,

the scheme also contributes towards attaining targets under following SDGs, some of them have

been detailed below:

• Goal 1: No poverty- Integrated nutrient management is can help in reducing input cost

and improving crop yield this is can lead to sustained and improved income

• Goal 2: Zero Hunger- Soil health management helps in improving fertility and

maintaining sustained production, it can also help in restoration of problem soil which

can help in making infertile land fertile making it suitable for agriculture activities

• Goal 13: Climate action-This is a part of National mission on sustainable agriculture of the

missions under National Action Plan on Climate Change

• Goal 17: Partnership for goals are being created through this programme by establishing

convergence with other schemes such as PMKSY, RAD, MIDH and components of NMSA,

soil testing labs with public private partnerships are also being encouraged etc.

First cycle of the scheme saw 100% achievement of targets in terms of sample collection, testing,

printing and dispatch. During cycle II, the number of samples to be collected increased. States of

Delhi, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa and Sikkim have not yet completed 100% collection of

sample. States of Bihar and West Bengal have entered less than 1% of information collected on

portal and have not completed the testing of samples.

Along with soil health card, it is important to strengthen the infrastructure to achieve results in

the quantum specified in SHC mission objective. Government of India has spent nearly Rs 316.4

crores to develop and strengthen soil testing infrastructure in India. The progress achieved since

2014 - 15 is highlighted below:

With more than 100 million soil health card dispatched in each cycle the scheme has progressed

well in recent years. The impact evaluation study conducted by MANAGE in 2017 highlighted

positive impact in reduction in use of fertiliser among farmers who received SHC. The

recommendation has also helped in encouraging essential micronutrient in cultivation. Moderate

increase in crop yield has also been observed after following soil health card recommendations^265.

Among the farmers who followed recommendations, reduction in input costs and positive impact

on crop yield contributed positively in increasing their income. The progress on output and

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• SHM through its components contributes directly towards national development

objectives of doubling farmer’s income, integrated nutrient management helps in

contributing towards improved and sustainable income by improving or maintaining soil

health.

• However, the scheme is target oriented. KIIs revealed that the KVKs operational at the

field level are undertaking testing of about 150-200 samples per day for issuance of soil

health cards. However, as per standards about 20-25 samples per day can only be dry

tested for issuance of soil health cards. Therefore, many of the recommendations for soil

heath cards issued are similar with little variations and there is need to upgrade the

capacity for intended impact of interventions.

• The scheme needs to include some of the qualitative indicators such as number of farmers

who have adopted recommendations, improvement in production/ productivity from

adoption of recommendations, time taken from collection of sample to issuance of soil

health card, etc.

**Effectiveness**

• First cycle of the scheme saw 100% achievement of targets in terms of sample collection,

testing, printing and dispatch. During cycle II, the number of samples to be collected

increased.

• The data for output and outcome indicators shows good progress of the scheme and more

than 100% achievement of targets on almost all of the reported indicators.

• However, poor mass acceptability of soil testing services is a concern, hence, there is a

need to establish fully automated soil testing labs with trained human resources.

• In many states fertiliser distribution is not in-line with SHC prescription identified for the

state and therefore, policies need to be defined in-consultation with all the stakeholders.

• Reclamation of problem soil is not yet covered under the scheme since focus is on

providing prescription. The effectiveness of the prescription needs to be tested.

**Efficiency**

• The funds released for Soil health card increased gradually over the years. The funds

under SHM on the other hand have shown a fluctuating trend.

• Only 30% of SHCs contain information on micro-nutrients.

• SHC does not cover aspects such as time of application of fertilisers and method of

application which is very important for efficient utilization of resources.

• Identified areas with problem soil can be targeted and convergence can be established

with other schemes for their treatment, successful treatment of problem soil based on the

SHC recommendations can serve as an example and good practices for others to emulate.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Sustainability**

• SHC can be promoted with other trainings/ areas such as integrated pest management,

good agriculture practices, alternative crops, water requirement, time of sowing and

suitable time for application of fertilisers.

• Very few trainings and awareness generation activities have been conducted under the

scheme, considering the scheme targets farmers across country these activities need to be

encouraged.

**Impact**

• The impact evaluation study conducted by MANAGE in 2017 highlighted positive impact

in reduction in use of fertiliser among farmers who received SHC.

• Recently introduced model village programme needs to be monitored closely to see its

impact, the differences observed in project and control needs to be examined.

• While number of SHCs have been issued, impact of scheme in terms of adoption of

recommendations by farmers and impact of recommendations on overall productivity of

crop and soil health still needs to be assessed.

**Equity**

• SHC and SHM have been targeted at improvement of soil health where grids have been

selected, it does not have beneficiary oriented components or trainings. None of the

activity has been targeted with specific focus on gender, however, there is no

discrimination in mission implementation.

• There are no special incentives or provisions to ensure Scheduled Castes, Scheduled

Tribes and other weaker segments of society participation in the scheme.

• The programme has created awareness among small and marginal farmers.

• 67.4% SC/ST farmers have awareness about SHC. However, only 19.8% are aware about

the portal.

**Discussion on Cross Sectional Thematic Areas**

i. Accountability and Transparency

The implementation structure of SHM has got three important layers at the national, state and

district levels. This three level structure ensures that there remains a high level of accountability

in the entire system. The SHC website can be accessed at https://soilhealth.dac.gov.in and has

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

comprehensive database and detailed information on the scheme and its progress. Scheme

guidelines, progress data and soil health cards that have been generated under the scheme are

available on public domain. District wise, village wise, as well as grid wise farmer name and soil

health card issued can be accessed from the website. GPS coordinate of the sites are taken during

sample collection, this is needed so that the sample can be taken from the same site again to

monitor soil health over a period. The overall samples are being used to develop state and national

level soil health maps and district specific recommendations on soil health, moreover the soil

health cards are being issued in more than 12 languages and in some cases even in local dialects

to ensure that the farmers understand and follow the recommendations. Name, locations and

address of soil testing labs is also available on the website. However, the exact address of each lab

is not available for all districts. Soil heath card application is being used for registration of soil

samples collected.

In addition evaluation studies are also available on the public domain. Within the scheme there is

significant focus on data quality. Following information is maintained and updated on database

for ensuring quality

• List of Villages With Null Block Code

• Geo Coordinates of Samples Collected

• Incorrect Latitude And Longitude

• District wise Latitudes and Longitudes

• Incomplete Test Result Entries (District Wise)

• Incorrect Farmer Name

• Invalid Aadhar Number

• Likely Anomalous Test Results

• Duplicate Farmer Registration

In addition, information on soil health cards that are pending for printing and other relevant

information related to progress can also be accessed from the website.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Snapshot of information available on SHC pending for printing**

Source: https://soilhealth.dac.gov.in/PublicReports/RIndex

ii. Gender mainstreaming

SHC and SHM have been targeted at improvement of soil health where grids have been selected,

it does not have beneficiary oriented components or trainings. The training, demonstrations and

even soil health card are targeted towards the farming community in the specified grid of the

village. None of the activity has been targeted with specific focus on gender, however, there is no

discrimination in mission implementation.

iii. Direct / indirect employment generation

SHM does not have employment generation as one of its primary objectives. It is focused on

improvement of soil quality which can contribute to farmer’s income. Given that more than 100

million SHC have been printed in every cycle indicates the quantum and reach of the scheme.

Moreover, the process of strengthening soil testing labs and nationwide soil testing activities have

also created employment opportunities for soil testing, sample collection and field

demonstrations.

iv. Climate Change and Sustainability including Climate Change Resilient practices and

diversifications

The soil health driven initiatives take its root from successful programs in states of Karnataka and

Gujarat. Initially the National Project on Management of Soil Health & Fertility’ (NPMSH&F) was

initiated as part of NAPCC. Under this scheme, soil health cards were introduced and interventions

for strengthening of soil testing labs and expanding their testing capacity were taken up. This

evolved into the current Soil Health Management component wherein multiple other initiatives

i.e. PKVY, MOVCDNER etc. were also introduced. Soil health card and strengthening of soil testing

labs have evolved and remains an integral component of National Mission on Sustainable

Agriculture.

Given there is limited scope for increasing agricultural area, maintaining food security of highly

populous nation such as India requires interventions to improve productivity. The current

agricultural practices are severely stressing the natural resource base and contributing to decline

in soil health, water availability and quality, biodiversity, and air quality. Large area under green

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

revolution belt has also seen decline in productivity and water levels in many districts have also

dropped to critical level. Given the quantum of challenges, promotion of improved agricultural

practices can help in adapting to climate change and ensure food security^266.

Imbalanced use of chemical fertilizers have affected soil health and productivity, excess use of

nitrogen rich fertilizer which is prevalent in many Indian states have affected soil health and is

contributing towards GHG emissions. Deterioration in soil quality affects its capacity to retain

water and store carbon. For example, soils in indo-gangetic plains are severely degraded with soil

organic carbon content dropping below critical threshold. Soil health cards can promote

management of soil nutrient through scientific method which helps in maintaining soil health and

improved productivity through judicial use of fertilizers. The soil health card recommendations

also focus on increased use of vermi-compost, FYM. Bio-fertilizers are also being promoted to

reduce dependence on chemical fertilizers. The soil health cards also measure soil organic carbon

and pH value of soil to understand the nature of soil. The health card and analysis can help in

developing activities for improving fertility and reclamation of problem soils. The site and crop

specific recommendations helps in contributing towards sustainable and more climate resilient

agriculture.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the scheme

in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

There are no special incentives or provisions to ensure Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and

other weaker segments of society participation in the scheme. However, aspirational district

fellows in backward areas have been tasked to coordinate and support in progress of the scheme

in aspirational districts. The assessment in impact evaluation studies indicates that the

programme has created awareness among small and marginal farmers. It was reported that

67.4% SC/ST farmers have awareness about Soil health card. However, only 19.8% are aware

about the portal.

vi. Development, dissemination and adoption of innovative practices technology and

know-how

Crop and site-specific recommendations on balanced use of fertilizers and micro nutrients are

being provided through SHC. Awareness has been generated through media campaigns and

repeated mention about the scheme and its importance through Man Ki Baat program hosted by

Honorable Prime Minister. In addition, field demonstrations are being carried out under the

schemes, farmers on whose field demonstrations have been carried out are also being given

financial support at Rs 2500/Ha for applying recommended doses of fertilizers. Till 2018-19 more

than 3 lakh demonstrations have been carried out. On the basis of repeated feedback from

stakeholders and evaluation studies the format for SHC has been revised and the SHCs have been

developed in regional languages. There is increased focus on providing recommendations in

simplified and easy to read manner.

The SHC website also contains comprehensive database which can be used for dissemination.

State-wise soil maps have been developed on the basis of test results. Farmers from whose field

the soil sample has been taken can check the status of the SHC on the portal and get it printed

online. As SHCs are being generated in every cycle, one can access and download new and old

cards from the website.

In FY 2019-20, Model Villages Programme has been initiated on pilot basis under Soil Health Card

(SHC) Scheme. It includes adoption of one village per block for land holding based Soil Sampling,

Testing & Distribution of Soil Health Cards and subsequent SHC based demonstrations. One Fair/

Mela per village is also being organized for scaling up awareness creation amongst the farmers

across India. The database of samples collected and tested under the programme is being

maintained separately, the information about the progress and cards generated is also available

on the SHC website.

vii. Stakeholder and beneficiary behavior change

The purpose of the entire scheme is to drive change in agricultural practices of farmers by

encouraging judicious use of fertilizers. Interstate and intrastate variation in use of fertilizers has

been found by various studies. Importance of balanced use of fertilizers in maintaining soil health

and its quality is being highlighted through the scheme. The need to look beyond the commonly

accepted norm of maintaining 4:2:1 ration for NPK has been highlighted through the scheme.

Need for information dissemination about the content of cards and their relevance has been

highlighted in impact evaluation study as it was found that the contents of the card were explained

to only 44% farmers. The study further highlighted that 66% farmers reported that they are able

to understand the content of the SHC, 57% mentioned that the recommendations are suitable for

their farms and about 53% are able to follow recommendations. The interventions have helped

in reduction of DAP and Urea in Paddy and cotton cultivation, it has also promoted use of micro-

nutrients. However, as the sample are being collected from grid and not necessarily from the field

of farmer to whom the SHC is issued, there is reluctance among farmers in adapting

recommendations as they feel it is not representative of their own field. Delay in delivery of Soil

Health Cards also affects their adoption.

**_viii. Use of IT/Technology in driving efficiency_**

A mobile application has been launched for sample registration. The website of the scheme has

comprehensive database and some of its key features have been highlighted in accountability and

transparency section. IT component has multiple features which are highlighted below.

• SHC dashboard

• Year wise, state-wise, district wise, village wise farmer level information

• Soil health district maps, state and national maps

• Infographics on key parameters in collected samples e.g. NPK

• CSC dashboard for monitoring daily progress on sample collection and registration

• MIS for quality check on input data

• GPS and geo-referencing of field from where sample is being collected

• Status of soil health card, printed, printed and dispatched, sample collected but soil health

ix. Unlocking Synergies with other government programmes

The national, state and district level committees have members from line department, in addition

efforts are being taken to dovetail activities of various components under NMSA with SHC and

other schemes. In few states, fertilizer distribution has also been aligned with SHC

recommendations. MOU has been established with CSC-SPV for registration of soil sample and

printing of soil health card. Coordination has been established with KVKs, private labs through

PPP mode for soil testing and awareness generation. Nationwide awareness campaign on soil

health card has been launched for building awareness by state and central government on soil

health cards in print media, television and radio. This has helped in creating awareness about the

scheme across the country.

Issues and Challenges^267 ,^268 ,^269 ,^270 ,^271

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  Scheme has been implemented as a target oriented exercise with increased focus on sample  
    collection. Given the deficiency of infrastructure and shortage of adequate human resource,  
    it is difficult to ensure quality of recommendations.

a. Delay between sample collection and distribution of soil health card is a major

concern. During field surveys, it was highlighted that while soil samples have been

collected in villages, soil health cards are yet to be distributed. Awareness about

online portal and availability of SHC card and tracking mechanism is also found to

be lacking among farmers.

b. Slow progress in strengthening of soil testing infrastructure also affects scheme

progress.

c. While farmers are aware about the scheme many do not clearly understand the

utility and relevance of the recommendations.

d. STL in all districts do not have facilities to utilise Soil Test Crop response for

drafting recommendations.

e. Most of the labs in India analyse, pH, EC, organic carbon and NPK availability,

however, not all labs are equipped with Atomic Absorption spectrometer (AAS)

essential for micronutrient analysis. The equipment in labs are also considerably

old which affect the quality of analysis.

1.  In many states fertiliser distribution is not in-line with SHC prescription identified for the  
    state
2.  The scheme does not focus on soil reclamation, therefore we the effectiveness of  
    prescription in taking care of soil health are not tested. Poor and incomplete fertiliser  
    prescriptions and overlooking of location specific crop specific nutrient status impacts the  
    effectiveness of the prescription^272. In present soil health format focusses more on soil  
    quality and nutrients, essential ingredients of soil health such as microbial activity and  
    moisture retention ability is missing. Absence of physical^273 and microbiological indicators  
    affects the quality of prescriptions.
3.  During first two cycles samples have been collected in fixed grids of 10 Ha for rainfed area  
    and 2.5 ha for irrigated area. There is lack of clarity among experts on fixed grid approach.  
    While this helps in reaching to targeted farmers, it may affect the quality of  
    recommendations.
4.  Adequate human resources at state level for sample collection and testing is a major area of  
    concern. The mission has provisions for hiring technical resources in soil testing labs for  
    efficient operations, but the processes for hiring in states are slow because of which dearth  
    of human resources remains a cause of concern. The details of human resource requirement  
    across various states can be checked from  
    https://soilhealth.dac.gov.in/PublicReports/Manpower
5.  Availability of soil sample storage in labs is another area of concern^274.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  There is significant variation in performance of states in utilisation of funds and updating  
    data on MIS
2.  Delay in utilisation certificates from states is also an area of concern.

C. Capacity building

1.  Very few trainings and awareness generation activities have been conducted under the  
    scheme 1902 training for soil chemist, 1948 farmer training, 452 farmer mela and 80  
    workshops.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  Inadequacies in sample collection and testing was also reported as an area of concern  
    during KII.
2.  There is a gap in access to labs that can assess the status of micronutrient while soil testing.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  It happens in many areas that the land on which the sample has been collected has been  
    leased out by the owner. The lessee may not have motivation in adhering to the SHC  
    recommendation as it is not their land. This affects adoption.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions^275 ,^276

Below are the recommendations for the scheme:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  As highlighted earlier, the scheme is target oriented. KIIs revealed that the KVKs  
    operational at the field level are undertaking testing of about 150-200 samples per day for  
    issuance of soil health cards. However, as per standards about 20-25 samples per day can  
    only be dry tested for issuance of soil health cards. Therefore, many of the  
    recommendations for soil heath cards issued are similar with little variations and there is  
    need to upgrade the capacity for intended impact of interventions.
2.  In many states fertiliser distribution is not in-line with SHC prescription identified for the  
    state and therefore, policies need to be defined in-consultation with all the stakeholders.
3.  Reclamation of problem soil is not yet covered under the scheme since focus is on providing  
    prescription. The effectiveness of the prescription needs to be tested.
4.  Issues highlighted related to soil health card prescription, soil health, inadequacy of soil  
    sample storage, delay between sample collection, testing and distribution of SHC, quality of  
    recommendations, Human resource, awareness, clarity on sample collection methodology  
    and encouraging adoption of methodology needs to be taken addressed to ensure desired  
    impact of interventions

o For a more comprehensive and useful analysis, block-wise soil variogram needs

to be developed. The number of grids from which sample should be taken can be

identified based on the variation in soil at block level.

Efficient Nutrient Management for Improving Soil Health, September 28-29, 2015, New Delhi, India, TAAS, ICAR, CIMMYT, IPNI, CSISA,  
FAI, p. 56.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

o Poor mass acceptability of soil testing services is a concern, hence, there is a need

to establish fully automated soil testing labs with trained human resources.

o Coverage of soil health card with assessment of Micronutrients also needs to be

addressed, as only 30% of SHC contains information on micro-nutrients.

o Time of application of fertilisers and method of application is very important,

these aspects are not covered in the SHC and are suggested to be included.

1.  Financial support for implementing recommendations for demonstration may be increased  
    from Rs 2500/Ha, particularly for horticultural crops which require more investment
2.  Linkages of Soil Test Labs with research institutions like ICAR and State Agriculture  
    Universities need to be strengthened to improve the quality of services
3.  Private sector participation may be encouraged for setting up of labs/ running operations  
    of existing labs with strict SLAs in-place for quality which can lead to greater impact at a  
    faster pace.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  There is significant variation in performance of states in utilisation of funds and updating  
    data on MIS, states like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have performed well, while states  
    like Punjab, Assam, West Bengal and Bihar need to improve their processes and  
    performance. There is need for continuous engagement with states lagging in their  
    performance.
2.  Delay in utilisation certificates from states is also an area of concern. The latest information  
    on status on unutilised funds should be periodically updated on the website.
3.  Price fixed for analysis and collection of each sample can be relooked at as the market rates  
    vary. The quality of recommendations by private labs should also be monitored.

C. Capacity building

1.  Very few trainings and awareness generation activities have been conducted under the  
    scheme, considering the scheme targets farmers across country these activities need to be  
    encouraged.
2.  Interventions on strengthening bio-fertiliser production units under the scheme need to be  
    promoted.
3.  Soil health card can be promoted with other trainings/ areas such as integrated pest  
    management, good agriculture practices, alternative crops, water requirement, time of  
    sowing and suitable time for application of fertilisers.
4.  While issues on data quality are being addressed. There is need to enhance quality of  
    recommendations by deploying trained technical staff and better equipment that can  
    provide assessment of soil organic carbon, micro-nutrients etc. The utility of  
    recommendations also needs to be explained to farmers.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  Inadequacies in sample collection and testing was also reported as an area of concern  
    during KII. Process from sample collection to storage needs to be monitored and supervised

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

by technical experts. The concerns of the farmers regarding sample collection method

should be addressed at the time of sample collection.

1.  Focus should be on upgradation of labs instead of number tests as quality of  
    recommendation is very important. More labs should be updated with latest equipment and  
    trained staff for assessing micro-nutrients.
2.  Extension and awareness generation should be conducted for lease holder and farm  
    owners, the lease holders can apprised on benefits of SHC in improving productivity and  
    reducing cost of cultivation. This will encourage them to adopt better practices.
3.  The focus of the scheme is more on issuing SHCs, it is important to assess impact of scheme  
    in terms of adoption of recommendations by farmers and impact of recommendations on  
    overall productivity of crop and soil health still needs to be assessed.
4.  The output-outcome framework primarily focusses on number of samples collected and  
    number of soil health cards issued. There is need to include some of the qualitative  
    indicators such as number of farmers who have adopted recommendations, improvement  
    in production/ productivity from adoption of recommendations, time taken from collection  
    of sample to issuance of soil health card, etc.
5.  Recently introduced model village programme needs to be monitored closely to see its  
    impact, the differences observed in project and control needs to be examined.

E. Convergence with other schemes and programs

1.  Identified areas with problem soil can be targeted and convergence can be established with  
    other schemes for their treatment, successful treatment of problem soil based on the SHC  
    recommendations can serve as an example and good practices for others to emulate.

Key Inputs from Previous Evaluation of the Scheme :

Impact study on soil health card scheme conducted by MANAGE raised concerns about

• Poor adoption of recommendations

• Quality of recommendations

• Focus on achieving numbers and inadequacy of infrastructure

• Limited demonstration and awareness among farmers

• Delay in sample collection and distribution of SHC

• Lack of clarity in sample collection mythology

• Lack of trained and qualified staff etc

• It also recommended the use of soil variogram

A model village programme has been launched that adopts a different approach for

collection and testing. It also focuses on demonstrating the impact of recommendations

among farmers to increase adoption. The format of soil health card has also been

reviewed and revised. However, the focus of scheme still remains on achieving numbers.

Lot needs to be done to upgrade STL infrastructure in India and maintain quality of

recommendations under SHC. Finer aspects of soil health including presence of micro-

organisms and moisture content also needs to be brought into scheme design.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

This is an important scheme as soil health and sustaining its health is essential

sustainable agriculture. The scheme has revolutionised soil testing in India and is

aiming to input use efficiency by encouraging balanced use of fertilisers as per the

requirement of crop and soil health.

Given its importance of the scheme, it needs to be continued with minor changes under

NMSA. It needs to focus on creating soil testing infrastructure and improving the

effectiveness of soil health card recommendations.

The targets and achievements on output and outcome indicators are not available for the scheme

in public domain.

NPOF being subsumed under SHM has the same cross-thematic assessment applicable as SHM.

Issues and Challenges^284

1.  The NPOF has been implemented under NMSA. No proposals have been received for  
    financial assistance under Capital Investment Subsidy Scheme (CISS) in last two years.
2.  No research proposal for R&D of organic package of practices specific to State and  
    cropping system or any proposal for setting up of a separate Organic Agriculture Research  
    and Teaching institute have been received.
3.  The unspent balance with NABARD remains a concern and BE for 2020-21 has been  
    reduced for the same.

Recommendations and Solutions

1.  The doubling farmer income’s report volume- 7 states that “ _The quality control of bio-_  
    _agents is also very pivotal for sustainable use of such products and creation of confidence_  
    _among the farming community. Capacity building programs are organized at NIPHM, but_  
    _the implementation of production of inputs by trained persons is very shallow”._ In light of  
    this, the primary focus must be on quality control and production management. The  
    central government needs to promote research and studies for developing standards and  
    protocols for organic fertilizers and bio-pesticides, and conducting field trials and  
    demonstrations. It can also establish few facilities itself monitor the production and check  
    its efficacy.
2.  Time-tested interventions like production of phosphate rich organic manure as biogas  
    slurry, green manuring and utilization of crop residue can be promoted for organic  
    cultivation and their impact can be measured through field trials.
3.  The scheme may be revamped based on field trials and clear deliverables defined for  
    achievement during the scheme period.

2.2.12 Sub-Mission on Seed and Planting Material

Background of the Scheme

A Central Sector Scheme ‘Development and Strengthening of Infrastructure Facilities for

Production and Distribution of Quality Seeds’ was being implemented from the year 2005- 06

aiming at ensuring production and multiplication of high yielding certified/quality seeds of all

crops and making them available to the farmers. Although the scheme contributed in doubling the

availability of quality seeds in the country during the last 5 years, a need was felt to upgrade and

expand the existing scheme into a Mission mode in order to include new/emerging technologies

in production of quality/certified seeds, improve seed testing laboratories, support seed

producing agencies in adopting new seed producing technologies etc.

Accordingly, during the 12th Plan, a Sub-Mission for Seed and Planting Material (SMSP) under

National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology (NMAET) was launched. SMSP aims

to increase production of certified / quality seed, to upgrade the quality of farm saved seeds, to

strengthen the seed multiplication chain, to promote new technologies and methodologies in seed

production, processing, testing etc., to strengthen and modernize infrastructure for seed

production, storage, certification, quality etc.

Some of the components under the SMSP are existing/ upgraded version of ongoing schemes with

100% Government of India Share. New components have been added mostly with 75% Central:

25% State share.

**Objectives of the Mission**^285

• Increasing production of certified/ quality seed

• Increasing Seed Replacement Ration (SRR) more particularly to achieve higher SRR in

crops like paddy, gram, groundnut, cotton etc.

• Upgrading the quality of farm saved seeds with specific objective to cover 10% villages

and produce 100 lakh quintals of seed each year through farmers participatory seed

production.

• Encouraging seed treatment particularly for farm saved seed.

• Strengthening the seed multiplication chain through assistance to public and private

sector.

• Popularizing new varieties to encourage varietal replacement.

• Promoting new technologies and methodologies in seed production, processing, testing

etc.

• Strengthening and modernizing infrastructure for seed production, storage, certification

and quality control particularly to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Seeds

Bill 2004/ISTA standards, OECD certification.

• Facilitating movement of seed from India in international trade and increase its share to

10% by 2020 as envisaged in the new policy on seed development.

**Implementation structure and stakeholders**

At the national level, the Mission structure comprises of a General Council under the

Chairpersonship of Agriculture Minister, an Executive Committee for Seeds (ECS) under the

Chairpersonship of the Secretary (DAC) and a Sub-Mission Monitoring Committee (SMMC) with

Joint Secretary (Seeds) as the Director (SMSP). At the State level, the State Level Seed Mission

Executive Committee is constituted under the Chairmanship of Agriculture Production

Commissioner (APC)/Principal Secretary (Agriculture) or Secretary (Agriculture) of the

concerned State with the representatives from other concerned Departments and stake holders.

Appropriate structures are created at the district level as per need. Project Management Teams

are constituted at the National Level and State Level. The State Government designates a suitable

Nodal agency for implementation and coordination among different Departments/ agencies.

However, central agencies like NSC, SFCI, ICAR institutes, etc. are funded directly by the

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture or through the Central Agency

as decided by ECS.

The Executive Committee on Seeds oversees the activities of the Mission and approves the State

Seed Plans. ECS is empowered to approve projects on the basis of the approved norms. ECS shall

meet every half yearly. Annual Action Plans of States/ Implementing Agencies are to be approved

by the ECS. The ECS also decides the allocation of funds to the States/ Implementing Agencies

based on the approved Annual Action Plan. The release of funds shall be done by the DAC and

routed through respective State Governments, which may transfer funds to designated

implementing agencies alongwith the State share of funds.

Sub-Mission Monitoring Committee (SMMC)

The Sub-Mission Monitoring Committee (SMMC) under the Chairmanship of JS (Seeds) monitors

the implementation of SMSP. SMMC is assisted by technical experts appointed on contractual

basis for implementation of the Sub-Mission. It will have the responsibility to ensure collaboration

among various line departments in the Centre/State to achieve the targets.

A State Level Seed Mission - Executive Committee (SLEC) is constituted by the State Government

under the Chairpersonship of the Agricultural Production Commissioner/ Principal

Secretary/Secretary (Agriculture) having representatives from other concerned Departments

and stakeholders for planning and overseeing the implementation of the programmes. The

Committee shall meet at least once in every quarter.

**Intended contribution to sectoral performance**

India is home to 1.2 billion people. India’s population is expected to grow to 1.8 billion before

stabilizing around the middle of this century, if sufficient measures are taken. While the country

lays claim of being self-sufficient in food production, it still ranks 103rd in Global Hunger Index of

119 countries. It is important for the country to thus increase production of food crops further.

This is challenging given that the number of agricultural workers is on a decline due to

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

urbanisation – the percentage of agricultural workers in total workers has declined from 69.7%

in 1951 to 54.6% in 2011^286.

The Sub Mission on Seed and Planting Material thus aims to ensure production and multiplication

of high yielding certified/quality seeds of all crops and making them available to the farmers. In

order to further boost production, the Mission also aims to include new/emerging technologies

in production of quality/certified seeds, improve seed testing laboratories, and support seed

producing agencies in adopting new seed producing technologies.

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

The scheme concurs with the National Agenda of Doubling Farmers Income as it seeks to facilitate

movement of seed and planting material from India in international trade and increase its share

to 10% by 2020 as envisaged in the new policy on seed development. The scheme also seeks to

Double Farmers’ Income through Modernizing Agriculture. It aims to attain this by popularizing

new varieties of seed and plant material to encourage varietal replacement and new technologies

and methodologies in seed production, processing, testing etc.

The Mission aligns with the UN SDGs as well. The scheme focusses on SDG 2, viz., End hunger,

achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. UN SDG target

2.5 aims to maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, including through soundly managed and

diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels. The scheme

seeks to achieve this through increase in the production of certified/ quality seed and encourage

seed treatment. It also enables strengthening and modernization of infrastructure for seed

production, storage, certification and quality control. This will help in facilitating movement of

seed from India in international trade, hence aiding genetic diversity of seeds. The other SDGs for

the scheme have been mentioned below.

**Observations:**

• Breeder seed production has increased significantly to 99,671 MT in 2018-19 (against

10,508 MT in 2017-18).

• However, there has been some dip in production of foundation seeds.

• The target of seeds maintained under NSR had been missed in 2016 - 17 and 2017-18, but

the targets were achieved in 2018-19.

• There has been a significant increase in the number of seed villages in 2017-18. Our KII

discussions that the target for number of seed villages was 60,000 – this has been over-

achieved.

− This has also resulted in an increase in number of seeds produced, and the number of

farmers benefitted.

Progress on Outputs and Outcomes was not available for SMSP.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• Sub Mission on Seed and Planting Material aims to ensure production and multiplication

of high yielding certified/quality seeds of all crops and making them available to the

farmers. In order to further boost production, the Mission also aims to include

new/emerging technologies in production of quality/certified seeds, improve seed testing

laboratories, and support seed producing agencies in adopting new seed producing

technologies.

• The scheme concurs with the National Agenda of Doubling Farmers Income as it seeks to

facilitate movement of seed and planting material from India in international trade and

increase its share to 10% by 2020 as envisaged in the new policy on seed development.

**Effectiveness**

• Breeder seed production has increased significantly to 99,671 MT in 2018-19 (against

10,508 MT in 2017-18). However, there has been some dip in production of foundation

seeds.

• The target of seeds maintained under NSR had been missed in 2016-17 and 2017-18, but

the targets were achieved in 2018-19. Also, there has been a significant increase in the

number of seed villages in 2017-18.

• The progress on outputs and outcomes is not available for the scheme which needs to be

monitored for assessment of effectiveness of interventions.

**Efficiency**

• The financial utilization in 2016-17 and 2017-18 has been satisfactory and the budgeted

estimates for the scheme has been increasing.

• State-wise allocation has risen except in 2015-16. However, data on utilization by states

is not available.

**Sustainability**

• For components related to infrastructure, geo-tagging of physical assets is not being done.

Geo-tagging can help in better tracking and monitoring of scheme progress with respect

to asset creation. It can also help in enabling traceability and aid certification.

**Equity**

• There is no separate allocation of funds for inclusion of women farmers. Special provisions

may be made within the scheme along with targets to cover women and other vulnerable

social groups under the scheme interventions. The capacity building component should

specifically focus on aspects of gender mainstreaming.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas

i. Accountability and Transparency

At the national level, the Mission structure comprises of a General Council, an Executive

Committee for Seeds (ECS) and a Sub-Mission Monitoring Committee (SMMC). At the State level,

the State Level Seed Mission Executive Committee is constituted under the Chairmanship of

Agriculture Production Commissioner (APC)/Principal Secretary (Agriculture) or Secretary

(Agriculture) of the concerned State with the representatives from other concerned Departments

and stakeholders. Appropriate structures are created at the district level as per need. Project

Management Teams are constituted at the National Level and State Level. The State Government

designates a suitable Nodal agency for implementation and coordination among different

Departments/ agencies. The nodal structures at national, state, and district level ensure robust

accountability mechanism, with a fair visibility at all these levels. The Mission has 14

interventions, many of which have further sub-interventions. Owing to the multiplicity of

interventions, multiple officers are given charge of few of these components. Our discussions

indicated that the officers at the Ministry level are working in silos and do not hence have a

complete visibility of the scheme. In regards to transparency, the availability of scheme data on

public domain is fairly limited. Data on statistics is captured on Seednet India portal.

Figure 167 : Snapshot of Seednet India portal

Source: Seednet India portal

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The Sub-Mission has a nodal structure at national, state, and district level for monitoring

and implementing the scheme. Project Management Teams are constituted at the National

Level and State Level. The State Government designates a suitable Nodal agency for

implementation and coordination among different Departments/ agencies.

• The Mission has 14 interventions, hence, multiple officers are in-charge of various

interventions in the scheme.

• Our discussions indicated that the officers at the Ministry level are working in silos and

do not hence have a complete visibility of the scheme.

• The availability of scheme data on public domain is limited to the scheme guidelines, and

some data available in the DAC&FW annual report.

• Data on year-wise allocation and release of funds, seed requirement and availability,

number of beneficiaries, number of seed varieties notified, etc. are available on Seednet

India portal. Data on seed statistics on the portal, however, is not updated.

• No beneficiary-level data is available in the public domain.

• Regular baseline surveys, mid-term evaluations, and impact evaluation studies are inbuilt

in the scheme. However, the same are not available on public domain.

• No social audit has been done for the Mission

• Close monitoring of the physical and the financial targets of various program

interventions is done by the SMMC. At the State level, the activities of the Mission are

monitored by a Committee constituted under the Chairmanship of the State Mission

Director with members from the line Departments, SAUs, lead banks, ICAR institutes etc.

• In terms of funding, some of the components under the scheme are 100% government

funded, while some have 75:25 Central to State assistance, support to R&D intervention

has 60:40 Central to State assistance, and PPP intervention has 50:50 Central to State

assistance.

• The Executive Committee on Seeds decides the allocation of funds to the

states/implementing agencies based on the approved Annual Action Plans. The release of

funds is done by DAC, and routed through respective state governments, which may

transfer funds to designated implementing agencies along with state share of funds.

• DBT is used in the scheme.

ii. Direct/Indirect employment generation

The implementation of SMSP is expected to generate direct and indirect employment

opportunities for skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled manpower. Creation of infrastructure for

seed storage, Grow-Out Test farm, seed farms, seed processing plant, and National Seed Reserve

would lead to increase in employment. Additionally, a seed village, wherein trained group of

farmers are involved in production of seeds of various crops generates employment for these

farmers. Indirect employment is also created in a seed village as more raw material and

technology is procured for seed development and maintenance.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• No data is available for the quantum of employment generated through the scheme.

• However, since the scheme seeks to create lot of infrastructure for seed storage, Grow-

Out Test farm, seed farms, seed processing plant, and National Seed Reserve, there is huge

potential for employment generation, both directly and indirectly.

• Direct employment is generated for workers at storage plants, seed treatment plants, seed

banks, scientists and other staff at seed certification agencies, etc.

• Indirect employment is generated for transporters, warehouse agents, trainers (who

coach farmers at seed villages, and directly at beneficiary level)

• No assistance is provided in the scheme through Mudra.

• The scope for self-employment in the scheme is less, as per the KII discussions.

iii. Gender Mainstreaming

There is no separate allocation of funds under the various components/ schemes of Seeds Division

for women farmers. However, implementing agencies/ States have been requested to allocate

adequate funds for participation of women farmers in Seed Village Programme.

iv. Role of TSP and SCSP

The Mission does not differentiate among any category of farmers, however, no specific activities for  
encouraging their participation have been rolled out.

v. Use of IT/Technology in driving efficiency

The Mission leverages technology in multiple interventions, including seed village, seed testing

laboratories, variety purity testing, seed treatment drums, and application of biotechnology in

agriculture, etc. The mission also has a central database portal, Seednet India portal, which houses

information on seed sector in India, quality control, seed replacement rate, seed multiplication

ratio, breeder seeds, foundation seeds, certified seeds, etc. It also captures data on year-wise

allocation and release of funds, seed requirement and availability, number of beneficiaries,

number of seed varieties notified, etc.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• Information Communication Technology (ICT) is used for monitoring and evaluation of

the Mission.

• The Mission offers assistance for establishment of new tissue culture lab and assistance

for rehabilitation/ strengthening of old tissue culture Labs, to promote biotechnology in

agriculture.

• The scheme encourages adoption of new seed producing technologies.

• The Seednet India portal helps in monitoring of the mission progress. Data on seed

statistics on the portal, however, is not updated.

• No information was available on the frequency of update on the portal.

• No geo-tagging is done in the scheme for infrastructural assets.

vi. Development, dissemination & adoption of innovative practices

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

There have no funds earmarked for development, dissemination & adoption of innovative

practices. Moreover, no applications are being used for this purpose.

vii. Research & Development

Research and development is an important component under the Mission. Collaboration has also

been made with ICAR and SAUs for research support. The National Seed Research and Training

Centre (NSRTC), Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh) has been functioning since October 2005 and has been

notified as Central Seed Testing and Referral Laboratory (CSTL) with effect from 01.04.2007. The

objective of CSTL, NSRTC is to maintain uniformity in seed testing and to ensure supply of quality

seeds at National level. It also acts as Referral Laboratory under Court of Law for seed related

issues. NSRTC is a premiere institute for capacity building in relation to maintaining Seed Quality

Assurance. During 2018-19 (till 15th January, 2019) NSRTC had organized 8 National Training

Programme on various seed related issues for the benefit of various stakeholders of Govt., Public

and Private Sector etc.

**_viii. Unlocking synergies_**

To fulfil the obligations under Article 27(3)(b) of Trade Related Aspects of the Intellectual

Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which has been

ratified by India, the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Govt. of India enacted

Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act (PPV&FR Act), which provides for the

establishment of an effective system for Protection of Plant Varieties, the Rights of Farmers and

Plant Breeders and to encourage the development of new varieties of plants. The PPV&FR Act is

one of the interventions under the Mission. It intends to stimulate investment for research and

development, both in public and private sector for development of new varieties for accelerated

agricultural development in the country. The Act also facilitates the growth of the seed industry

to ensure availability of high quality seeds of new varieties to farmers.

ix. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives (e.g.

Farmer cooperatives, FPOs, Water User Associations, etc.) and civil society in the

scheme

Two of the Mission targets center arouns involvement of private sector players, viz., _Strengthening_

_the seed multiplication chain through assistance to public and private Sector_ , and _Assisting and_

_supporting public and private seed producing organizations in seed sector and encouraging_

_partnerships_. A unique feature of the the Mission is that it offers training on seed related activities

to private sector as well. It also promotes PPP in the sector.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The Mission seeks to bolster seed multiplication through assistance to private sector.

• It also seeks to support private seed producing organizations in the sector.

• So far, 605 such projects have been sanctioned for the small entrepreneurs in 17 States

with 143.11 lakh quintals. Seed processing capacity and storage capacity of 51.27 lakh

quintals as on 31.10.2018^287.

• A unique feature of the the Mission is that it offers training on seed related activities to

private sector as well.

(^287) Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Annual Report 2018- 19

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• It encourages PPP in the seed sector - Partnership arrangements will be based on an

agreement prescribed by the Department/ Sub-Mission of Seed & Planting Material, and

signed by both parties.

• Private Companies, individual entrepreneurs, self-help groups, seed co-operatives and

partnership firms are eligible for subsidy for creation of infrastructure facilities relating

to seed cleaning, grading, processing, seed treating, packaging and storage units as well as

for seed testing facilities including R&D.

− Credit linked back ended subsidy is enhanced @40% of the capital cost of the project

in general areas and 50% in case of hilly and scheduled areas subject to an upper limit

of Rs 150 lakhs per project

− Assistance is also available for R&D by private sector players.

Discussion on Sector specific thematic assessment

The scheme focusses on production of certified/quality seeds to ensure high yields. While the

scheme has an intervention for attracting private sector, there is tremendous potential for

encouraging start-ups in the scheme. This is so because start-ups tend to be more risk-taking and

tech-savvy. They may be able to experiment with newer technologies and produce better, more

resilient and high-yielding variety of seeds. A number of agri-tech start-ups have are coming up

in India – of the 56,000 start-ups in India, 450 are in the agri-tech space^288. Encouraging star-ups

and incubators may be beneficial for the sector’s growth.

The scheme should also focus on developing linkages with food processing industries. This is so

because processing of crops derived from certified/quality seeds can result in superior products

for sale in the market. This would enable farmers to receive remunerative prices for their

products.

Issues and Challenges

Some of the major issues and challenges in the scheme are as follows:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  At the national level, the Mission structure comprises of a General Council, an Executive  
    Committee for Seeds (ECS) and a Sub-Mission Monitoring Committee (SMMC). At the State  
    level, the State Level Seed Mission Executive Committee is constituted under the  
    Chairmanship of Agriculture Production Commissioner (APC)/Principal Secretary  
    (Agriculture) or Secretary (Agriculture) of the concerned State with the representatives  
    from other concerned Departments and stakeholders. Appropriate structures are created  
    at the district level as per need. Project Management Teams are constituted at the National  
    Level and State Level. The State Government designates a suitable Nodal agency for  
    implementation and coordination among different Departments/ agencies. While the  
    multiplicity of agencies ensures a robust implementation structure, the existence of  
    multiple agencies slows down decision-making and hinders fast-tracking of critical  
    projects. Typically, such a scenario would lead to delay in starting of projects and  
    consequent delay in disbursement of funds. By the time the funds are released, there may

(^288) NASSCOM, Agritech in India – Emerging trends in 2019, August 2019

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

also be a rise in raw material and project cost, rendering the whole mechanism less fruitful.

This also adds to the administrative work as reporting is to be done at all these levels.

1.  The Mission has 14 interventions, many of which have further sub-interventions. Owing to  
    the multiplicity of interventions, multiple officers are given charge of few of these  
    components. Our discussions indicated that the officers at the Ministry level are working in  
    silos and do not hence have a complete visibility of the scheme.
2.  There is no separate allocation of funds for inclusion of women farmers.
3.  For components related to infrastructure, geo-tagging of physical assets is not being done.

B. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  Close monitoring of the physical and the financial targets of various program interventions  
    is done by the Sub-Mission Monitoring Committee (SMMC). SMMC is assisted by technical  
    experts appointed on contractual basis for implementation of the Sub-Mission. It has the  
    responsibility to ensure collaboration among various line departments in the Centre/State  
    to achieve the targets. The Mission also hires contractual manpower for technical services  
    and database development, etc. The appointment of technical manpower is also made on  
    contractual basis. Since a majority of staff is on contractual basis, there are chances of  
    discontinuity in monitoring. The recently joined staff may not have sufficient knowledge of  
    the Mission, and may hence miss critical gaps in scheme implementation.
2.  An important aspect of monitoring as specified in the guidelines is regular update of data  
    by the State Level Executive Committee (SLEC) on the portal. However, some of the  
    information on the portal (Seednet India), is quite outdated and has not been updated in  
    the past few years, making it difficult for Ministry officials to monitor on-ground progress  
    frequently.
3.  Further, while regular baseline surveys, mid-term evaluations, and impact evaluation  
    studies are inbuilt in the Mission, the reports are not available on public domain.
4.  Although many of the Mission interventions focus on creation of infrastructural facilities,  
    viz., Seed Village, National Seed Reserve, Seed processing facilities, Seed storage facilities,  
    etc., the scheme does not encourage geo-tagging of these facilities. Our discussions  
    highlighted that this is due to inadequate budget for geo-tagging.

C. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  In terms of funding, some of the components under the scheme are 100% government  
    funded, while some have 75:25 Central to State assistance, support to R&D intervention  
    has 60:40 Central to State assistance, and PPP intervention has 50:50 Central to State  
    assistance. The Executive Committee on Seeds (ECS) decides the allocation of funds to the  
    states/implementing agencies based on the approved Annual Action Plans. The release of  
    funds is done by DAC, and routed through respective state governments, which may  
    transfer funds to designated implementing agencies along with state share of funds.
2.  Our KII discussions highlighted that in-kind benefit transfer in the Mission has not  
    achieved desirable success. This is so because the provision of certified seeds to  
    beneficiaries comes with considerable administrative costs as well as leakages. KIIs  
    further highlighted that there have also been instances wherein DBT is not being  
    transferred as mandated by the GoI norms. For example, ideally, farmers should pay the

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

non-subsidised price to purchase seeds from the retailers, and receive the subsidy amount

directly in their bank account after each purchase. However, it has been noted that

implementing agencies are transferring the amount in farmers’ account after deducting

subsidy amount. If a seed costs Rs. 100, and has a subsidy of 50%, instead of paying the

full amount of Rs. 100 to retailer and then receiving Rs. 50 from implementing agency,

farmers are receiving Rs. 50 into their account (wherein they may or may not have

incurred Rs. 100). In addition to not meeting GoI norms, this leaves potential for leakages

in the scheme.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the recommendations for the scheme:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The guidelines of the scheme can be simplified to bring in more efficiency in  
    implementation. It will help in faster project approval, disbursal and utilization of funds
2.  Inter-scheme convergence needs to be established, monthly meetings to monitor the  
    progress of the scheme can help in establishing better convergence across all stakeholders  
    in scheme.
3.  Special provisions may be made within the scheme along with targets to cover women  
    and other vulnerable social groups under the scheme interventions. The capacity building  
    component should specifically focus on aspects of gender mainstreaming.
4.  Geo-tagging can help in better tracking and monitoring of scheme progress with respect  
    to asset creation. It can also help in enabling traceability and aid certification.
5.  Traceability along seed value chain is another important aspect, particularly, to protect  
    the income loss incurred by farmer due to use of spurious and low quality seeds. Thus,  
    scheme intervention should facilitate development of technology based solutions for  
    building seed traceability mechanism / systems. Private sector partnerships may be  
    encouraged for the same. For example, recently the Government of Punjab has announced  
    an initiative related to Seed Potato Traceability and Certification to protect the interest of  
    the potato seed growers in the state. For the purpose, the state government has also roped  
    in private sector firm to leverage use of AI technology.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

B. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  To avoid discontinuity of staff, the recruitment can be done for a fixed term of three year  
    with fixed appraisal for each year, subject to desirable performance.
2.  The seednet portals needs to be updated regularly to ensure regular monitoring. This is  
    necessary for effective monitoring.
3.  The monitoring and evaluation reports if available should also be uploaded on public  
    domain.
4.  The need for funding for geo-tagging of the scheme and should be communicated by the  
    implementation agencies to the department, the funds may be released after assessment  
    of requirement.
5.  The Sub-Mission has 14 interventions, many of which have further sub-interventions. The  
    IT based MIS / online portal should be strengthened to facilitate efficient tracking  
    scheme’s performance. Besides, data availability on the portal, statistical information  
    related to seeds should be updated regularly. Other information such as beneficiary level  
    data (gender disaggregated), outcome analysis of baseline surveys, evaluation and impact  
    reports etc. being critical need to be monitored and made available in public domain/  
    updated at the portal.
6.  The scheme objectives focus on aspects from seed production to processing to storage and  
    marketing. However, the output/ outcome indicators do not seem to be fully cover the  
    objectives of the scheme. Some key output indicators that may be included in the  
    framework –

o Numbers of farmers trained (with gender disaggregation)

o Percentage of farmers involved and area planted to improved seeds

o Number of farmers engaged in quality seed production, marketing and sales

o Increase in production of breeder and foundation seed of improved varieties

o Increase in import/ export of seeds

o Increase in investment by private sector in seed value chain etc.

1.  Similarly, the outcome indicator should also measure the increase in varietal diversity,  
    additional income and employment generation achieved through project interventions.

C. Capacity building

1.  One of the scheme objectives is to facilitate export of seeds from India. Export of seeds  
    may particularly be targeted in ASEAN countries, particularly the SAARC nations  
    (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka),  
    where the adaptability conditions for Indian varieties are almost similar. In this context,  
    the scheme may extend support to undertake export-oriented market research and  
    studies to assess the trade potential and market access. Besides, the capacity building  
    components may also focus on training of the farmer on export oriented seed cultivation.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

The scheme is part of National Mission on Agriculture Extension and Technology, it is

an important scheme, as seed and planting materials are critical inputs for agriculture

and horticultural production.

The scheme plays an important role in development and strengthening of infrastructure

facilities for production and distribution of quality seeds’ and is critical for the success

for the other schemes i.e. NFSM etc. it should therefore be continued. However , minor

changes including, improved governance, monitoring and focus on all scheme

components is required for achieving desired outcomes

2.2.13 Rainfed Area Development

Background of the Scheme

Rainfed Area Development (RAD) is a component of NMSA since 2014-15. RAD adopts an area

based approach for development and conservation of natural resources along with farming

systems. It was formulated on ‘watershed plus framework’ to explore potential utilization of

natural resources developed through watershed development and soil conservation

activities/interventions. It aims to promote integrated farming systems by focusing on multi-

cropping, crop rotation and allied activities like livestock, apiculture etc. Integrated farming

systems helps in minimizing adverse impact of crop failure through diversified systems.

**Implementation structure and stakeholders**

RAD follows the implementation structure of NMSA. It has a three tier structure. At national level

a National Advisory Committee (NAC) under Chairmanship of Secretary (A&C) is responsible for

providing strategic direction and guidance for planning. The committee has members from all

divisions of Agriculture department as well as members from Ministries of Rural development,

environment, land resources, water resources, tribal affairs etc.

A Project Sanctioning Committee (PSC) chaired by Mission Director, NMSA is responsible for

prioritizing and approving projects. It has representation from Indian Council of Agriculture

Research (ICAR), Department of Land Resources (DoLR), Ministry Water Resources (MoWR),

Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA), Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF), Dept. of Animal

Husbandry, Dairy & Fisheries (DAHD&F), INM & NHM Divisions of DAC. The PSC is serviced by

Natural Resource Management (NRM) and Rain-fed Farming System (RFS) Divisions of DAC. The

proposals for reclamation of problem soils may be made under RAD components. The proposals

on SHM components are approved by INM Division of DAC. The implementation is supported by

(^289) https://nmsa.dac.gov.in/pdfdoc/NMSA\_Guidelines\_English.pdf last accessed on 26th December  
2019

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

standing technical committee, climate change cell and subordinate institutions of department of

agriculture.

RAD is being coordinated by Rainfed Area system division of Ministry - the division takes care of

PMKSY-PDMC and RAD. During preparation of planning phase and allocation, efforts are made to

dovetail activities of PMKSY-PDMC and RAD.

At State level, there is a State Level Committee (SLC) chaired by Agriculture Production

Commissioner (APC)/Principal Secretary/Secretary (Agriculture/Horticulture) with

representation from concerned line Departments like Revenue, Animal Husbandry, Fisheries,

Forests etc., CEO of SLNA, SAUs and ICAR Centres oversee planning and implementation of the

Mission. The committees are supported by technical experts and consultants. At district level

there is provision of a District Mission Committee (DMC) which is responsible for project

formulation, implementation and monitoring of NMSA. DMC may be headed by Collector or CEO

of Zilla Parishad /District Council with representatives from concerned line Departments

including animal husbandry, horticulture, fishery, rural development, forest etc. and ATMA, KVK,

Growers’ Associations, Marketing Boards, Banks, Non-Government Organizations etc. Dy.

Director (Agriculture) is generally the Member Secretary of the District Mission Committee.

**Intended contribution to sectoral challenges**

With increasing, climatic variation, fluctuation in rainfall, increasing temperature and reducing

ground water table agriculture is becoming more vulnerable. Therefore, it is important to

diversify agricultural activities especially in rainfed farming system. Integrated farming and

diversified agriculture system helps in reduced dependence on single crop and diversify risks.

Diversification makes agriculture more resilient and helps in adaptation to climate variations. As

more than 50% of the gross cropped area in India is rainfed importance of interventions specific

to development of rainfed areas become more important. Rainfed area development is an

important component of NMSA which aims to encourage diversified integrated farming in rainfed

areas. RAD encourages cluster based approach and promotes an integrated approach which

promotes integrate nutrient management, soil health, diversified farming, post-harvest

interventions and marketing. Within RAD there is significant stress on Dairy, poultry,

horticulture, fisheries and agroforestry activities.

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

The scheme through its components contributes directly towards national development

objectives of doubling farmer’s income, employment generation and entrepreneurship

development. NITI Aayog’s ‘Strategy for New India @ 75’ has outlined doubling farmers’ income

as priority area for national development. Diversification helps in contributing towards improved

income by making agriculture climate resilient In addition the scheme also contribute towards

attaining targets under following SDGs:

Goal 1: No poverty- Scheme is essentially supporting rainfed areas with focus on small and

marginal farmers. Integrated farming system and diversified activities helps in reducing risks

and can contribute towards a sustained income

Goal 2: Zero Hunger- Diversification aids in efficient utilisation of resources and provides

multiple source of nutrition i.e. agriculture crops, horticulture crops, dairying and fisheries

Goal 6: By promoting organic cultivation to reduce the use of chemical fertilisers

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Goal 13: Climate action-This is a part of National mission on sustainable agriculture and is

targeted at rain-fed area development

Goal 17: Partnership for goals are being created through this programme by establishing

convergence with other schemes such as PMKSY, MIDH etc

interventions (20.27% horticulture based, 40.84% dairy based 13.64% small ruminant poultry

based, 2% fisheries based) and 13.33% on cropping systems with peripheral plantations. Tamil

Nadu and UP received highest funding under the scheme. Other states that received substantial

funds are Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. It is important to note that

large rainfed states such as Rajasthan has not received funds since 2015-16.

Target Achievement

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Overall, the programme has achieved 75% of its physical targets^293 from 2014-2019. The

programme is declining in terms of percentage of overall physical achievement, which was

highest at 89% in 2014-15. This has consistently dropped to 69% in 2018-19. One of the primary

reasons highlighted for this decline is the increasing costs for undertaking activities. While the

cost required for undertaking activities has increased in recent years the cost norms under the

scheme has remained unchanged, this affects the performance and leads to non- achievement of

targets. In addition, interstate variation in involvement also affect mission progress.

Between April 2014 and March 2019, Tamil Nadu constitutes for more than 31% of physical

targets and 40% of overall physical achievements under RDA. Tamil Nadu has successfully

covered 95,307 Ha of the targeted 103815 Ha area (92% achievement). TN is followed by UP

which accounts for 34484 hectares (14.6%) of the overall area covered with 87% achievement of

overall target. This is followed by Odisha which accounts of 28,474 hectares (12.2%) of overall

area covered with 86.15% achievement. It is important to note that while these three states have

performed well in terms of overall achievements other states such as AP, Uttrakhand, Jharkhand

and Telangana have poor financial and physical progress. States such as Rajasthan has received

very little funding. Some states such as West Bengal and MP have not reported progress on MIS.

**No. of beneficiaries**

More than 1.5 lakh beneficiaries have benefited from the scheme since 2014, out of which 45%

belonged to schedule castes, tribes and backward classes and 18% are women.^294

integrated livestock into cropping system” and about 68% of the training target.

The progress on the outcome indicators are not available.

As per the Report on Impact Evaluation of Rainfed Area Development Component of NMSA, 2017,

more than 3/4th of the beneficiaries have indicated high level of satisfaction with RAD

interventions and would like it to continue.^297 It was also observed that RAD has resulted in more

involvement of extension workers and better coverage of soil health cards.

number of clusters have increased since 2014-15.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• RAD is an important component of NMSA which aims to encourage diversified integrated

farming in rainfed areas. RAD encourages cluster based approach and promotes an

integrated approach which promotes integrate nutrient management, soil health,

diversified farming, post-harvest interventions and marketing. Within RAD there is

significant stress on Dairy, poultry, horticulture, fisheries and agroforestry activities.

• The scheme is quite relevant as it adopts an area based approach for development and

conservation of natural resources along with farming systems. It was formulated on

‘watershed plus framework’ to explore potential utilization of natural resources

developed through watershed development and soil conservation

(^296) RAD dashboard  
(^297) Report on Impact Evaluation of Rainfed Area Development Component of NMSA, 2017 by AFC India Ltd

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

activities/interventions. It aims to promote integrated farming systems by focusing on

multi-cropping, crop rotation and allied activities like livestock, etc. Integrated farming

systems helps in minimizing adverse impact of crop failure through diversified systems.

• One of the components of the scheme is training of FPOs. However, the progress of the

scheme indicates limited focus on encouraging and training FPOs under the scheme.

**Effectiveness**

• Overall the programme has achieved only 75% of its targets from 2014-2019.

• In terms of output indicators, the scheme has achieved about 75% of its target for “Total

area brought under Integrated Farming System”, about 82% of the target of “Areas where

farmers integrated livestock into cropping system” and about 68% of the training target.

Analysis of MIS data indicates delay in release of first and second instalment to states.

• There is a large variability in the progress of the scheme in different states. While states

such as Tamil Nadu, UP, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Odisha have

received substantial funds, however, large rainfed state such as Rajasthan has not

received funds since 2015-16.

• The scheme has a large basket of interventions but majority of funds are spent on

integrated farming based interventions. Among the scheme components, about 90% of

funds are utilised on integrated farming.

• Landless farmers are not being covered under the scheme. They can also be provided

support for interventions such as bee keeping. This would increase the effectiveness of

the scheme.

**Efficiency**

• The financial achievement under the scheme has declined from 79% in 2015-16 to

60.86% in 2018-19.

• There is significant variation among states in utilisation of funds, many states have shown

progress on targeted indicators, however, have not yet submitted utilisation certificates.

• Unspent balance and utilisation of funds among states is a cause of concern.

• The programme has huge basket of interventions which are important in terms of climate

change. However, achievement and focus is limited to integrated farming or agro-forestry

based interventions.

• The cost norms under the guidelines need to be revised. Many interventions under the

scheme have lower cost norm than other schemes that are implementing similar schemes.

**Sustainability**

• RAD has a good MIS system but lack of technical and data entry staff at both state and

central level which impacts the effectiveness and sustainability of interventions. For

instance, information on progress of RAD activities after April 2019 has not been updated

on the website due to unavailability of staff.

• Within Integrated farming system there is limited focus on diversified cropping system.

While the scheme has a component, it is not actively encouraging coarse cereal, millets,

fibre, pulse and oilseed based cropping system. Maximum assistance that can be provided

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

under the scheme for diversified system is also very less (Rs 10,000 per hectare). This is

substantially lesser than supported provided for other components which varies from Rs

25,000 per hectare to Rs. 40,000 per hectare.

• Separate component needs to be included under the scheme on creating awareness about

climate change and sustainability or disaster risk reduction related to their operations.

**Impact**

• Many important activities related to soil moisture conservation and water harvesting

have been undertaken in a limited way under the scheme due to limited funding and low

cost norms. Efforts are being made to take up such activities through PMKSY-PDMC. The

funding for these components should also be increased under the scheme for maximizing

impact.

**Equity**

• The scheme has mandated to cover 30% women beneficiaries. However, till 2018-19 the

scheme has been able to cover about 27,583 women beneficiaries which accounts for only

18% of the total beneficiaries. KIIs revealed that the primary reason for limited coverage

of women beneficiaries is their limited agriculture landholding in rural areas.

• The scheme does not have any specific components on gender sensitization or awareness

generation. Such training components should also be included for increasing the women

participation.

• Nearly 25% funds are allocated under the scheme for SC/ST population. Nearly of 45% of

total beneficiaries under the scheme are SC/ST/OBC. Among the 1.5 lakh beneficiaries,

39,170 (26%) are SC and ST beneficiaries. However, some state have lower percentage of

SC/ST beneficiaries. For example, Tamil Nadu has only 12.72% SC and ST beneficiaries

against about 21% SC/ST population in the state. Such states may be encouraged to

include higher number of SC/ST beneficiaries.

**Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas**

i. Accountability and transparency

RAD envisages a central management information system for monitoring and progress of mission

activities. Data about RAD is available on the dedicated website of NMSA:

https://nmsa.dac.gov.in/. The updated guidelines, state-wise and district-wise progress, financial

allocations, releases, technical notes, circulars and other relevant documents related to the

scheme are available on the website.

The website also has information on number of beneficiaries, SC/ST/OBC beneficiaries, women

beneficiaries, etc. The funds transfers to the beneficiaries are done through DBT and these

transfers are linked to the DBT portal. Aadhar linked transfers of funds are also being ensured

under the scheme.

Independent evaluation study of RAD component under NMSA is also available on the website.

The project appraisals and approvals are governed by the latest citizen charter 2019-20 which is

available on department’s website. This is applicable to all the schemes. In addition, grievances if

any, can be raised on the CPGRAMS portal.

KIIs revealed that teams constituted by the Ministry and the state nodal agencies regularly visit

states and project sites to track project progress. Aadhar linked beneficiary transfer and

continuous social audits through PRI institutions also help in building transparency. In some

states details of the beneficiaries covered under RAD is also provided on the Panchayat Bhawans.

Social audit is being done in some states where PRI institutions are actively participating in

scheme implementation and identification of beneficiaries.

In addition, year wise annual action plans of all states upto 2018-19 are available on the website.

Details of clusters approved in each district as well as the money released for each cluster is also

available on the website. However, not all states have provided complete information.

ii. Gender mainstreaming

It is mandated to cover 30% women beneficiaries under the scheme. However till 2018-19 the

scheme has been able to cover about 27,583 women beneficiaries which accounts for only 18%

of the total beneficiaries. KIIs revealed that the primary reason for limited coverage of women

beneficiaries is their limited agriculture landholding in rural areas. The status of top ten states in

terms of women beneficiaries is given below.

beneficiaries. Among the top 10 states, Gujarat has the least percentage of female beneficiaries.

The scheme does not have any specific components on gender sensitization or awareness.

iii. Direct/Indirect employment

Information is not available on direct employment generated under RAD although as per the

available data, the scheme has benefited more than 1.5 lakh farmers. The scheme interventions

have targeted activities that helps in diversifying agriculture activities and helps in generating

indirect income. The list of top 10 states in terms of number of beneficiaries is given below.

iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient

practices & diversifications

RAD is a sub-component of National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). NMSA is

expected to transform Indian agriculture into a climate resilient production system through

multiple its various components. RAD focuses on building climate resilience through

diversification by promoting integrated farming systems and diversified farming. Through RAD

diversified pulse, oilseed, millet based cropping systems, horticulture based cropping systems,

Livestock based farming systems, tree/silvi-pastural agro forestry based systems and fishery

based farming systems can be promoted. In addition, for value addition and farm development

activities silage, apiculture, Water harvest conservation and resource conservation activities can

be taken up. Reclamation of problem soils and vermi-composting are few other components that

can contribute towards climate change adaptation. Training and capacity interventions involve

training on concept of integrated farming, climate change adaptation, Good Agriculture Practices

on soil water and crop management natural resources for food and livelihood security. A cluster

based approach is being followed and efforts are being made to promote integrated nutrient

management practices and on farm water management interventions in identified clusters

through other schemes of NMSA and PMKSY-PDMC. However, among the scheme components,

more than 40% of funds are utilised on livestock based farming and 90% on integrated farming.

There is a need to promote peripheral plantation, agro-horti-silvi systems and there is a need for

more focus on soil reclamation and value addition and farm development activities to promote

protective irrigation and input efficiency.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the scheme

in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

Nearly 25% funds are allocated for SC/ST population. The state wise allocation funds under SCSP

and TSP component is available on the RAD MIS dashboard. Nearly of 45% of total beneficiaries

under the scheme are SC/ST/OBC. Among the 1.5 lakh beneficiaries, 39,170 (26%) are SC and ST

beneficiaries.

Figure 171 : Number of beneficiaries under RAD (2014-2020)

Tamil Nadu has the highest number of SC/ST beneficiaries but the % of SC/ST beneficiaries as %

of overall beneficiaries is less (12.72%). Chhattisgarh has nearly 60% SC/ST beneficiaries with

most of them being tribals. Odisha too has decent coverage of SC/ST beneficiaries (42.98%), again

most of them being tribals. Among the top ten states, Uttar Pradesh has nearly 26% of SC/ST

beneficiaries with most of them belonging to scheduled caste. Nearly 100% of beneficiaries in

Mizoram and Meghalaya are Tribals.

vi. Use of IT/Technology in driving efficiency

RAD envisages a central management information system for monitoring and progress of mission

activities. Data about RAD is available on the dedicated website of NMSA

https://nmsa.dac.gov.in/. As mentioned earlier, the updated guidelines, state-wise district wise

progress, financial allocations, release, technical notes, circulars and other relevant document are

available on the website.

The website also has information on number of beneficiaries, SC/ST/OBC and women

beneficiaries. The fund transfer to beneficiaries is DBT based. Aadhar linked transfers of funds is

also being ensured under the scheme.

The information available on the MIS helps in increasing transparency among stakeholders.

However, KIIs revealed that due to lack technical and support staff at both central and state level,

the MIS is not being updated regularly. Efforts are also needed for geo-tagging of assets created

under the scheme or mapping the identified clusters.

vii. Unlocking Synergies with other Government Programmes

The national, state and district level committees have members from various line departments

and representatives from support institutions, which encourages participation of other

departments. Within the scheme guidelines and implementation structure, there is focus to

dovetail interventions from other NMSA components e.g. soil health card, soil health management

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

with RAD. The Panchayati Raj Institutions in some states are also playing active role in selection

of beneficiaries. The evaluation report^298 also highlights that in the intervention areas, the

extension coverage has improved. In addition, during the planning state there is a focus within

the RFS division to dovetail activities of RAD and PMKSY-PDMC. KIIs and technical notes/ fund

release documents revealed that that the soil moisture conservation activities and water

harvesting related interventions in the scheme areas or clusters are being taken up through

PMKSY. RAD has convergence by PMKSY, MGNREGA as such for activities of water conservation,

watershed management etc are well addressed through convergence.

**_viii. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives (e.g._**

Farmer cooperatives, FPOs, Water User Associations, etc.) and civil society in the

scheme

Although the scheme has components on training of FPOs, the progress report indicates limited

focus on encouraging and training FPOs under the scheme. More FPOs need to be encouraged

under the scheme in the selected clusters.

Issues and Challenges

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The scheme has Pan India coverage and but the states are not satisfied with the scale of  
    finance^299 , this is due to paucity of funds.
2.  Need for simplified area based assistance system and flexibility in implementation of  
    Annual action plan was highlighted by the states^300
3.  Need for better coordination between farmers and implementation agencies

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  While the scheme focuses on integrated farming and promotion of value addition activities  
    such as apiculture, Green house etc., extension material such as guidelines on recommended  
    cropping practices suitable of different agro-climatic zones and soil types is missing. Such  
    material can be handy for farmers of beneficiaries that are interested taking up diversified  
    activities.
2.  IFS systems are not adequately supported by water harvesting and soil and moisture  
    conservation initiatives^301.
3.  The cost norms under the guidelines are old and needs to be revised. Many interventions  
    under the scheme have lower cost norm than other schemes that are implementing similar  
    schemes. Many important activities related to soil moisture conservation, water harvesting  
    cannot be undertaken under the scheme due to limited funding and low cost norms. Efforts  
    are being made to take up such activities through PMKSY-PDMC
4.  Non reporting of progress by some states affects scheme implementation.
5.  Dearth of technical and support staff affects implementation of program. For instance, there  
    are no technical resources at central level that can update MIS system and help in geo-  
    tagging of assets/farms supported under the scheme
6.  The target of 30% women farmers is not being achieved by the states due to difficulty in  
    finding women farm owners who are interested in scheme.
7.  Landless farmers are not being covered under the scheme. They can also be provided  
    support for interventions such as bee keeping^302.
8.  The programme has huge basket of interventions which are important in terms of climate  
    change. However, achievement and focus is limited to integrated farming or agro-forestry  
    based interventions.

_B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation_

1.  Overall the programme has achieved only 69.51% of its financial targets from 2014-2019.  
    The financial achievement under the scheme has declined from 79% in 2015-16 to  
    60.86% in 2018-19.
2.  The scheme has a large basket of interventions but majority of funds are spent on  
    Integrated farming based interventions. Till 2018-19, 90% of funds were spent on  
    integrated farming based interventions (20.27% horticulture based, 40.84% dairy based  
    13.64% small ruminant poultry based, 2% fisheries based) and 13.33% on cropping  
    systems with peripheral plantations.
3.  There is a wide state-wise variation in the implementation status. Tamil Nadu and UP  
    received highest funding under the scheme. Other states that received substantial funds  
    are Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. However, large rainfed states  
    such as Rajasthan has not received funds since 2015-16.
4.  Analysis of MIS data indicates delay in release of first and second instalment to states. In  
    some cases, first instalment has been released as late as November and second instalment  
    has been released as late as 30th March. Any instalment released late especially from

(^302) Report on Impact evaluation of Rainfed area development component of NMSA, 2017 by AFC India Ltd

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

January to March leave very little time for utilisation. This delay in disbursal negatively

affect the scheme implementation. Considering 90% of scheme interventions are focused

on integrating farming, funds needs to be released before the start of cropping seasons.

Delay in release of funds as contributions by states affect program implementation and

many states have not utilised funds provided during last three years^303

C. Capacity building

1.  Lack of awareness among farmers about the scheme is major bottleneck, farmers also tend  
    to change their decision frequently as in many cases they agree to take up certain activities  
    but then change their mind this affect scheme implementation. Slow and lengthy procedure  
    of financial disbursement also affect stakeholder engagement. Need for FPOs was  
    highlighted by farmers in identified clusters in RAD impact evaluation report.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  RAD has a good MIS system but lack of technical and data entry staff at both state and  
    central levels impact the effectiveness of interventions.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed below:

(^303) https://nmsa.dac.gov.in/pdfDoc/Meetings/RADMinutes\_04122017.pdf accessed on 27/12/2019  
**Key Reasons for Low Fund Utilization for Certain Components and Among  
States:**  
• Many states are not reporting progress or provided utilisation, the progress of  
activities also gets affected due to low cost norms because of which states are  
not able to implement the same.  
• Delay in release of funds as contributions by states affect program implementation  
• Analysis of MIS data indicates delay in release of first and second instalment to  
states. In some cases, first instalment has been released as late as November and  
second instalment has been released as late as 30th March. Any instalment released  
late especially from January to March leave very little time for utilisation. This delay  
in disbursal negatively affect the scheme implementation. Considering 90% of  
scheme interventions are focused on integrating farming, funds needs to be  
released before the start of cropping seasons.

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the key recommendations for the scheme:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The scheme is quite relevant as it adopts an area based approach for development and  
    conservation of natural resources along with farming systems. It was formulated on  
    ‘watershed plus framework’ to explore potential utilization of natural resources  
    developed through watershed development and soil conservation  
    activities/interventions. It aims to promote integrated farming systems by focusing on  
    multi-cropping, crop rotation and allied activities like livestock, apiculture etc. Integrated  
    farming systems helps in minimizing adverse impact of crop failure through diversified  
    systems. Therefore, the scheme can be prioritized for implementation and its scale of fund  
    can be improved.
2.  State level consultation can be carried out to seek states feedback and the guidelines and  
    implementation mechanism can be modified accordingly for more flexibility in guidelines
3.  Better coordination between farmers and implementation agencies can be established  
    through active engagement, frequent meetings, trainings and workshops
4.  The programme has huge basket of interventions which are important in terms of climate  
    change. However, achievement and focus is limited to integrated farming or agro-forestry  
    based interventions. Focus can be given to unique interventions like reclamation of  
    problem soils, in-situ moisture conservation, gully control, vermi-bed, and value added  
    resource conservation systems Greenhouse structures.
5.  Within Integrated farming system there is limited focus on diversified cropping system.  
    While the scheme has a component, it is not actively encouraging coarse cereal, millets,  
    fibre, pulse and oilseed based cropping system. Maximum assistance that can be provided  
    under the scheme for diversified system is also very less (Rs 10,000 per hectare). This is  
    substantially lesser than supported provided for other components which varies from Rs  
    25,000 per hectare to Rs. 40,000 per hectare. Rationalization of such cost norms also  
    needs to be done. IFS systems also needs to be supported by watershed conservation  
    activities.
6.  The cost norms of the activities under the scheme needs to be revised at par with other  
    schemes that support similar activities
7.  Department may take up consultation with states to seek reasons for non-reporting of  
    progress and see if it can provide any assistance to handle the situation.
8.  Technical and support staff for updating MIS must be immediately recruited, they may be  
    provided fixed term contract, with appropriate appraisal mechanism.
9.  As mentioned, it is mandated to cover 30% women beneficiaries under the scheme.  
    However till 2018-19 the scheme has been able to cover about 27,583 women  
    beneficiaries which accounts for only 18% of the total beneficiaries. KIIs revealed that the  
    primary reason for limited coverage of women beneficiaries is their limited agriculture  
    landholding in rural areas. Therefore, there is a need to provide special focus on inclusion  
    of women under the scheme through specific promotional activities. Also, landless women

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

farmers should also be provided support for interventions such as bee keeping, etc. This

would help to increase the women participation in the scheme.

1.  Landless farmers can be supported through interventions like beekeeping, farmers who  
    are cultivating on leased land can also be provided financial support from scheme on the  
    basis of lease contract.
2.  Apart from IFS and animal husbandry focus needs to be given to unique interventions like  
    reclamation of problem soils, in-situ moisture conservation, gully control, vermi-bed, and  
    value added resource conservation systems Greenhouse structures.^304
3.  There is a need to promote peripheral plantation and agro-horti-silvi systems under the  
    scheme. These are important activities with high environmental benefits. Also, more focus  
    should be on soil reclamation, value addition and farm development activities to promote  
    protective irrigation and input efficiency. There has been limited implementation of these  
    components under the scheme.
4.  Continuous support for multiple years should be provided for horticulture and forestry  
    crops for maintenance.
5.  While the scheme includes components on integrated farming and promotion of value  
    addition activities such as apiculture, greenhouse etc., extension materials such as  
    guidelines on recommended cropping practices suitable of different agro-climatic zones  
    and soil types are missing. Such materials would be beneficial for farmers of beneficiaries  
    that are interested taking up diversified activities.
6.  Geo-tagging of all assets created under the scheme should be taken up on priority

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  In terms of output indicators, the scheme has achieved about 75% of its target for “Total  
    area brought under Integrated Farming System”, about 82% of the target of “Areas where  
    farmers integrated livestock into cropping system” and about 68% of the training target.  
    Analysis of MIS data indicates delay in release of first and second instalment to states. This  
    delay in disbursal negatively affect the scheme implementation. Moreover, delay in  
    release of funds as contributions by some states affect program implementation. Many  
    states have not utilised funds provided during last three years^305. The whole process of  
    approval of proposals, release and subsequent transfer of funds, revision of proposals and  
    utilization reporting, etc. need to be streamlined to reduce delays. The performance of the  
    scheme can be improved after revision of cost norms and deployment of technical and  
    support staff for scheme monitoring at central level, close engagement with stakeholders  
    and farmers will also help in improved performance.
2.  The scheme has a large basket of interventions but majority of funds are spent on  
    integrated farming based interventions. Among the scheme components, about 90% of  
    funds are utilized on integrated farming. There is a need to promote peripheral plantation,  
    agro-horti-silvi systems and more focus is required on soil reclamation and value addition  
    and farm development activities to promote protective irrigation and input efficiency.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Awareness generation amongst the intended beneficiaries regarding the various

components should be focused on.

1.  As mentioned earlier, unspent balance and utilization of funds among states is a cause of  
    concern. Accordingly more intense engagement with the lagging states should be taken  
    up for distributed performance of the scheme. Following measures will also encourage  
    better participation across states

o The cost norms under the guidelines are old and needs to be revised. Many

interventions under the scheme have lower cost norm than other schemes that

are implementing similar schemes. Hence, the cost norms should be revised

based on actual market rates.

o Scheme has huge basket of interventions, the interventions that are in line with

the state’s needs can be encouraged, this will motivate states for participating in

the scheme. In addition revision of cost norms will also help facilitate better

implementation across states. The cost norm of interventions may be associated

with the prevailing wage rates in states or districts. This will help in ensuring

better flexibility for states to implement activities.

1.  Delay in the release of the funds to state should be addressed to encourage state’s  
    participation. Consultation with states should be carried out to understand their need and  
    encourage their participation. The scheme guidelines can be also be revised on the basis  
    of their inputs, this will increase transparency and encourage states to participate.
2.  Nearly 25% funds are allocated under the scheme for SC/ST population. Nearly of 45% of  
    total beneficiaries under the scheme are SC/ST/OBC. Among the 1.5 lakh beneficiaries,  
    39,170 (26%) are SC and ST beneficiaries. However, some states have lower percentage  
    of SC/ST beneficiaries. For example, Tamil Nadu has only 12.72% SC and ST beneficiaries  
    against about 21% SC/ST population in the state. Such states may be encouraged to  
    include higher number of SC/ST beneficiaries.

C. Capacity building

1.  One of the components of the scheme is training of FPOs. However, the progress of the  
    scheme indicates limited focus on encouraging and training FPOs under the scheme. It is  
    important to focus on FPOs to promote their involvement in the scheme. This will ensure  
    a wider reach of the scheme. FPOs can help in collection, primary processing and  
    marketing of the produce. FPOs can be linked with dairy cooperatives and can also avail  
    benefits from schemes such as SMAM for establishing custom hiring centres. More focused  
    trainings are required for the FPOs in this regard.
2.  Landless farmers are not being covered under the scheme. They can also be provided  
    support for interventions such as bee keeping^306. This would increase the effectiveness of  
    the scheme.
3.  The scheme does not have any specific components on gender sensitization or awareness  
    generation. Such training components should also be included for increasing the women  
    participation.

(^306) Report on Impact evaluation of Rainfed area development component of NMSA, 2017 by AFC India Ltd

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  Separate component needs to be included under the scheme on creating awareness about  
    climate change and sustainability or disaster risk reduction related to their operations.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  RAD has a good MIS system but lack of technical and data entry staff at both state and  
    central levels impact the effectiveness of interventions. For instance, information on  
    progress of RAD activities after April 2019 has not been updated on the website due to  
    unavailability of staff. Recruitment of the required staff can help in strengthening the  
    implementation of the scheme.
2.  The output and outcome indicators do not cover the intended objectives and various  
    components of the scheme fully. The output indicators of the scheme presently include 1)  
    total area brought under RAD, 2) Areas where farmers integrated livestock into cropping  
    system and 3) Number of training conducted. There are no output indicators for activities  
    such as fisheries based farming systems, agro-forestry, value added resource  
    conservation system, water harvesting and related activities, demonstrations, post-  
    harvest activities, etc. Similarly, the outcome indicators are also not aligned to the project  
    objectives and the different activities covered under the scheme. Hence, there is a need to  
    re-define the output-outcome indicators for the scheme.
3.  There is a large variability in the progress of the scheme in different states. While states  
    such as Tamil Nadu, UP, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Odisha have  
    received substantial funds, however, large rainfed state such as Rajasthan has not  
    received funds since 2015-16. There is a need for more distributed performance across  
    states and accordingly more intense engagement with the lagging states should be taken  
    up, particularly with states having high rainfed cultivation area.
4.  The progress on the output-outcome indicators are not available. The output-outcome  
    indicators also do not cover many of the scheme activities. Aligning the output-outcome  
    indicators with scheme objectives and activities is critical for assessing the impact of the  
    scheme. Moreover, year wise target setting and measuring the progress against the target  
    should be undertaken annually.
5.  Information is not available on direct employment generated under RAD although as per  
    the available data, the scheme has benefited more than 1.5 lakh farmers. The scheme  
    interventions have targeted activities that helps in diversifying agriculture activities and  
    helps in generating indirect income. It is recommended that the employment generation  
    through the scheme activities may be recording and maintained as it would assist in the  
    assessment of the scheme.

E. Convergence with other schemes and programs

1.  Many important activities related to soil moisture conservation and water harvesting  
    have been undertaken in a limited way under the scheme due to limited funding and low  
    cost norms. Efforts are being made to take up such activities through PMKSY-PDMC. As  
    mentioned earlier, there is need for revising cost norms for project on a periodic basis.  
    The funding for these components should also be increased under the scheme.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Key Inputs from Previous Evaluation of the Scheme:

Following issues have been highlighted by the impact evaluation report of the scheme

o The scheme has pan India coverage and but the states are not satisfied with the

scale of finance, this is due to paucity of funds.

o Need for simplified area based assistance system and flexibility in

implementation of Annual action plan was highlighted by the states

o IFS systems are not adequately supported by water harvesting and soil and

moisture conservation initiatives

o Need for FPOs was highlighted by farmers in identified clusters

Our analysis of the data and information shows that these gaps are still not addressed

in the scheme. The guidelines and focus of interventions needs to be revised to address

these aspects.

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

Considering more than 55% of total agricultural area in India is rainfed, development

of rainfed area should be a priority area for Government.

The scheme is important as it has multiple components which helps in diversification,

soil conservation and promotion of sustainable practices. Therefore, it should be

continued with minor changes under NMSA.

However, the performance of the scheme can be improved as the cost norms for

components need to be revised and focus needs to be provided on all activities under

the scheme.

2.2.14 Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana

Background of the Scheme

India has witnessed a transcendental change as a country from being food deficit to self-

sustaining by the use of genetically modified (GM) high yielding varieties of crops used by the

farmers during the Green Revolution. But the country has witnessed over use of chemical

fertilizers and pesticides applied to the crops

resulting in long drawn adverse effects to

human health and also a decline in productivity.

At this point, concerns over the sustainability

aspect of India’s agriculture were being raised.

This set the stage for another switch which the

country had to make towards adoption of

organic farming. The first policy level support

from the government’s side came in the year

2005, when the Ministry of Agriculture,

Department of Agriculture & Cooperation

published their first Organic Farming Policy.

This particular policy support in the year 2005,

was followed by another important milestone

policy framework coming in the form of National

Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)

deriving its mandate from the Sustainable

Agriculture Mission, incorporated as one of the

key missions of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC).

International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) had pointed out in 2013

about India’s major contribution towards the uptake of organic farming across the globe^307. The

country’s leading global position in the field of organic farming has come at a time when the

agricultural sector was witnessing a paradigm shift towards organic farming techniques catalyzed

by the rising consumer preference for organic products. Keeping this context in mind, the NMSA’s

objectives had set the stage for the formulation a dedicated policy addressing the organic farming

requirements of the country.

Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) marked its inception from the year 2015. PKVY, one of

the sub components of Soil Health Management (SHM) scheme under the National Mission of

Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), focuses on the large scale uptake of organic farming techniques

across the country. The PKVY was introduced and implemented through a clustered approach of

institutionalizing the farmers and having their quality assurance ensured through Participatory

Guarantee System (PGS) under PGS-India programme. The farmers who are involved in farming

through organic methods have to adopt the practices and comply with those, as have been

mentioned in the PGS- India standards. The compatibility of the system with that of the

geographical area and the selection of a particular crop needs to be thoroughly checked so that

the optimum yield with adequate nutrients can be achieved. Some of the other government

schemes which promote adoption of organic farming are presented below.

Figure 173 : Few Government Schemes which promote Organic Farming

Objectives of the programme

From a more holistic standpoint, PKVY aims to curb down the harmful use of agro chemicals by

shifting towards much more sustainable organic methods and in turn have a positive impact on

the fertility of the soil. The scheme aims to successfully form 10,000 clusters over a span of three

years and bring five lakh acres of agricultural area under organic farming.

On specific terms, the scheme has broadly six objectives^308 , which can be listed down as follows:

1.  To promote natural resource based integrated and climate resilient sustainable farming  
    systems in order to ensure maintenance and increase of soil fertility, natural resource  
    conservation, on-farm nutrient recycling and minimize dependence of farmers on  
    external inputs.
2.  To reduce cost of agriculture to farmers through sustainable integrated organic farming  
    systems thereby enhancing farmer's net income per unit of land.
3.  To sustainably produce chemical free and nutritious food for human consumption.
4.  To protect environment from hazardous inorganic chemicals by adoption of ecofriendly  
    low cost traditional techniques and farmer friendly technologies.
5.  To empower farmers through their own institutional development in the form of clusters  
    and group with capacity to manage production, processing, value addition and  
    certification management.
6.  Building direct market linkages at local as well as national market levels for the farmers  
    and thus inculcating entrepreneurship in them.^309

Strategy and focus areas

The strategy of PKVY has been to bridge the gap between supply and demand of the organic foods

market. The scheme envisages to broadly focus on the following key areas:

• Commercial production of crops by adoption of organic farming techniques certified

through PGS mechanism.

• Improvement in the health of consumers by supplying pesticide free produce.

• Building on the financial capacity of the farmers through higher income generation and

creation of new potential market linkages, beneficial for the traders.

• Help in developing the natural resource mobilization through motivational support

provided to the farmers.^310

Main Features of the Scheme

• The cluster chosen for PKVY should be 20 ha or 50 acres, to be selected in as continuous

fashion as possible.

• The farmers will get an assistance of INR 10 lakh/ farmer member and an additional

assistance of INR 4.95 lakh will be provided against PGS Certification and mobilization

having a ceiling value of 1 ha/farmer.

• A minimum of 65% of the selected farmers to be categorized as small/marginal. This

particular criteria to be met at the cluster level. Only in case of any deviation, this can be

extended to mandal/block/taluka/district levels.

• Nearly one-third (30%) of the total allocation made should be earmarked for women

beneficiaries.

Programme components

The key components^311 under PKVY are represented by the figure below:

**Model Organic Cluster Demonstrations** are primarily involved in garnering the awareness

among the stakeholders involved like the farmers, rural youth, consumers and traders on the

state-of-the-art latest technologies that are currently in use for organic farming. There are a few

Implementing Agencies (IA) like Regional Councils (RC) registered with PGS, Zonal Councils (ZC)

belonging to NCOF those are involved in implementation of model organic cluster demonstration

work at the farmer’s field in clusters of 20 ha or 50 acres. Model Organic Cluster Demonstration

has the following activities that are performed:

the Implementing Agencies (IA) are involved having a similar kind of funding pattern like Model

Organic Cluster Demonstrations.

Institutional Framework

PKVY activities are taken up at three different levels, National, State and District levels. Dedicated

committees and bodies are set up at all the three levels to facilitate the smooth functioning and

implementation of the activities, tracking the progress as per the set indicators and monitor the

various external agencies those have been appointed under the scheme.

A detailed description of the different bodies that have been set up and their corresponding roles

has been depicted through the figure below.

Intended contribution to the sector

Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) launched in the year 2015 as a sub component to the

Soil Health Management (SHM) scheme under the National Mission of Sustainable Agriculture

(NMSA). The main agenda of launching this mission was to address the immediate need of

providing a robust policy framework towards organic farming in the country. India has seen an

overwhelming demand of its food grains with the rising population which the country has seen

over the past decades. Keeping this mind, the NMSA helped in adoption of sustainable practices

in farming, keeping in mind judicious use of natural resources.

At this juncture, PKVY has been introduced as a much more targeted scheme aimed at improving

the health of the soil through use of organic methods in farming and thus reducing the over use of

agro chemicals which has been one of the key components affecting the health of the soil. The

improvement in soil health in PKVY has been planned to be achieved through a mix of traditional

wisdom and advance technological interventions in order to attain the desirable outcome of long

term and improved soil fertility and health. PKVY also addresses the long debated topic of farmer

empowerment and improving the farmer income through building of a robust institutional

framework for the farmers by adoption of a cluster based approach for improved farm

management, quality assurance, input production, value addition and also streamlining the

marketing of the produce through innovative means. The Participatory Guarantee System (PGS)

*   India standards will be acting as the guidelines for the quality assurance part covered under

(^312) The picture has been adopted from the below link:

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

PKVY. All the compliance parameters which need to be adhered to by the farmers are abided as

per the PGS standards. Thus the scheme is aligned to the country’s transformation towards

organic farming and improvement of soil health through sustainable agricultural practices. This,

in turn, will address the rising consumer demand for organic food witnessed across the country.

Intended contribution to national and international goals

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) formulated by the United Nations (UN) has now been

intricately woven in the fabric of development designed by the specific countries, in this case

India. The National Development Agenda of the country implemented through various schemes

across multiple countries, have been closely aligned with the SDGs.

PKVY aims to bring about the adoption of organic food production and thus ensure a long term

sustainable food production cycle is followed also helping in the improving the income

opportunities for the farmers involved. By working towards the achievement of these objectives,

PKVY has been aligned towards the SDGs and also the National Development Agenda, as depicted

in the following table.

Consistent increase in budget estimates can be seen across the years. However, every year there

is a gap between budget estimates and revised estimates. Utilization of funds under the scheme

has been consistently above 90% during 2015-16 to 2018-19, except in 2017-18.

The allocation of the funds for the three consecutive financial years for all the states is as

From the table above, it can be inferred that Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand have

continued to dominate the top three places in terms of number of clusters formed and the total

allocation of funds received. On the other hand, the North-Eastern states (excluding Assam) have

not fared well over the years under the scheme and continue to be lagging in performance (this

could be because NER has focused scheme for promotion of organic farming in the region) along

with Haryana also belonging to the same category.

Physical Performance

The till date physical performance of PKVY can be highlighted as follows:

PKVY has been effective in establishing a strong footprint across the country during its operations

since 2015.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Phase I** : Total amount allocated for the scheme 2015-16 to 2017-18 is Rs 947 crore and fund

released Rs 696.75 crore till date. Total 11891 clusters have been formed during the period 2015-

16 to 2017-18. Under PKVY scheme, 237820 hectares of land has been converted into organic

farming land and 5,94,550 farmers have been benefited.

**Phase II** : During 2018-19 fund released for 17,968 clusters 1st year activities for 3.59 lakh ha

area, total amount allocated for the scheme 2018-19 to 2019-20 is Rs 685 crore and fund released

Rs 441.57 crore till date.

Therefore, total 5.97 lakh ha area covered for 29,859 clusters and 14.93 lakh farmers have been

benefitted in both phase. Moreover, more than three hundred Regional Councils (RC) have played

a pivotal role in issuance of nearly six lakh certificates under the PGS – India certification

programme.

From the below graphical representation, the state wise distribution of clusters can be seen where

the chart has been topped by Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh having

the highest number of clusters formed under the PKVY scheme during 2015 - 18.

The data on output and outcomes is not available for the scheme.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• PKVY aims to bring about the adoption of organic food production and thus ensure a long

term sustainable food production cycle, also helping in improving the income

opportunities for the farmers involved. The scheme is aligned to the country’s

transformation towards organic farming and improvement of soil health through

sustainable agricultural practices.

• The scheme is highly relevant for the development of agriculture sector and is in-line with

future requirements for sustainable growth. The output-outcome indicators can be

strengthened in consultation with the ministry for effective monitoring and impact

assessment of the scheme.

• With respect to the outcome indicators, the indicators do not cover some of the objectives

and intended outcomes of the scheme such as reduction in cost of agriculture to farmers

through sustainable integrated organic farming systems, increase in farmer’s income,

market linkages established at local as well as national market levels for the farmers,

promotion of entrepreneurship, etc.

**Effectiveness**

• As mentioned above, a total of 5.97 lakh ha area has been covered for 29,859 clusters and

14.93 lakh farmers have been benefitted under the scheme. Moreover, nearly six lakh

certificates under the PGS – India certification programme have been issued. While the

scheme has increased adoption of organic farming in the country, the funding allocations

need to be increased and utilized optimally for scheme to be effective, considering that

India has over 140 million ha of net sowing land.

TARGET ACHIEVEMENT

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• The clusters are concentrated in the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan

and Andhra Pradesh as these states are having the highest number of clusters formed

under the PKVY scheme during 2015-18. There is need to engage with some of the other

agrarian states such as Haryana, West Bengal, etc. considering the substantial potential

and opportunities.

• The scheme has performed satisfactorily, however, performance is not measured for

output and outcome indicators on a yearly basis.

**Efficiency**

• The utilization of funds under PKVY have been over 90% on an average over last 4 years.

However, the state wise budgetary allocation towards organic farming is on the lower

side, with some states having less than 2% of their budget allocated towards organic

farming.

• There has been a consistent increase in budgeted estimates across the years. However,

every year there is a gap between budget estimates and revised estimates.

**Sustainability**

• The training and capacity building of the farmers needs to include field level aspects of

organic farming and support required to sustain. These activities need to be

supplemented with exposure visits to model farms.

• There is need to focus on development of marketing opportunities for better price

realization to farmers along with promotion of production.

• The development of supporting infrastructure is important for reduction in wastages of

organic produce, as long duration for transportation and lack of storage, etc. lead to

wastage of produce and discourage farmers involved in organic farming.

**Impact**

• PGS certified products need to be provided assured markets for sustainability and

maximum impact.

• The funds allocated to states, in some cases, are further allocated to districts without

identification of clusters for organic farming which results in non-achievement of

intended outcomes and limits impact.

• As organic farming needs to be encouraged on priority basis throughout the country,

specific budgets need to be allocated for deputing required dedicated officers for

promotion of organic farming in the states and districts. Moreover, markets need to be

established and promoted for sale of organic produce directly to consumers.

• PKVY must push for pesticide residue testing, which will give the necessary weightage to

product testing aspect of the certification.

• Labelling provisions based on compliance with organic process and pesticide testing in

products are not part of the scheme guidelines.

**Equity**

• A component of gender-budgeting exists in the scheme. However, there are no specific

trainings offered to women to enhance their roles as decision makers.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• The scheme allocates funds to SC/STs to ensure participation of these marginalized

groups in the sector. However, specific measures and awareness campaigns need to be

undertaken to encourage these groups to enter this sector.

**Discussion on Cross Sectional Thematic Areas**

i. Accountability and Transparency

The implementation structure of PKVY has got three important layers at the national, state and

district levels. This three level structure ensures that there remains a high level of accountability

in the entire system. This kind of a structure ensures that there is a uniformity and transparency

across the entire vertical and there is last mile delivery of intended services to the targeted group

of beneficiaries.

At the national level, there is a National Advisory Committee (NAC) responsible for the

formulation of policies and providing an overall direction to the entire team. The NAC is chaired

by the Joint Secretary of the Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) Division of the Department

of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW). The Executive Secretary of the NAC

is the Director of National Centre of Organic Farming. The National Project Management Team is

also there for implementation and the operational aspects to be carried out at the country level.

A robust monitoring mechanism is also in place for close tracking of the project activities. The

INM division of the DAC&FW closely monitors the progress and the scheme and the NCOF is

responsible for the monitoring of the PGS Certification.

At the state level the State Level Executive Committee (SLEC) regularly monitors and reviews the

action plan, on which, the State Project Management Team engages consultants, support agencies

and regional councils for the duty of cluster formation and PGS certification respectively. The state

PMT also oversees the work done by the district level authorities.

At the district level again, a 3 tier implementation framework is present, which can be depicted

as below^315 :

(^315) Source: https://darpg.gov.in/sites/default/files/Paramparagat%20Krishi%20Vikas%20Yojana.pdf

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The top level functionaries at the district level, is responsible for monitoring of the activities and

check whether the said activities are implemented in a timely and compliant manner, ensure

regular field inspections by the District Agriculture Officer, conduct monthly review meetings and

consolidate and send the monthly progress report to the state level authorities.

Apart from the monitoring done by the human resources, a centralized MIS, geo tagging of the

clusters^316 and the Jaivik Kheti Portal also ensures that the project developments are updated in

a timely manner and the information is available on the public domain. However, the scheme

needs to improve on transparency as no information about scheme progress is available on public

domain. The information on RCs and district local level registered under the scheme can be

accessed from PGS portal^317.

ii. Direct / indirect employment generation

PKVY does not have employment generation as one of its primary objectives. The entire

implementation structure of PKVY includes several Regional Councils (RC), support agencies,

consultants, farmer producer organizations, local groups among others. As a result when these

bodies are entrusted certain responsibilities, they require adequate manpower in order to

implement the work. Resource persons are hired by the local groups to train the farmers and

facilitate the knowledge transfer on organic farming. However, there is no data available on the

number of such jobs which have been created as a result of implementation of PKVY.

iii. Gender Mainstreaming

In the mandate prescribed under PKVY, there is a clear mention that preference needs to be

given to women farmers and women operated Self Help Groups. Earmarking of funds to at least

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

30% towards women beneficiaries either individually or through the SHGs has been made.

However, no other special incentives or provisions are given to ensure women participation in

the scheme. The data on number of women beneficiaries is not available in secondary sources.

iv. Climate Change and Sustainability including Climate Change Resilient practices and

diversifications

Agriculture production is directly linked to climate change and weather^318. The natural resources

on which the productivity of depends, is largely affected by the climate change being experienced

across the globe. At this juncture of time, the need of the hour is to adopt farming practices that

will be resilient to climatic changes and will take a lesser toll on the natural resources.

India has been primarily using agro chemicals for increasing the productivity thus largely

affecting the soil health. In order to curb down these harmful effects and plan for a sustainable

and long term agricultural practice, it has been almost undeniable that India should have adopted

organic farming. Keeping this aspect in mind, as a sub component to the Soil Health Management

under NMSA, PKVY was launched. One of the prime objectives of the scheme has been to ensure

the adoption of climate resilient organic farming practices that will help in developing the health

of the soil by mitigating the damage done due to the extensive use of fertilizers and pesticides.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the

scheme in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

There are no special incentives or provisions to encourage Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes

and other weaker segments of society participation in the scheme.

vi. Development, dissemination and adoption of innovative practices technology and

know-how

PKVY comes with an array of technological interventions. Right from dissemination of knowledge

to imparting training to the farmers through transfer of technology. In order to improve the

market value of the organic produce, a number of refined low cost processing technologies are

also taken up. PKVY has promoted the right mix of new scientific technologies along with the

traditional knowledge already with the farmers.

At the cluster level, the scheme promotes the adoption of a number of technological interventions

as listed below:

• Organic Input Production Unit

• Biological Nitrogen Harvest Planting

• Botanical Extract Production Unit

• Phosphate Rich Organic Manure

• Custom Hiring Centre Services

• Walk-in Tunnel for Horticultural Crops etc.

Among the interventions mentioned above, farmers have reaped benefits mostly from Organic

Input Production Unit, Biological Nitrogen Planting and the Botanical Extract Production Unit.

in-india- 2332 - 2594.1000109.pdf

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

vii. Stakeholder and beneficiary behavior change

An impact study of PKVY was conducted by National Institute of Agricultural Extension

Management (MANAGE), Hyderabad. This particular study shows that the adoption of organic

farming practices by the farmers have increased year on year. There has been a significant

creation of awareness among the farmers about organic farming because of the campaigns

conducted by Agricultural Technology Management Agencies (ATMA). Responses captured from

the farmers on the future continuity of organic farming also seem to be quite promising as has

been mentioned in the report. The figure below summarizes the benefits associated with organic

farming which acts as motivation for the farmers:

Figure 181 : Motivation for Adoption of Organic Agriculture – Adopted from Impact Study of

PKVY by MANAGE

On the contrary, there are also views of farmers where they have shown their discontent on the

lack in proper training mechanisms and practical knowledge transfer. The budgetary allocation

they received also seemed to be not meeting the needs, with the profitability of the organic

produce coming down as a result of lack of dedicated market place to sell.

**_viii. Technology / Adoption of ICT_**

PKVY has focused strongly towards building a “Rasayan Mukt Bharat” and in order to attain this

goal, the Jaivik Kheti portal has been created. The Jaivik Kheti portal is the perfect example of

leveraging ICT to build a one stop e commerce and knowledge sharing platform for the organic

produce of the country. The Jaivik Kheti portal acts as the melting pot for the regional councils,

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

local groups, individual farmers, buys, suppliers and the government agencies to come together

and work in an inclusive way for the benefit of all the stakeholders. A few of the services available

on the Jaivik Kheti portal are listed below:

• Buyer registration

• Seller registration

• Local Group registration

• Input supplier registration

• Forward auction

• Price-quantity bidding

• Book building and

• Reverse auction mechanisms

In addition to the Jaivik Kheti portal, a centralized MIS for the PKVY has also been planned. The

MIS will track the progress across the physical as well as the financial yardsticks decided. The MIS

can be accessed online from the website of PKVY. The MIS will also facilitate the visual

representation of the clusters which have been geo-tagged.

It is a dedicated portal for organic farming. This portal has been developed as both an information

platform and a marketing platform. A total 2.07 lakh farmers have been registered under Jaivik

kheti portal.

ix. Research and Development

PKVY focusing solely on adoption of organic farming throughout the country demands a strong

foundation supported by research and development (R&D) for building on the knowledge

required to implement the right organic farming practices across different geographical

conditions prevalent throughout the length and breadth of the nation. As of now, there hasn’t been

any significant efforts that have been put in to strengthen and establish a robust R&D platform for

the scheme. However, going forward, proper scientific research backed development of organic

inputs is required in order scale up the production volume and meet the rising demand.

x. Unlocking Synergies with other government programmes

PKVY addressing the issues of soil health management by adoption of organic farming has a lot of

convergences and overlaps with a lot of other schemes.

In the case of Ganga plains, which are agriculturally most productive belt provide food for nearly

one-third of the India’s population. The farmers have gainfully utilised the potential of the Ganga

plains to cultivate their lands and raising crops in such a way, as to keep the soil alive and in good

health for a sustainable production. These areas also provide eco-friendly pollution free

environment for an organic farming system. The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development

and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWRD&GR) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the

Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfares (MoA&FW) to promote organic farming on the

banks of the Ganga in five Ganga basin states, namely Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,

Jharkhand and West Bengal. The MoA&FW released an amount of Rs. 26.49 crores. for this

purpose from the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna fund during the period of 2017-18 and 2018-19.

xi. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives (e.g.

Farmer cooperatives, FPOs, Water User Associations, etc.) and civil society in the

scheme

PKVY strongly associates itself with several local level institutions for the last mile delivery of

services. Starting from Farmer Producer Organizations (FPO) to Local Groups, PKVY entrusts the

responsibilities to be carried out for smooth functioning of its operations on a variety of such local

level collectives.

The instances where there is involvement of private sector or local level institutions in

implementation of PKVY have been listed below:

• PKVY appoints Regional Councils (RC) at district level which forms the key lever of PKVY

implementation at the grassroots level. These RCs are registered as cooperatives in the

Cooperatives act or as societies under the Societies Act.

• Existing NGOs, Organic Certification s Government, Officers of the State Department of

Agriculture, producers, consumers, traders, retailers, societies, Grama Panchayats,

Farmers and Local Groups with three years of standing in PGS programme are allowed to

register as RCs.

• An existing or a new group of farmers who adopt the organic farming practices are known

as the Local Groups (LGs). These LGs register themselves in the PGS – India certification

programme and act the last leg of implementation drivers for the PKVY.

• One of the primary components of PKVY, the Model Cluster Demonstrations, are carried

out with the involvement of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPO) who provide

supervision during the demonstrations.

• Private non-government entities (NGOs) also get involved in the implementation of PKVY

by registering themselves as RCs.

Issues and Challenges

Farmers involved in organic farming and enrolled under PKVY across different states of the

country have expressed their concerns over the proper implementation mechanism of the scheme

that is being followed at the grassroots^319. Some of the major challenges that are being faced by

the scheme are as follows:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The labelling standards in the country are not well defined leading to challenges in  
    demarcation between regular products and the organic ones. This particular issue invites

(^319) Source: https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/a-certified-problem- 58797

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

malpractices adopted in the market, leading to the actual organic producers failing to

receive the premium value of their produce^320.

1.  The designated amount of INR 1200/- per year as the remuneration of a resource person,  
    fails to provide the desired motivation to that person considering the time and effort  
    which he/she needs to put in for the role.
2.  The scheme also does not include any financial support for livestock maintenance towards  
    the farmers so that they could get vital component like cow dung, which is required for  
    organic farming.
3.  During our KII it was highlighted that when a farmer shifts to organic farming, the initial  
    yield is low and without getting the premium price the profitability remains low. Because  
    of which many farmers go back to fertiliser intensive farming

o The availability of quality inputs and organic ferlisers is low, it is difficult to judge

the quality as there are no standards in place, low quality of inputs leads to low

out

o The process of certification is very slow and costly for a farmer a good return on

investment is needed to encourage farmers to stick to organic farming.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  It was reported during the KIIs that few states are not utilizing the funds judicially and are  
    distributing the allocated funds across all districts
2.  The funds allocated for RCs fall short for the private and non-profit RCs who lack existing  
    infrastructure.
3.  The selected farmers, especially belonging to the marginalized group, have limited  
    resource to build the initial structure. Hence, the practice of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)  
    to the farmers only after the initial structure has been prepared, also poses a major  
    challenge to kick-start the activities involved.
4.  The state wise budgetary allocation towards organic farming is on the lower side, with  
    some states having less than 2% of their budget allocated towards organic farming.

C. Capacity building

1.  The trainings received by the farmers are very much theoretical and quite general in their  
    approach of learnings, lacking the required specificity in the field of organic farming. This  
    can be attributed to the limited budgetary allocation of National Centre of Organic  
    Farming (NCOF), who is responsible for the trainings.
2.  The RCs, in most of the cases have the necessary trainings on orthodox farming practices  
    involving agro chemicals and pesticides. Hence they have a very limited technical  
    knowhow on the organic methods, on which the scheme has its main focus.

The Regional Councils (RC) who are entrusted with the responsibility of implementing the

scheme at the district level, are not trained. So there is a gap which gets created when the

(^320) Source: https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/organic-farming-real-challenge-that-india-is-facing-is-  
lack-of-policy/861012/

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

RCs on the other hand organize the trainings for the cluster members and assist in PGS

certification.

D. Others

1.  There is limited availability of organic farm inputs in the country. Ranging from limited  
    organic fertilizers, there is also a significant scarcity of good quality organic seeds that can  
    be used for organic farming. As these inputs seem to vary a lot, there is a need for a policy  
    on input standardization.
2.  India lacks on the part of facilitating the farmers through a stable market of organic  
    produce. Because of this issue, the farmers quite often than not sell their produce in the  
    local markets which fetch them much lower values than what they had anticipated.
3.  Middlemen are also involved in the supply chain which again brings down the profitability  
    of the farmers, when they have no other option but to sell their produce to these  
    middlemen.
4.  There is a shortage of the infrastructure required for facilitating the storage and the  
    logistical support to the organic produce. Shortage of pack houses and refrigerated  
    vehicles result in significant spoilage while transportation.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions

The key recommendations for the scheme are provided below.

_A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism_

1.  The PGS certified products needs to be promoted among all the stakeholders including  
    end-consumers for higher acceptability and better price realization of produce for  
    farmers. PGS certified products need to be provided assured markets for sustainability  
    and maximum impact.
2.  The designated amount of INR 1200/- per year as remuneration of resource person is too  
    low, it should be revised, an appropriate monthly amount can be provided to them.
3.  The scheme should support livestock maintenance activities, maintenance of Gaushala’s  
    and vermi-composting to promote use of organic manure.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  To address these issues following steps can be taken up.

o The farmers may be provided financial support for one or two crops to cover the

losses in productivity due to organic cultivation

o Standards have to be developed for organic fertilizers and inputs to check their

quality, since quality of inputs is critical for maintaining farm productivity

o The process of organic certification needs to be streamlined, the existing central

level systems needs to support, measures are needed to ensure that the farmer

gets premium price for the certified produce

1.  As mentioned above, a total of 5.97 lakh ha area has been covered for 29,859 clusters and  
    14.93 lakh farmers have been benefitted under the scheme. Moreover, nearly six lakh  
    certificates under the PGS – India certification programme have been issued. While the  
    scheme has increased adoption of organic farming in the country, the funding allocations  
    need to be increased and utilized optimally for scheme to be effective, considering that  
    India has over 140 million ha of net sowing land.
2.  The clusters are concentrated in the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan  
    and Andhra Pradesh as these states are having the highest number of clusters formed  
    under the PKVY scheme during 2015-18. There is need to engage with some of the other  
    agrarian states such as Haryana, West Bengal, etc. considering the substantial potential  
    and opportunities.
3.  A component of gender-budgeting exists in the scheme. However, there are no specific  
    trainings offered to women to enhance their roles as decision makers which should be  
    included under the mission.
4.  The scheme allocates funds to SC/STs to ensure participation of these marginalized  
    groups in the sector. However, specific measures and awareness campaigns need to be  
    undertaken to encourage these groups to enter this sector.
5.  To scale up adoption of organic farming in the country, in addition to sensitization and  
    promotion of practices, it is important to develop innovative and scalable solutions with  
    respect to infrastructure, processing, marketing, etc. through dedicated research and  
    development in the field. It is suggested to allocate a certain proportion of funds for  
    action-oriented R&D specific to the agro-climatic conditions of the region for promotion  
    and wider implementation of organic farming.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  Clusters needs to be identified across India where fertilizer use is low and prevalence of  
    organic farming is high, these clusters should be targeted for mission activities, in addition  
    value chain studies of crops can be carried out in these clusters to identify the  
    interventions to increase profitability for farmers. Therefore, it is important that the funds  
    utilized by the states are allocated after identification of clusters for promotion and  
    implementation of organic farming.
2.  The funds requirement for smooth functioning of private and non-profit RCs needs to be  
    assessed and appropriately revised

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  Initial support needs to be provided for farmers who are adapting to organic farming, the  
    utility and constraints faced in transferring the funds through DBT can be assessed and  
    the process may be appropriately modified
2.  The states who are actively supporting organic farming may be selected for support  
    through the scheme. The utilization of funds under PKVY have been over 90% on an  
    average over last 4 years. However, the state wise budgetary allocation towards organic  
    farming is on the lower side, with some states having less than 2% of their budget  
    allocated towards organic farming. Therefore, promotion and adoption of organic farming  
    needs to be encourage from stakeholders at state level as well.
3.  As organic farming needs to be encouraged on priority basis throughout the country,  
    specific budgets need to be allocated for deputing required dedicated officers for  
    promotion of organic farming in the states and districts. Moreover, markets need to be  
    established and promoted for sale of organic produce directly to consumers.

C. Capacity building

The training and capacity building of the farmers needs to include field level aspects of

organic farming and support required to sustain. These activities need to be

supplemented with exposure visits to model farms. Therefore, the frequency of training

programs need to be increased and made more interactive in order to engage with

farmers for higher participation.

1.  For improvement of the knowledge of RCs, periodical training courses need to be  
    organized on organic farming practices and improved measures that can be implemented  
    at the field level.
2.  There is need to focus on development of marketing opportunities for better price  
    realization to farmers along with promotion of production.
3.  The development of supporting infrastructure is important for reduction in wastages of  
    organic produce, as long duration for transportation and lack of storage, etc. lead to  
    wastage of produce and discourage farmers involved in organic farming.
4.  PKVY should adequately focus on training with respect to budgets, specific skills and  
    demonstrations and involve expert farmers for large-scale structured interventions. The  
    scheme should ensure adequate support for off-farm and on-farm inputs for effective  
    conversion to organic farming practices without risking yields. It must push for pesticide  
    residue testing, which will give the necessary weightage to product testing aspect of the  
    certification.
5.  FSSAI should set the standards for pesticide residues in organic foods and ensure  
    surveillance. Labelling provisions should be introduced based on compliance with organic  
    process and pesticide testing in products.

D. Others

1.  Policy and legislation is in need for standardization of organic inputs and their production  
    to ensure quality.
2.  Effective certification and marketing of the produce is needed financial analysis can be  
    done to check the price premium needed for maintaining profitability of interventions,  
    accordingly support can be provided to farmers for initial years. Focus must be on the

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

develop a market for organic produce and identify buyers who would be able to purchase

the product at premium.

1.  Value chain assessment can be done for maximizing profits of farmers, options to link  
    production clusters directly with retailers can also be explored
2.  The farmers do not have any incentives while sifting from their mainstream chemical  
    based farming practices to organic methods, which witnesses a decline in their produce.  
    Infrastructure gaps can be identified through commissioning value chain studies, the  
    interventions can then be prioritized and developed. This studies can be financed at  
    central level.

E. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  The output indicators do not cover some of the components of the scheme such as  
    progress on Integrated Manure management, Custom Hiring Centres, Packing, labelling  
    and branding of produce, among others, which need to be included.
2.  With respect to the outcome indicators, the indicators do not cover some of the objectives  
    and intended outcomes of the scheme such as reduction in cost of agriculture to farmers  
    through sustainable integrated organic farming systems, increase in farmer’s income,  
    market linkages established at local as well as national market levels for the farmers,  
    promotion of entrepreneurship, etc.
3.  The scheme has performed satisfactorily, however, performance is not measured for  
    output and outcome indicators on a yearly basis. It is recommended that the output and  
    outcome indicators are revised and performance is monitored on a periodic basis.
4.  The planned centralized MIS (snapshot below) for the PKVY to track the progress across  
    the physical as well as the financial yardsticks for the clusters which have been geo-tagged  
    should be made operational on a priority basis for effective monitoring. The same can also  
    be integrated with implementation of MOVCD-NER to track overall progress of organic  
    farming in the country.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

PKVY promotes sustainable organic cultivation practices and helps in reducing the

dependence on chemical fertilisers for agricultural production. This is an important

scheme for promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Therefore, it should be

continued, however, more focus should be given on increasing price premium for

farmers after sale of organic produce.

It is also suggested that support may be provided to farmers in the initial years as

viability gap funding to sustain operations. Moreover, certification process needs to be

streamlined.

2.2.15 Sub-Mission on Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine

Background of the Scheme

The Sub-Mission on Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine (SMPPQ) under National Mission on

Agricultural Extension and Technology (NMAET) is a scheme through which regulatory,

monitoring, surveillance and capacity building functions are performed. It is a Central Sector

scheme with a budget of Rs. 1,315.02 crore for three years, i.e., 2017-18 to 2019- 20321.

**Objectives of the Sub Mission**

The primary aim of this Sub Mission is to minimize loss to quality and yield of agricultural crops

from the ravages of insect pests, diseases, weeds, nematodes, rodents, etc. and to shield

agricultural bio-security from the incursions and spread of alien species. The Sub-Mission also

seeks to facilitate exports of Indian agricultural commodities to global markets and to promote

good agricultural practices, particularly with respect to plant protection strategies and

techniques.

**Components of the Sub-Mission**

1.  Strengthening and Modernization of Pest Management Approach in India (SMPMA)

a. Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

b. Locust Control and Research

c. Implementation of Insecticide Act, 1968

1.  Strengthening and Modernization of Plant Quarantine Facilities in India (SMPQF)
2.  Monitoring of Pesticide Residue at National Level (MPRNL)
3.  National Institute of Plant Health Management (NIPHM)

**Organisational structure of Sub-mission**

The organizational structure of the sub-mission is given below:

**Implementation structure and stakeholders**

The organization implementation structure is available on public domain only for Monitoring of

Pest Residues at National Level (MPRNL) component.

MPRNL is monitored by two committees, namely, Steering Committee and Technical Committee.

The policy decisions related to the scheme are under the purview of the Steering Committee

headed by the Joint Secretary (Plant Protection), Department of Agriculture, Cooperation &

Farmers Welfare and the Technical Committee, headed by the Assistant Director General (Plant

Protection), Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) related to the technical issues. The

Project Coordinating Cell of All India Network Project (AINP) on Pesticide Residues is the nodal

center for implementation of the scheme. The Network Coordinator, AINP on Pesticide Residues,

IARI, New Delhi is the Member Secretary of the scheme and is the nodal person for the day to day

implementation of the scheme related to financial and technical matters and submission of

monthly report, annual report and need based information to the Department of Agriculture,

Cooperation & Farmers Welfare.

**Intended sectoral performance**

Chemical pesticides played a major role in minimizing the crop loss due to pests & diseases.

However, indiscriminate and non-judicious use of chemical pesticides in agriculture has resulted

in several associated adverse effects such as destruction of bio-control agents, development of

resistance in pests, pest resurgence, human and animal health hazards, pesticides residues in

food, fruits and vegetables, fodder, soil and water, ecological imbalances and environmental

pollution etc. Therefore, the primary aim of this Sub Mission is to minimize loss to quality and

yield of agricultural crops from the ravages of insect pests, diseases, weeds, nematodes, rodents,

etc. and to shield our agricultural bio-security from the incursions and spread of alien species. The

Sub Mission also seeks to facilitate exports of Indian agricultural commodities to global markets

and to promote good agricultural practices, particularly with respect to plant protection

strategies and techniques.

The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) promotes IPM

through 35 Central Integrated Pest Management Centres (CIPMCs) located in 29 States and one

Union Territory. The mandate of these Centres is pest/disease monitoring, production and release

of biocontrol agents, conservation of bio-control agents and Human Resource Development in

IPM by imparting training to Agricultural Extension Officers and farmers at the grassroots levels

by organizing Farmers' Field Schools (FFSs) in the farmers’ fields.

The data generated by the scheme, particularly MPRNL, helps in focusing governmental

interventions such as integrated pest management (IPM) and other suitable measures in regions

of high prevalence of pesticide residues. This programme helps the authorities at various levels

to sensitize the stake holders on pesticide use / safe use, pesticide residue and food safety, and

regulatory issues related to pesticide residues. The data includes the status of pesticide load in

various food commodities, usage of recommended/ non-recommended pesticides by the farmers

and sharing of monitoring data with state agricultural department for necessary corrective action.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

The scheme aligns with the National Development Agenda of Doubling Farmers’ Income: Policy &

Governance. The scheme provides policy support to the government in various sectors of plant

protection, including Integrated Pest Management (IPM), pesticide management, plant

quarantine, bio-security and market access issues. This will ensure crop safety and hence income

security for farmers. It also contributes to SDG 2a, which seeks to forge research practices through

human resource development, both in public and private sector, covering areas, inter-alia, of plant

protection technology, plant quarantine and bio-security, crop oriented Integrated Pest

Management approaches, and quality testing of pesticides.

(^322) Ready Reckoner Plant Protection I (IPM Unit), DAC&FW

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Crop yield increased from 6.72 – 40.14% in rice and 22.7 – 26.63% in cotton in IPM fields

compared to non-IPM fields.

• Chemical pesticide sprays were reduced to the extent of 50-100% in rice and 29.96 to

50.5% in cotton.

• The scheme remains relevant in terms of encouraging environmentally sustainable plant

health management methods in diverse and shifting agro-climatic circumstances.

However, the scheme’s objectives are similar to other existing schemes like Mission

Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region, and Paramparagat Krishi

Vikas Yojana (PKVY), hence rationalization of these schemes could bring synergies and

make these schemes more effective.

**Observations:**

• There is a mismatch between the targets and achievements mentioned in the Scheme

Rationalization document of NITI Aayog and Department’s sources.

• As per the output indicator based progress, there has been under-achievement of targets

in 2018-19, especially in the “Area over which pest incidence is being monitored” and

“Area over which augmentation and conservation initiated”.

**Progress under MPRNL**

• 32 functioning laboratories as of December 2019

• 23,660 samples analysed (2017-18)

• Fixation of 19 Codex MRL (Maximum Residue Limit) on spices based on monitoring data

generated under MRL (2012-17)

• 12 Refresher Group training programmes conducted by Project Coordinating Cell, IARI

(2012-19)

Major achievement of MPRNL

• A major achievement of the scheme is the fixation of 19 Codex MRL (Maximum Residue

Limit) on spices.

− The Codex Alimentarius, or "Food Code" is a collection of standards, guidelines and

codes of practice adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, a Commission

jointly set up by FAO and WHO.

− Codex standards ensure that food is safe and can be traded.

− Setting of codex by Indian standards would hence ensure that the average pesticide

levels found in the commodities would be acceptable for international trade.

The progress on the outcome indicators is not available.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• Chemical pesticides played a major role in minimizing the crop loss due to pests &

diseases. However, indiscriminate and non-judicious use of chemical pesticides in

agriculture has resulted in several associated adverse effects. Therefore, the primary aim

of this SMPPQ is to minimize loss to quality and yield of agricultural crops from the

ravages of insect pests, diseases, weeds, nematodes, rodents, etc. and to shield our

agricultural bio-security from the incursions and spread of alien species.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• The scheme is highly relevant for better and effective regulation of the increasing use

through monitoring, checks and controls and promotion of IPM practices to optimize the

yearly increase in pesticide consumption.

• The data generated by the scheme, particularly MPRNL, helps in focusing governmental

interventions such as integrated pest management (IPM) and other suitable measures in

regions of high prevalence of pesticide residues. This programme helps the authorities at

various levels to sensitize the stake holders on pesticide use / safe use, pesticide residue

and food safety, and regulatory issues related to pesticide residues.

• The scheme aligns with the National Development Agenda of Doubling Farmers’ Income:

Policy & Governance. The scheme provides policy support to the government in various

sectors of plant protection, including Integrated Pest Management (IPM), pesticide

management, plant quarantine, bio-security and market access issues.

**Effectiveness**

• As per the output indicators based progress, there has been under-achievement of targets

in 2018-19, especially in the “Area over which pest incidence is being monitored” and

“Area over which augmentation and conservation initiated”.

**Efficiency**

• Based on the estimates available, the budgeted estimates have increased till 2018-19,

however, there has been significant reduction in revised estimates for the scheme in

2018 - 19.

• About 73% of the allocated funds were utilized in 2017-18.

**Sustainability**

• The scheme encourages environmentally sustainable plant health management methods

in diverse and shifting agro-climatic circumstances. However, the scheme’s objectives are

similar to other existing schemes like Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North

Eastern Region and Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY).

**Impact**

• A major achievement of the scheme is the fixation of 19 Codex MRL (Maximum Residue

Limit) on spices. Therefore, as an impact, this will ensure that the food is safe and can be

traded ensuring that the average pesticide levels found in the commodities would be

acceptable for international trade.

**Equity**

• SMPPQ has no gender specific components. The relevance of gender mainstreaming is

minimal in the scheme.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas**

i. Accountability and transparency

The implementation structure and stakeholders for IPM are not available on public domain. For

MPRNL, implementation and monitoring are carried out by two committees, Steering Committee

and Technical Committee. The policy decisions related to the scheme are under the purview of

the Steering Committee and the Technical Committee oversees the aspects related to technical

issues. The Project Coordinating Cell of All India Network Project (AINP) on Pesticide Residues is

the nodal center for implementation of the scheme. It supervises day-to-day implementation of

the scheme related to financial and technical matters and submission of monthly report, annual

report and need based information to the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers

Welfare.

ii. Gender Mainstreaming

SMPPQ has no gender specific components. The relevance of gender mainstreaming is minimal in

the schemes.

iii. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient

practices & diversifications

Both IPM and MPRNL seek to minimize use of pesticides and promote organic farming and use of

bio-fertilisers. The schemes hence promote climate-friendly practices. Under the umbrella SMPPQ

scheme, financial assistance is provided to the States for establishing/ strengthening of Pesticide

testing, bio-pesticides testing and Bio-control laboratory. The Umbrella scheme includes

component for creation of an environment impact study cell, to examine the impact of pesticides

on the environment, and the mitigation measures wherever possible.

iv. Use of IT/technology in driving efficiency

The participating centres under MPRNL have been accredited by National Accreditation Board for

Testing and Calibration of Laboratories (NABL) in the field of chemical testing as per ISO/IEC

17025:2005 to ensure the generation of authentic data. The laboratories are hence updated with

latest technology and machines.

v. Development, dissemination & adoption of innovative practices, technology & know-

how

A unique feature of the scheme is the setting up of IPM Seva Kendras for production and making

available of IPM inputs like bio-control agents, light traps, rodent traps, Pheromone traps, Sticky

traps, Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (NPV), bird perture, seed treatment drum, Neem seed Kernal

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

extract (NSKE), cattle dung, ash etc. to the farmers. This not only enables easy access to IPM

inputs, but also promotes entrepreneurship among farmers.

Box 9 : Pest infestation prediction for farmers

Case Study: Pest infestation prediction for farmers

Introduction/Challenge:

Pests can cause damage to plants, humans, structures, and other creatures, including crops

that are grown for food. The destruction not only threatens production, but also impact

farmer income.

Solution:

Microsoft collaborated with United Phosphorous (UPL), India’s largest producer of

agrochemicals to create an API which can indicate in advance the risk of pest attack. The Pest

Risk Prediction API enables farmers to get predictive insights on the possibility of pest

infestation.

In the first phase, about 3,000 marginal farmers with less than five acres of land holding in 50

villages across in Telangana, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh received automated voice calls

for their cotton crops. The calls indicated the risk of pest attacks based on weather conditions

and crop stage in addition to the sowing advisories. The risk classification is High, Medium and

Low, specific for each district in each state.

Impact:

This technology has empowered farmers to plan in advance, reducing crop loss due to pests

and thereby helping them to double the farm income. In addition AI-based sowing advisories

led to 30% higher yields, as the farmers are getting regular updates on possible pest infestation

they are able to plan their activities better. Taking queue from the intervention, the

Government of Karnataka is working towards predictive analysis for price forecasting.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The discussion of the cross sectional thematic areas for the scheme has been summarized below:

Issues and Challenges

Some of the major issues and challenges in the Scheme are as follows:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The information availability with regards to the scheme on the public domain is limited.  
    For example, no information was available on activities undertaken for research &  
    development under the scheme, which is an important component to ensure that  
    mitigation measures are in place for new pests, diseases, etc. Similarly, there is no  
    information available on the impact of training of farmers on the use of bio-fertilisers, bio-  
    pesticides, etc., or the changes undertaken in policy framework as a result of availability  
    of reliable data on presence of pesticide residues.
2.  Another anomaly noted was that the scheme is a Central Sector scheme, and not a  
    Centrally Sponsored Scheme (except IPM). The scheme needs to be aligned under the right  
    budget head.

B. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  As mentioned earlier, there is a mismatch between the targets and achievements  
    mentioned in the Scheme Rationalization document of NITI Aayog and Department’s  
    sources. As per the output indicator based progress, there has been under-achievement  
    of targets in 2018-19, especially in the “Area over which pest incidence is being  
    monitored” and “Area over which augmentation and conservation initiated”. The progress  
    as per the Ministry’s indicators has been satisfactory.

C. Convergence with other schemes and programs

1.  The umbrella scheme SMPPQ consists of four components, all of which are working as  
    independent schemes. While there is overlap among the components and there is

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

relevance of functioning the four schemes together, there needs to be more convergence

between the four in terms of testing facilities, technology at laboratories, etc.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the key recommendations for the scheme:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The information regarding schemes and progress of its components should be provided  
    on the public domain
2.  As the scheme is Central Sector Scheme it should be put in appropriate budget head.
3.  It is necessary to upgrade existing knowledge about climate change effects on pests,  
    diseases and food-borne pathogens and, where possible, for research to be undertaken  
    collaboratively at, for example, regional level. Thus, it is necessary to raise R&D and  
    capacity building efforts to continually upgrade knowledge about climate change effects  
    on pests, diseases and food-borne pathogens and food safety. Novel approaches, such as  
    the establishment of regional laboratories or centers of excellence should be explored  
    to save resources and facilitate cooperation, where possible. International solidarity to  
    fight serious plant pest outbreaks such as locust control needs to be also strongly focused  
    upon and continually strengthened through collaborative and multilateral surveillance  
    programme to timely offset such threats and implement contingency / emergency  
    measures. SPS issues in relation to climate change must be given a higher standing in the  
    general policy consideration for climate change.

B. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  There appears to be a mismatch between the targets and achievements mentioned in the  
    Scheme Rationalization document of NITI Aayog and Department’s sources. As per the  
    output indicator based progress, there has been under-achievement of targets in 2018-  
    19, especially in the “Area over which pest incidence is being monitored” and “Area over  
    which augmentation and conservation initiated”. Moreover, the progress on the outcome  
    indicators is not available. Thus output/ outcome indicators developed for the scheme  
    should be properly tracked and reported to ensure consistency for effective progress  
    tracking.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  Secondly, the current output and outcome indicators tracks limited aspects of scheme  
    implementation and may expanded to evaluate the scheme performance in holistic terms.  
    For example, in addition to the area coverage, the output indicator framework may also  
    consider the following indicators

o no. of capacity building programmes conducted for farmers (through Farmer Field

School) and institutional staff (for executing various IPM activities),

o contingency plan developed for priority pests/ to address the commodity-specific

requirement

o trained manpower availability

o area expansion achieved,

o increase in border line infrastructure establishment/upgradation

o MRL developed for priority focus crop,

o % increase and reduction in non-compliance, market access, export certification

etc.

Similarly, the outcome indicators that may be mapped in addition to existing ones may

include

o increase in adoption of IPM practices

o improvement in crop productivity and competitiveness due to improved plant

health/ pest management

o reductions in number / response time to an incursion/ quarantine cases

o reduction in impact of the prioritized pest and diseases on the environment,

economy and community

o minimization of disruptions/ restrictions in market access etc.

C. Convergence

1.  Convergences with other schemes and programmes such as MoFPI scheme for Setting  
    Up/Up-gradation of Quality Control/Food Testing Laboratories, APEDA scheme for  
    Quality & export infrastructure Development, FSSAI should be leveraged build the  
    diagnostic capacity such as MoFPI scheme for Setting Up/Up-gradation of Quality  
    Control/Food Testing Laboratories.

D. Capacity building

1.  The scheme is highly relevant for better and effective regulation of the increasing use  
    through monitoring, checks and controls and promotion of IPM practices to optimize the  
    yearly increase in pesticide consumption.
2.  Apart from capacity building of farmers through field schools, and strengthening of  
    institutional resources (such as through training extension functionaries & infrastructure  
    support)- the scheme should also focus on sensitization and capacity building of private  
    sector stakeholders such as input distributors/ handler/ distribution agents/ traders/  
    exporters etc. with respect to safe use and storage of chemicals, adherence to norms of

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

residual levels, compliance with international standards for phyto-sanitary measures &

certifications etc.

1.  Besides, the scheme should also focus upon building public-private partnership /  
    collaborations so that the execution of phyto-sanitary measures and capacities may be  
    extended beyond the scope of scheme. An in-depth stakeholder analysis may be  
    undertaken to develop an understanding of how each stakeholder might influence the  
    outcome of the project and their stage and level of engagement.

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

This scheme is now sub-mission of the National Mission on Agricultural Extension and

Technology (NMAET). The Scheme guidelines of NMAET mention that the common

threads running across all 4 Sub-Missions are Extension & Technology. The scheme

aims to restructure & strengthen agricultural extension to enable delivery of appropriate

technology and improved agronomic practices to the farmers. This is envisaged to be

achieved by:

*   A mix of physical outreach & interactive methods of information  
    dissemination
*   Use of ICT
*   Popularization of modern and appropriate technologies
*   Capacity building and institution strengthening to promote mechanization
*   Availability of quality seeds, plant protection etc.
*   Encourage the aggregation of farmers into Interest Groups (FIGs) to form  
    Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

2.2.16 Sub Mission on Agroforestry (SMAF)

Background of the Scheme

In order to make agriculture less vulnerable to climatic aberrations, Government of India

formulated the National Agroforestry Policy in 2014. The policy recommends for setting up of a

Mission or Board to address development of agroforestry sector in an organised manner. To take

forward the policy recommendations, an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) was constituted

under the Chairmanship of Secretary (AC&FW). Since establishment of a mission / board for

agroforestry was one of the major recommendations of the policy, the idea of sub-mission on

agroforestry was conceived under the ambit of NMSA. The aim of the submission is to expand the

tree coverage on farmland in complementary with agricultural crops. The implementation will

help in increasing income, increased tree cover and higher carbon sequestration for climate

change adaptation and mitigation^323.

The scheme is being implemented in the States which have liberalized transit regulations for

selected tree species. At present scheme is being implemented in 21 States namely i.e. Meghalaya,

Mizoram, Nagaland, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,

Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab,

Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.

**Objectives**

• To encourage and expand tree plantation in complementary and integrated manner with

crops and livestock, to improve productivity, employment opportunities, income

generation and livelihoods of rural households, especially the small farmers.

• To ensure availability of quality planting material like seeds, seedlings, clones, hybrids,

improved varieties, etc.

• To popularise various Agroforestry practices/models suitable to different agro ecological

regions and land use conditions.

• To create database, information and knowledge support in the area of agroforestry.

• To provide extension and capacity building support to agroforestry sector.

**Components**

• Nursery development for quality planting material (NDQPM)

• Peripheral and boundary plantation (PBP)

• Low density plantation on farm land (LDPFL)

• High density block plantation (HDBP)

• Capacity building and trainings

• Demonstration of agroforestry models

**Implementation structure and stakeholders**

In terms of implementation, states need to prepare an Action Plan for development on cluster-

basis, indicating the year-wise activities and corresponding fund requirement spread across four

(^323) https://nmsa.dac.gov.in/pdfdoc/Agroforestory\_Guidelines\_English.pdf

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

years. Since the project proposals of each year will have residual activities for the remaining three

years, the annual action plan for a specific year need to be planned in such a manner that the year

wise phased activities of the approved projects are properly provisioned during assessment of

fund requirement. The project proposals for plantation measures in selected clusters, nursery

development and other activities need to be developed involving district and state level

committees as envisaged in NMSA Guidelines and submitted to the Government of India for

approval of Project Sanctioning Committee. Soil Health Cards is a pre-requisite for farmers in

getting the benefit of the programme. The plantation measures would be planned based on the

soil health parameters and also this will help in monitoring soil carbon improvement from time

to time. In order to motivate the farmers to take up tree plantation on farm land, relaxation of

existing policy and regulatory framework is to be finalized by the states concerned. At the first

instance the programme will only be implemented in the states those have liberalized the transit

regulations for transport of timber. Liberal transit rules will be a precondition for availing the

benefit of the program. States are given the flexibility to implement the programme at field level

by using the services of existing extension system. However, states may engage additional human

resources like consultants, extension personnel and other supporting staff for specific tasks

purely on contractual basis as per Guidelines of NMSA.

**Intended contribution to sectoral performance**

Substantial area in the country is still dependant on rainfall for farming. Due to the changing

climatic pattern, rainfall is becoming more erratic, making cultivation a high risk and less

productive profession over the years. It has therefore, becoming increasingly difficult for the

majority of the Indian farmers to sustain their farm production, productivity and income.

Agroforestry has the potential to mitigate the climate change effects through microclimate

moderation, conservation of natural resources and creation of additional source of livelihood and

income opportunities. Agroforestry not only provides environmental services, but also economic

gains, as about 65 % of the country’s timber requirement is met from the trees grown outside

forests. Agro forestry products are also known to enrich soil nutrients. Hence, adoption of agro

forestry can not only sustain farmers during seasons of low productivity (due to inadequate or

excess rainfall), but can also be a means to complement their income as agro forestry products

have a higher market value due to their commercial nature. The mission is focused to achieve the

quantifiable benefits such as increase tree cover to enhance carbon sequestration, enrichment of

soil organic matter, availability of quality planting material, improvement in livelihood, and

productivity enhancement of crop and cropping systems.

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

The Mission has high relevance in meeting National Development Agenda as it focusses on making

agriculture more remunerative for farmers as agro forestry products have a higher market value

due to their commercial nature. Additionally, these products can sustain extreme temperature

changes compared to crops, making them more disaster resilient (for e.g., in case of inadequate

or excessive rainfall). The Mission also enables crop diversification.

It has relevance to UN SDG of No Poverty and Zero Hunger as well. Making agriculture more

remunerative through sowing of agro-forestry products (teakwood, plywood, sandalwood, etc.)

can complement the incomes of farmers. The additional income is especially important in case of

low income from agricultural produce. Given their higher resistance to extreme temperatures,

SMAF can contribute to Goal 2.4 of UN SDG, viz., “By 2030, ensure sustainable food production

systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production,

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme

weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil

quality.” This also similarly contributes to SDG 13 of Climate Action. The Mission thus contributes

to following SDGs:

Goal 1- No Poverty - Making agriculture more remunerative

Goal 2- Zero Hunger – Promoting sustainable food production systems

Goal 13 – Climate Action – Enriching soil nutrients, disaster resilient products

In a nutshell, SMAF contributes to following national and international goals:

**Observations:**

• Revised Estimates are half of Budget Estimates.

• Expenditure, allocation, and release data indicates low financial utilization

• Until 2018-19 more than Rs. 92 crores have been released for the scheme of which only

Rs. 7.8 crores has been spent.

• KIIs revealed that the scheme hasn’t taken off as farmers are unwilling to substitute crops

with agro forestry products as they take longer time to mature. For example, Teak is one

of the faster growing tropical hardwoods, yet, it takes 20 to 25 years to grow into a mature

tropical tree to final harvest.

— Indian farmers, most of whom have small landholdings and limited income, are not

willing to wait long durations to monetize their produce, and hence are unwilling to

cultivate agro forestry products.

these trainings seems insufficient.

• Less than 25% of the targeted nurseries have been set up.

• KIIs indicated that the scheme hasn’t taken off as farmers are unwilling to substitute crops

70000 68617

Source: Scheme Rationalization document as shared by NITI Aayog

Here also, it is evident that although the number of farmers trained is significant (vis-à-vis the

target) however, adoption of agro-forestry as a practice has been limited (about 12% of the target

achieved in terms of additional area covered under green cover. Moreover, the outcome

indicators are also not aligned to the output indicators. For example, outcome indicator is no. of

farmers trained whereas the output indicator is no. of trainings held. In this case, the outcome

indicator should have been the no. of farmers adopting agroforestry practices after attending the

trainings.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• Agroforestry has the potential to mitigate the climate change effects through microclimate

moderation, conservation of natural resources and creation of additional source of

livelihood and income opportunities. Agroforestry not only provides environmental

services, but also economic gains, as about 65 % of the country’s timber requirement is

met from the trees grown outside forests.

• The mission has high relevance in meeting National Development Agenda as it focusses

on making agriculture more remunerative for farmers as agro forestry products have a

higher market value due to their commercial nature. Additionally, these products can

sustain extreme temperature changes compared to crops, making them more disaster

resilient.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Effectiveness**

• While a significant number of training, seminar and awareness building campaigns have

been conducted under the Scheme, however, the achievement of output indicators in

terms of extent of tree plantation, support infrastructure (nursery) establishment,

production capacity for quality planting material etc. remains low.

• Barely one percent of the annual target for planting of trees has been achieved in 2018-

19 and less than 25% of the targeted nurseries have been set up.

**Efficiency**

• Revised estimates are half of budgeted estimates. Expenditure, allocation and release data

indicates low utilization.

• Until 2018-19 more than Rs. 92 crores have been released for the scheme of which only

Rs. 7.8 crores has been spent.

**Sustainability**

• The scheme hasn’t taken off as it has been reported that farmers are unwilling to

substitute crops with agro forestry products as they take longer time to mature.

**Impact**

• Unlike agriculture and horticulture, there has been a lack of price supportive mechanism

for farm grown trees. Fair and transparent pricing mechanism of farm grown trees is

largely absent as also price safety nets like MSPs for grains etc.

• Studies reveal that these agroforestry systems have the potential to generate employment

opportunities of 450 man-days per hectare per year. The scheme, however, does not

currently track the employment generated through scheme interventions.

**Equity**

• The scheme guidelines stipulate that at least 50% of the allocation is to be utilized for

small, marginal farmers of which at least 30% should be women beneficiaries/ farmers.

However, there are no budget allocation for women beneficiaries

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas

i. Accountability and transparency

In terms of accountability, year-wise activities are approved as per Action Plans developed on

cluster-basis. The activities and corresponding fund requirement are spread across four years.

The project proposals for plantation measures in selected clusters, nursery development and

other activities need to be developed involving district and state level committees and submitted

to the Government of India for approval of Project Sanctioning Committee. Forest Departments

are generally the project implementing agency. State Forest Department, if they are not the

implementing department, is required to be actively associated in planning & implementation of

the programme.

In terms of transparency, any procurement / purchases / auctions, etc. is undertaken strictly

through e-procurement process following General Financial Rules. Wherever feasible, during

transfer of assistance particularly for farmer centric activities, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is

adopted. The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this

scheme:

• The data availability for the scheme was satisfactory. The information available on public

domain included scheme guidelines, year-wise allocation, release and expenditure of

funds, year-wise physical and financial achievement, and release of funds for General, and

SC/ST beneficiaries. The said data was available state-wise as well.

• Scheme guidelines stipulate mid-term and end-term evaluation of the scheme. However,

given that the scheme is yet to take-off as desired, there have been no evaluation as of

date.

• No social audit has been undertaken for the scheme.

• For monitoring, MIS and periodic assessment using GIS is adopted.

• The digital location of the cluster with the attributes of interventions like plantation area,

number of plants, name of beneficiaries, details of nurseries, project cost etc is also

supposed to be uploaded in the Bhuvan Platform. However, data is not updated on the

portal, and is available for only a few states.

Figure 184 : Snapshot of Bhuvan portal

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Grievances are handled via CPGRAM and RTIs but have been limited in number.

• Funds are released to State Nodal Department or designated implementing agency as

notified by the State. State Level Implementing Agency ensures implementation in a time

bound manner in accordance with their approved Annual Action Plan. Funds are released

in instalments based on physical & financial progress report, submission of utilization

certificates and other necessary documents as per provisions of General Financial Rules,

specific emergent need etc.

• Funds are transferred through DBT.

ii. Direct/Indirect employment generation

One of the objectives of the Mission is to expand employment opportunities. Studies reveal that

these agroforestry systems have the potential to generate employment opportunities of 450 man-

days per hectare per year^326. The scheme, however, does not currently track the employment

generated.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The scheme does not monitor the level of employment generated even though

employment generation is one of its objectives.

• Several studies have indicate the huge potential of generating employment through agro

forestry systems. For instance, a study estimated that agroforestry systems have the

potential to generate employment opportunities of 450 man-days per hectare per year.

• There is substantial potential for employment generation through the Mission.

− Practicing of agroforestry can result in increased self-employment opportunities

through interventions such as nursery raising, mat weaving, basket making etc.

− Employment may also be generated through plantation, processing, and utilization

marketing.

However, as the scheme’s progress has been quite limited, the employment generation may not

have happened in line with the potential.

iii. Gender Mainstreaming

The scheme guidelines stipulate that at least 50% of the allocation is to be utilized for small,

marginal farmers of which at least 30% should be women beneficiaries/ farmers.

As per data on the NMSA website, there were only 1,784 women beneficiaries (2014-20) (about

14.8%) against 10,199 male beneficiaries, however, the data does not capture all states.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The Mission incorporates allocation to women (30% of the 50% allocation earmarked for

small, marginal farmers) to encourage their participation in the Mission.

• There are no budget allocation for women beneficiaries.

• However, no other concrete steps are taken to ensure women participation in the Mission.

• There is no specific mention of support to women SHGs as well.

iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient

practices & diversifications

Agroforestry is known to have the potential to mitigate the climate change effects through

microclimate moderation, conservation of natural resources and creation of additional source of

livelihood and income opportunities. The guidelines stipulate that specific demonstration

projects be taken up in the field of climate resilient agro forestry systems. A study published in

International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences concluded that total carbon

sequestration potential (CSP) varied from 0.032 to 1.849 million tonnes carbon and total CSP of

all 15 analysed states come out to be 7.230 million tonnes carbon.

Table 111 : Agroforestry area, and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) in different states

Agroforestry, November 2019

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

It is noteworthy that higher area under agro forestry does not automatically translate into higher

CSP. However, it is one of the factors at play for higher CSP.

As the scheme’s progress has been quite limited, its contribution to climate mitigation may not

have been in line with the potential.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the

scheme in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

In accordance with the decision of the Government of India regarding implementation of Special

Component Plan (SCP) for Scheduled Castes and Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) for Scheduled Tribes, 16%

of the total allocation for SCP and 8% for TSP have been earmarked. However, states are allowed

to make allocation to SC/ST farmers proportionate to their population in the States/districts.

vi. Development, dissemination & adoption of innovative practices, technology & know-

how

The Mission includes an intervention for undertaking demonstration on area specific innovative

agroforestry models by SAUs / ICAR Institutes/ CAUs/CSIR/ICFRE institutes / State Government/

other National & International level agencies/ organizations. It encourages demonstrations

particularly in the field of climate resilient agroforestry system, as well as studies on carbon

footprint, carbon sequestration, nitrogen fixation etc., with the approval of Project Sanctioning

Committee.

In addition, regular training and capacity building activities are undertaken as part of the Mission.

States can utilise upto 5% of the allocated funds for capacity building and training activities.

Activities like training of farmers/field workers, skill development, awareness campaign,

publications, documentation, exposure visits, seminars/workshops, conferences etc. are

supported under the Mission. However, as mentioned earlier, the trainings and demonstrations

have not yet been able to motivate farmers to adopt agroforestry in a large scale.

vii. Research & Development

SMAF calls for regular research on new models of agro forestry, hence, R&D is a critical

component of the Mission. The Mission has linkages with various institutes of ICAR/SAUs/

National / International Institutes. The Central Agroforestry Research Institute (CAFRI), ICAR,

and the South Asia Regional Programme of World Agroforestry, jointly published a book,

_Successful agroforestry models for different agro-ecological regions in India_ , which contained a

comprehensive account of 40 successfully tested agroforestry systems for 20 different agro-

ecological regions in India. In addition, ICAR has published other papers on the topic, including,

_Promising Agroforestry Tree Species in India_ and _Guidelines to Produce Quality Planting Material of_

_Agroforestry Species_. Under the Mission, SAUs / ICAR Institutes/ CAUs/CSIR/ICFRE institutes /

State Government/ other National & International level agencies/ organizations are encouraged

to undertake projects for demonstration and extension purposes on area specific innovative

agroforestry models.

**_viii. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives and civil_**

society in the scheme

India has an ambitious target of having 33% of its geographical area under forest cover but with

increasing pressure of development activities, it has not been easy. A report by an expert

committee formed by the environment ministry for suggesting strategies for increasing green

cover outside recorded forest areas has made a series of recommendations to achieve the goal^327.

It suggests a significant involvement of the private sector in the effort including recommendations

like leasing out of wasteland to the corporate sector for re-greening it. However, SMAF lacks

sufficient incentives to the private sector, or cooperatives to invest in the sector.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• Private sector, NGOs, cooperatives can play a critical role in achieving the country’s target

of having 33% of its geographical area under forest cover.

(^327) Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Leasing of Degraded Forest Lands, Working Group’s  
report on the prospects of making degraded forests available to private entrepreneurs, 2010

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Agroforestry in India is expected to benefit from public private partnerships in areas of

technology development and dissemination, especially for planting materials, processing,

extension services and market information.

• The private sector is also seen as having a key role in providing institutional credit and

insurance cover for agroforestry and in mobilizing dedicated producer organizations to

take up agro forestry on a large scale.

• Private sector can play an important role in development of hi-tech nurseries, promoting

traditional agro forestry-related activities like weaving, basket making, etc.

• Our KII discussions highlighted that it is assumed that the private sector will enter on its

own if it finds it economically attractive to invest in the sector, and hence no special

incentives are inbuilt in the Mission.

• The private sector can also upscale the sector by making it more commercially attractive

for farmers. For instance, partnering directly with farmers and communicating in advance

their demand for plywood, timber, poplar, teakwood, etc. so that farmers can cultivate

these as per market demand.

• Also, private sector or start-ups, or cooperatives may be able to discover alternative uses

of wood logs that does not meet their standard/quality norms.

Discussion on sector-specific thematic assessment

Agro forestry is known to enrich soil nutrients. This can be especially useful for utilization of

fallow land or reclamation of degraded land. Traditionally, farmers have used the practice of

"fallow" to allow crop land to rest without crops and be rejuvenated naturally. When the fallow is

enriched with trees, shrubs or vines, the process of rehabilitation may be accelerated, thereby

shortening the length of their non-utilization or fallow periods. Normally, nitrogen-fixing plants

are used, because they are vigorous, deep-rooted, tolerant of drought, and have the ability to

accumulate atmospheric nitrogen. Some of these species include acacia, albizia, prosopis,

leucaena, inga, etc. During the fallow period, the plants accumulate nitrogen from the air and from

deep layers of the soil, and drop their leaf litter to enrich the soil and conserve moisture. When

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

the trees are removed at the end of the fallow period, their roots remain in the soil to decompose

gradually, releasing additional nutrients to the subsequent crops. The trees in the fallow also

impede the establishment of undesirable weeds, making the subsequent establishment of crops

easier than if the area had to be cleared of undesirable weeds. In this of this, the scheme has a

huge potential to contribute to sustainable agriculture.

Issues and Challenges

Some of the major issues and challenges in the Scheme are as follows:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  Prior to implementation, states need to prepare an action plan for development on cluster-  
    basis, indicating the year-wise activities and corresponding fund requirement spread  
    across four years. Since the project proposals of each year will have residual activities for  
    the remaining three years, the annual action plan for a specific year need to be planned in  
    such a manner that the year wise phased activities of the approved projects are properly  
    provisioned during assessment of fund requirement. It may be difficult to accurately assess  
    on two accounts: the costs of the materials may change immensely during these four years,  
    and the budget allocated to the scheme may not be in proportion to the requirement of the  
    targets to be achieved, leading to under-achievement of targets set. Continuous under-  
    achievement of targets may lead to further reduction in budget allocation, hence forming a  
    vicious cycle of insufficient budget and under-achievement of targets.
2.  Agroforestry growth and development is influenced by various policies of the economy like  
    credit, trade, taxation, power, transport, etc. These policies impact the sector either directly  
    or indirectly besides the core forest and agriculture policies which have a larger bearing on  
    the agroforestry policies in the Indian context. However, agriculture is a state subject,  
    whereas forestry is in the concurrent list. It lacked a supporting regulatory framework and  
    the farmers could not take out loans or insurance policies for agroforestry practices.  
    Additionally, extension services were not trained or equipped to support farmers who  
    practice agroforestry on their land. Agroforestry research is with the ICAR, but its  
    development and extension still lags behind due to inefficient Centre-State coordination on  
    agroforestry.
3.  Another major issue hampering the success of the mission is the strict regulation of felling  
    and transit prescriptions on wood and wood products coming from agroforestry, farm  
    forestry and tree cropping areas. While SMAF is applicable only in states where these  
    regulations have been eased, felling and transport of trees for selling (once harvested) can  
    be challenging in other states. KIIs revealed that this is one of the key reasons for limited  
    offtake in the mission.
4.  Presently, the SMAF does not offer any incentives to private sector for investing in the  
    sector. Limited participation from the private sector is another issue as private players can  
    aid in technology development and dissemination. It can also play a key role in providing  
    institutional credit and insurance cover for agroforestry, and commercialising traditional  
    agro forestry-related activities like weaving, basket making, etc.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  The utilization in the Mission has been poor as less than 15% of the funds released have  
    been utilized.

Figure 186 : Expenditure and utilization under SMAF

Source: Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare, MIS Report, retrieved from  
https://nmsa.dac.gov.in/RptAllocationReleaseProgress.aspx, accessed on 15 December 2019

Along with unutilized funds, there has been under-achievement of Mission targets. Barely one

percent of the annual target for planting of trees has been achieved in 201 8 - 19. Less than 25% of

the targeted nurseries have been set up. The number of trainings, seminars, campaigns, etc. have

been over-achieved by almost three times. However, given that the number of trees planted has

been low, the impact of these trainings seems insufficient.

1.  KIIs indicated that the scheme hasn’t taken off as farmers are unwilling to substitute crops

with agro forestry products as they take longer time to mature. Indian farmers, most of whom

have small landholdings and limited income, are not willing to wait long durations to monetize

their produce, and hence are unwilling to cultivate agro forestry products. For example, Teak

is one of the faster growing tropical hardwoods, yet, it takes 20 to 25 years to grow into a

mature tropical tree to final harvest.

C. Capacity building

1.  Capacity building and training is one of the important interventions of the Mission. States  
    can utilise up to 5% of the allocated funds for capacity building and training activities.  
    Activities like training of farmers/field workers, skill development, awareness campaign,  
    publications, documentation, exposure visits, seminars/workshops, conferences etc. are  
    undertaken in the Mission. While the target number of trainings, seminars, campaigns, etc.  
    have been over-achieved, there is significant gap in meeting targets for number of nurseries,  
    and generation of capacity for quality planting material. The impact of these trainings on  
    adoption thus seems limited.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  The guidelines stipulate that a mechanism for MIS and periodical assessment using GIS  
    technologies be adopted for ensuring effective implementation of the programme. The  
    digital location of the cluster with the attributes of interventions like plantation area,  
    number of plants, name of beneficiaries, details of nurseries, project cost etc. also needs to  
    be uploaded in the Bhuvan Platform. However, geo-tagging is not being implemented fully  
    and comprehensively. The data is also not being uploaded regularly in Bhuvan portal. The  
    data on the portal exists only for few plantations and available only for very few states.

E. Others

1.  Several studies have highlighted the shortage of superior planting material and improved

seed varieties. As per these studies, only about 10% of planting material is of high quality, the

rest is without any guarantee for quality standard^328. Quality assurance of genetically

improved planting stock, particularly for long-rotation timber species is crucial for

safeguarding the interest of farmers and industries.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the key recommendations for the scheme:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The action plans needs to be revised, cost norms for different types of agroforestry  
    systems needs to be developed, in addition costs for inputs, planting material, block

(^328) Journal of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, Prashant Sharma, MK Singh, Prabhat Tiwari and Kamlesh  
Verma, Agroforestry systems: Opportunities and challenges in India, 2017

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

plantation, boundary plantations etc. have to be worked out in-detail. For block plantation

at least five year estimates have to be prepared from advanced soil work to maintenance

till fifth year

1.  Many agricultural and even forestry institutes have technical experts on land  
    management and agroforestry systems, inputs of these experts can be taken up for  
    developing the scheme, training manuals and cost estimates, their services can also be  
    availed for training of trainer activities.
2.  It is important to note that many states across India have liberalized the transit rules,  
    every state has delisted a set of species from purview of transit and felling regulations.  
    The list of these species is available on public domain or can accessed through state forest  
    department, it is better to promote the delisted species for agroforestry then go for a  
    restrict species. The number of delisted species often exceed the restrict species in each  
    state.
3.  Provision can be introduced in scheme to facilitate and encourage participation of  
    entrepreneurs or private firms, Private sector can also play a key role in providing  
    institutional credit and insurance cover for agroforestry, and commercializing traditional  
    agro forestry-related activities like weaving, basket making, etc.

Private sector linkages may be facilitated through awareness building and incentivizing

the private players such as furniture and plywood industry, wood-based biomass power,

packaging industries etc. to establish linkages with growers under contract farming / buy-

back models.

1.  Tree species that are multipurpose, fast growing, economically in terms of input & labor  
    expenses and return should be promoted.
2.  There is a need to provide quality assurance of genetically improved planting stock,  
    particularly for long-rotation timber species for safeguarding the interest of farmers and  
    industries. To achieve the large-scale supply of genetically superior quality planting  
    material, there is a need to replicate the success achieved in case of eucalyptus, poplar,  
    casuarina and subabul through a larger role played by private sector companies. The  
    projected annual requirement of planting stock is 6,160 million seedlings of different tree  
    species and to fulfil this, research institutions, private organizations and forest  
    departments must come together to establish good linkages among farmers for the  
    production of planting material for identified species in the National Agroforestry Policy.  
    National and state-level research institutions, forest departments and universities should  
    enter into a convergence mode to cater to the needs of superior planting stock.

In this context, provision should be made under the scheme to facilitate technical

assistance to such beneficiaries on aspects of contemporary product design and

development, business plan formulation, branding, marketing etc. Provision should also

be made under the scheme or through conference for supply of special tools kits/ small

equipment sets that may be required by the beneficiaries for management of agro-forestry

resources and its primary processing.

1.  For effective and wider scale extension services on best practices for agro-forestry, NGOs  
    and private sector participation through partnership and CSR initiatives should be

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

encouraged. Appropriate budgetary provision should be made under the scheme to

incentivize/ compensate such agencies so as to encourage their involvement.

1.  Agroforestry adoption can result in increased self-employment opportunities through  
    interventions like nursery raising, mat weaving, basket making etc. Employment may also  
    be generated through plantation, processing, and utilization marketing. Studies reveal  
    that these agroforestry systems have the potential to generate employment opportunities  
    of 450 man-days per hectare per year. The scheme, however, does not currently track the  
    employment generated through scheme interventions. Additional income and rural  
    livelihood generation is one of the key objectives of the scheme. Targets must be set and  
    monitored in this respects, so that appropriate measures may be taken to achieve the  
    targeted results.
2.  The scheme also has significant potential for addressing the issues related to gender  
    mainstreaming and inclusiveness. Thus, special interventions / preference should be  
    accorded to interventions that encourage women participation such as facilitating  
    mobilization of women into SHGs/ groups and supporting them collective aggregation of  
    produce, primary processing, value addition & marketing etc.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  Concerted efforts and better planning is needed for encouraging agroforestry activities,  
    the guidelines and cost norms should be appropriately revised to consider different  
    agroforestry systems. Convergence with other schemes and programme such as those  
    implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer Welfare, Ministry of Food  
    Processing Industries, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, should be explored to facilitate  
    strengthening of infrastructure related to marketing of the agro-forestry produce, setting  
    up of common facilities for value addition, supply chain strengthening, developing agro-  
    forestry based industrial hubs, market and credit access etc.
2.  There are many successful interventions wherein farmers have been actively engaged in  
    agroforestry activities, lessons can be drawn from them. For example interventions like  
    Green India Mission, JICA supported forestry projects in Odisha, UP Tripura and World  
    bank supported forestry interventions, wherein farm-forestry has been successfully  
    implemented. Study of these interventions can help in can help in robust planning for  
    mission activities. Our experience suggest that the farmers can be easily encouraged to  
    adapt at least periphery or boundary plantations.

C. Capacity building

1.  For effective and wider scale extension services on best practices for agro-forestry, NGOs  
    and private sector participation through partnership and CSR initiatives should be  
    encouraged. Appropriate budgetary provision should be made under the scheme to  
    incentivize/ compensate such agencies so as to encourage their involvement.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  Geo-tagging can help in better tracking and monitoring of scheme progress with respect  
    to asset creation. It can also help in enabling traceability of produce and aid certification  
    of produce. Accessibility to updated information related to produce type & availability will  
    also encourage the private player to participate and invest along the value chain,  
    particularly, aid in aid in technology development and dissemination, providing

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

institutional credit and insurance cover for agroforestry, commercializing traditional agro

forestry-related activities like weaving, basket making, craft & furniture, medicinal

products, etc.

1.  Output indicators like saplings planted should be supplemented with indicators on their  
    survival at intervals of 2-3 years.
2.  Outcome indicators are output indicators have been found to be overlapping (or not fully  
    aligned) in many instances and there is need to redefine some of the outcome indicators.  
    For example, outcome indicator is no. of farmers trained in best practices of agro-forestry,  
    whereas the output indicator is no. of trainings held. In this case, the outcome indicator  
    should have been the no. of farmers adopting agroforestry practices after attending the  
    trainings. In addition, some more outcome indicators that may be tracked to assess the  
    scheme performance may include change in soil organic carbon content, effect on climate  
    change related measures such as rise in temperature level, reduction in soil erosion etc.
3.  Social audit should be conducted for assessment of effectiveness, efficiency and impact  
    being made by the scheme.

E. Others

1.  To achieve the large-scale supply of genetically superior quality planting material, there  
    is a need to replicate the success achieved in case of eucalyptus, poplar, casuarina and  
    subabul through a larger role played by private sector companies. The projected annual  
    requirement of planting stock is 6,160 million seedlings^329 of different tree species and to  
    fulfil this, research institutions, private organizations and forest departments must come  
    together to establish good linkages among farmers for the production of planting material  
    for identified species in the National Agroforestry Policy. National and state-level research  
    institutions, forest departments and universities should enter into a convergence mode to  
    cater to the needs of superior planting stock.

Policy in India: a low hanging fruit  
**Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:**  
This scheme can help in diversification of income by promoting agroforestry activities.  
These activities can help in improving tree cover and increasing carbon sequestration  
to mitigate climate change. It can also help in reducing pressure for fuel wood, timber  
and other resources from natural forests. Therefore, the scheme needs to be continued.  
However, the scheme has achieved little so far and needs major changes. Efforts to  
spruce up achieving targets are needed, there are different models (i.e. agro-horti-silvi,  
agro-silvi etc.) of agroforestry that can be promoted through the scheme instead of  
current block and peripheral plantation. The scheme also needs to promote only those  
species which are not under the state transit pass rules.

2.2.17 National Bamboo Mission

Background of the Scheme

The National Bamboo Mission (NBM) was launched as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme in 2006- 07

and was subsumed under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) during

2014 - 15 and continued till 2015-16. Funds were released thereafter only for maintenance of

bamboo plantations raised earlier under NBM. In 2018-19, the mission, in its restructured format

became a sub scheme of National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). The Mission

focusses on the development of complete value chain of bamboo sector and link growers with

markets. The emphasis of the new Mission is on propagation of quality plantations of bamboo of

the commercially required species, product development and value addition. The Mission

envisages promoting holistic growth of bamboo sector by adopting area-based, regionally

differentiated strategy and to increase the area under bamboo cultivation and marketing. The

Mission focusses on development of bamboo in limited States where it has social, commercial and

economical advantage, particularly in the **North Eastern region and States including Madhya**

**Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand,**

**Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Kerala**.

The Mission is expected to establish about 4000 treatment/ product development units and bring

more than 1,00,000 ha area under plantation during the period 2018-19 & 2019-20.

**Objectives of the Mission**

• To increase the area under bamboo plantation in non-forest Government and private

lands to supplement farm income and contribute towards resilience to climate change as

well as availability of quality raw material requirement of industries. The bamboo

plantations will be promoted predominantly in farmers’ fields, homesteads, community

lands, arable wastelands, and along irrigation canals, water bodies etc.

• To improve post-harvest management through establishment of innovative primary

processing units near the source of production, primary treatment and seasoning plants,

preservation technologies and market infrastructure.

• To promote product development keeping in view market demand, by assisting R&D,

entrepreneurship & business models at cooperative, micro, small and medium levels and

feed bigger industry.

• To rejuvenate the under developed bamboo industry in India.

• To promote skill development, capacity building, awareness generation for development

of bamboo sector from production to market demand.

• To realign efforts so as to reduce dependency on import of bamboo and bamboo products

by way of improved productivity and suitability of domestic raw material for industry, so

as to enhance income of the primary producers.

**Components**

• Propagation & cultivation

• Promotion of bamboo treatment and preservation

• Product development and processing

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Promotion and development of infrastructure for bamboo market

• Development of tools, equipment & machinery

• Skill development and awareness campaign

• Research & development

• Project management

Budget Estimate for the year 2019-20 is Rs. 150 crores**.** The activities under NBM are approved

as per the Annual Action Plans received from the State Governments. The operational guidelines

of NBM provide inter alia assistance for treatment, establishment of markets, incubation centres,

value added product development and processing, development of tools & equipment, research

& development, both in the Government and Private Sector which would include start-ups also.

**Implementation structure and stakeholders**

National level

At the national level, NBM is overseen by an Executive Committee (EC). The EC is also responsible

for approving the action plan of the states/UTs. It will be led by Secretary (AC&FW) as

Chairperson. There are two sub committees under the EC. Sub Committee 1 deliberates on issues

related to propagation and cultivation (identification of appropriate species, planting techniques,

tissue culture, development of new varieties, improving the productivity) of bamboo plantations

in the country. The Sub Committee 2 advises on ways and means to rejuvenate the bamboo

industry, both small enterprises and cottage industry, as well as the larger commercial units to

enable a definite role in both domestic markets and for exports. Innovations in product

development and processes, including indigenous tools and equipment are the main mandates of

this sub committee. A National Bamboo Mission Cell (NBMC) headed by the Mission Director, NBM

is established at the DAC&FW. The NBMC the repository of information on various aspects of the

bamboo value chain, with adequate support from various other Ministries and Departments of

GoI. Experts on the Cell guide and advice for effective implementation of the Mission. A Bamboo

Technical Support Group (BTSG) is set up to provide necessary technical support to the Mission.

State level

At the state level, a State Level Executive Committee (SLEC), headed by Chief Secretary of the

State is set up for anchoring the State Bamboo Mission (SBM). The SLEC is responsible for

approving the annual action plans of the States before communicating to the Executive Council of

the NBM at the National level for approvals and release of funds and ensuring effective

implementation & monitoring the scheme. The SBM focusses on primary processing units

specializing in specific steps of pre-product processing to be established near areas of bamboo

production. Further, a Bamboo Development Agency (BDA) is involved in the implementation of

NBM activities.

States shall prepare a comprehensive Action Plan envisaging all interventions under NBM for a 5-

year period, outlining specific short, medium as well as long term plans for a structured reform of

the sector keeping in view the potential areas for cluster formation, cultivation and establishment

of industries so that supply-demand can be addressed. The Annual Action Plan (AAP) shall be

prepared on the basis of this document.

District level

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The Bamboo Development Agency of every State constitutes a District Level Agency. The Agency

comprises of officials from Industries, Agriculture/ Horticulture, Forest, Rural Development and

other line departments, SHGs, NGOs etc. All proposals received by the Agency are compiled and

sent to the BDA for appraisal and scrutiny. This Agency also oversees, coordinates and controls

all activities at the district level for non-forest areas. The District Industries Centre (DIC) Planning

Committee and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) will be integrated/ involved in implementing the

programme depending on their expertise and available infrastructure. The District level officer of

the nodal department is the Member Secretary. To avoid duplication, coordination is ensured by

the Committees at different levels while approving the district plans.

Dedicated Project Management Teams at District, State and National Level are set up to address

effective coordination and synergy of different segments of the value chain.

For Monitoring & Evaluation, a two-tiered system will be adopted i.e. Executive Committee (EC)

at National Level and State Level Executive Committee (SLEC) at State level. NBM guidelines also

stipulate third party independent evaluation study as approved by EC. Such an evaluation must

ensure participation & feedback from the farmers, farmers groups, artisans, women, etc.

**Intended contribution to sectoral performance**

India has the highest area (13.96 million ha) under bamboo and is second only to China in terms

of bamboo diversity, with 136 species. Despite this, India is a net importer of bamboo, indicating

greater opportunities to harness the market potential by increasing its production and ensuring

establishment of a proper value chain ecosystem. Though Madhya Pradesh has the largest area

under bamboo forests, bamboo culture thrives in the North Eastern region. Bamboo plantations

start yielding after only 4-7 years (compared to other agro forestry products) and may become

part of agro forestry practice in small land holdings. It can also be planted to reclaim severely

degraded sites and wastelands. It is good soil binder owing to its peculiar clump formation and

fibrous root system and hence also plays an important role in soil and water conservation.

While National Bamboo Mission was launched in 2007, it did not meet expectations as it lacked

linkages between producers and industry, and did not focus on value addition. The re-structured

National Bamboo Mission was thus launched in 2018-19 with an aim to support the development

of the entire value chain of the bamboo sector starting from planting material, plantation, creation

of facilities for collection, aggregation, processing marketing, micro, small & medium enterprises,

skill development and brand building initiative in a cluster approach mode.

**Intended contribution to national and international goals**

The Mission has high relevance in meeting National Development Agenda as it focusses on making

agriculture more remunerative for farmers as bamboo products have a higher market value due

to their commercial nature. The re-structured NBM specifically also focusses on value addition

through propagation of bamboo plantations of commercially required species, and formation of

linkages between producers and industry. Moreover, bamboo products can sustain extreme

temperature changes compared to crops, making them more disaster resilient (for e.g., in case of

inadequate or excessive rainfall).

It has relevance to UN SDG of No Poverty and Zero Hunger as well. Making agriculture more

remunerative through sowing of bamboo products can complement the incomes of farmers. The

additional income is especially important in case of low income from agricultural produce. Given

their higher resistance to extreme temperatures, NBM can contribute to Goal 2.4 of UN SDG, viz.,

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

“By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural

practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that

strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and

other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality.” This also similarly

contributes to SDG 13 of Climate Action. The Mission thus contributes to following SDGs:

Goal 1- No Poverty - Making agriculture more remunerative

Goal 2- Zero Hunger – Promoting sustainable food production systems

Goal 13 – Climate Action – Enriching soil nutrients, serving as wood substitute

In a nutshell, NBM contributes to following national and international goals:

(^330) NRM Division, National Bamboo Mission, Minutes of Third meeting of Executive Committee under National  
Bamboo Mission, 29 May 2019

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Observations:**

• Targets set under the Mission are significantly under-achieved. This is expected as the

Mission is yet to take off.

• Private sector is yet to undertake any activities under the Mission.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• While National Bamboo Mission was launched in 2007, it did not meet expectations as it

lacked linkages between producers and industry, and did not focus on value addition. The

re-structured National Bamboo Mission was thus launched in 2018-19 with an aim to

support the development of the entire value chain of the bamboo sector starting from

planting material, plantation, creation of facilities for collection, aggregation, processing

marketing, micro, small & medium enterprises, skill development and brand building

initiative in a cluster approach mode.

• Mission has high relevance in meeting National Development Agenda as it focusses on

making agriculture more remunerative for farmers as bamboo products have a higher

market value due to their commercial nature.

• The Scheme through the area expansion component directly contributes to enhancing

additional income and livelihood of growers. Promoting such plantation activities and

primary processing of produce under community-linked/ collective models can help

achieve the required economies of scale and thus facilitate stronger forward linkages with

private players /bulk buyers.

• While the scheme objective focus on product and skill development to suit the market

need, it lacks emphasis on creation of effective backward and forward linkages of the

farmers/ producer groups with the markets/ processors.

**Effectiveness**

• Targets set under the Mission are significantly under-achieved. This is expected as the

Mission is yet to take off.

• For 2018-19, the targets linked to scheme output and outcome indicators are not

available. Therefore, it is suggested that the annual targets may be set and updated

accordingly to help monitor the scheme performance on periodic basis.

**Efficiency**

• Expenditure, allocation and release data indicates low financial utilization.

• It may be noted that the scheme is very recently launched. However, periodic reporting

on progress of mission implementation and tracking of fund utilization should be

maintained so that appropriate actions may be taken in timely manner.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Sustainability**

• Representative members from Industry may also include as invited members in the

Bamboo Technical Support Group for seeking feedback on changing consumer trends and

catering to the market requirement.

• Strengthening farmer groups, SHG federations, FPO/ FPC should be focused upon for

ensuring sustainability.

**Impact**

• Bamboo propagation can play a significant role in landscape restoration and carbon

forestry. Thus, synergies with other central/ state program and initiatives related to land

use management and conservation should be explored and leveraged for additional

income generation for the beneficiaries.

**Equity**

• There are no specific provisions for women in the Mission. It also does not have any

targets regarding employment of women even though bamboo handicrafts have the

potential to provide employment and entrepreneurial opportunities to women in rural

India.

• The scheme allocates funds to SC/STs to ensure participation of these marginalized

groups in the sector. However, specific measures and awareness campaigns have not been

undertaken to encourage these groups to enter this sector.

Discussion on Cross-Sectional Thematic Areas

i. Accountability and transparency

The implementation mechanism under NBM is quite robust, with an Executive Committee at the

National level, which oversees two Sub-Committees. A National Bamboo Mission Cell and a

Bamboo Technical Support Group has also been established at the national level. A State Level

Executive Committee (SLEC), which reports to the EC at National level, is responsible for

anchoring the State Bamboo Mission (SBM). At the district level, District Industries Centre (DIC)

Planning Committee and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) will be integrated/ involved in

implementing the programme depending on their expertise and available infrastructure.

Dedicated Project Management Teams at District, State and National Level are set up to address

effective coordination and synergy of different segments of the value chain. Given this nodal

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

structure, accountability at each level is high. In terms of transparency, data on allocation, release

and expenditure, and financial and physical achievement is available, along with scheme

guidelines.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The data availability for the scheme was decent. The information available on public

domain included scheme guidelines, year-wise allocation, release and expenditure of

funds, year-wise physical and financial achievement, and release of funds for General, and

SC/ST beneficiaries. The said data was available state-wise as well.

• Beneficiary-level data, however, is not available.

• Scheme guidelines stipulate mid-term and end-term evaluation of the scheme. However,

given that the scheme is new, there have been no evaluation as of date.

• No social audit has been undertaken for the scheme.

• For monitoring, a two-tiered structure has been put in place – EC at National level, and

SLEC at State level.

• For monitoring, MIS and periodic assessment using GIS is adopted.

• Guidelines stipulate that geo-tagging of all infrastructure be uploaded in the Bhuvan

Platform. However, data is not updated on the portal.

• Grievances are handled on regular basis through Centralized Public Grievance Redress

and Monitoring System (CPGRAM) and RTIs.

ii. Direct/Indirect employment generation

One of the objectives of the Mission is to expand employment opportunities. Studies reveal that

these agroforestry systems have the potential to generate employment opportunities of 516.33

million man days hectare per year^331. The scheme, however, does not currently track the

employment generated.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• The Mission does not monitor the level of employment generated even though

employment generation is one of its objectives.

• Several studies have indicate the huge potential of generating employment through agro

forestry systems. For instance, Dalwai Committee Report on Doubling Farmers; Income

estimated that bamboo has the potential to generate employment opportunities of 516.33

million man-days per year.

• There is substantial potential for employment generation through the Mission.

− Bamboo cultivation can result in increased self-employment opportunities through

interventions such as bamboo flooring, laminated furniture, mat boards, strand lumber,

mat weaving, incense sticks, handicrafts, etc.

− Employment may also be generated through plantation, processing, and marketing.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

iii. Gender Mainstreaming

There are no specific provisions for women in the Mission. It also does not have any targets

regarding employment of women even though bamboo handicrafts have the potential to provide

employment and entrepreneurial opportunities to women in rural India.

As per data on the NMSA website, below is the count of beneficiaries (2018-19), however, the data

does not capture all implementing states.

iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient

practices & diversifications

Bamboo is known to have the potential to mitigate the climate change effects through carbon

sequestration, restoring soil fertility at degraded lands, and its ability to grow without any

fertilisers. However, the do not specifically mandate any climate-resilient activities towards

capacity building of farmers for sustainable farming or employing climate-friendly practices for

processing.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the scheme

in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

There are no specific provisions for SC/ST beneficiaries in the Mission. However, the MIS does

track the number of SC/ST beneficiaries, and the fund allocated to them. As per NMSA website,

funds released to in 2018-19 as well as 2019-20 was over 40%.

vi. Use of IT/Technology in driving efficiency

The Mission plans to use ICT, Remote sensing, and Geographic Information System (GIS) for

planning and monitoring. The Mission also seeks to establish hi-tech nurseries and tissue culture

labs. R&D programmes shall also concentrate on technology generation. It also seeks to improve

processing technology. Transfer of technology through training, frontline demonstration,

publicity and training of the trainers are an integral part of the NBM.

vii. Development, dissemination & adoption of innovative practices, technology & know-

how

With an aim to encourage innovation in product development and processes, including

indigenous tools and equipment, a sub-committee has been set up under NBM. The sub-

committee’s responsibility is to advise on ways and means to rejuvenate the bamboo industry,

both small enterprises and cottage industry, as well as the larger commercial units to enable a

definite role in both domestic markets and for exports. Additionally, the Bamboo Technical

Support Group has also been entrusted to synergise inter-sectoral interaction for innovations.

The focus of innovations under NBM will be on product development, value addition, preservation

& storage, primary processing, market linkage, skill development, etc.

**_viii. Research & Development_**

Research & Development is an important component under NBM. The focus of R&D activities is

to increase the production and productivity of bamboo by identifying its superior clones,

improvement of processing technology, development of new products and improvement of tools

& machinery, etc. With an aim to promote R&D activities, a sub-committee has been established.

This sub-committee has been entrusted with the responsibility of deliberating on issues related

to propagation and cultivation (identification of appropriate species, planting techniques, tissue

culture, development of new varieties, improving the productivity of bamboo plantations in the

country. The Deputy Director General (Research), ICFRE is the Convener of this sub-committee

and members are drawn from inter alia ICAR, CAFRI, DST, State Agriculture Universities, Central

Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), etc. Collaboration with international

organizations like International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR), World Agroforestry

Center (ICRAF) and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) will be strengthened for the

bamboo sector under the Mission.

ix. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives and civil

society in the scheme

The private sector is poised to play a significant role in the Mission. One of the core objectives of

NBM is to increase the area under bamboo plantation in non-forest Government and private lands.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The Mission encourages commercial production in private sector and cooperatives for regular

and sustained supply of planting material. It also encourages private sector involvement in R&D

initiatives.

The following was observed from primary and secondary analysis with respect to this scheme:

• NBM guidelines stipulate 50% assistance to private sector for setting up nurseries, in the

form of credit-linked back ended subsidy.

• Further, it offers assistance for high density bamboo plantations for private sector: 50%

of the cost upto 2 ha (~ <3000 plants), 20% of the cost for 2 - 4 ha (up to 10,000 plants)

over 3 years (50:30:20). Additional 10% assistance is provided for NE States. No subsidy

is provided for plantation over 4 ha.

• 50% of the cost of block plantations/boundary plantations on farmer field is provided to

private players over 3 years (50:30:20). Additional 10% assistance is provided for NE

States.

• Private players are also accorded subsidy on establishment of bamboo treatment and

seasoning plants, establishment of carbonisation plants, establishment of livelihood

business incubators, establishment of processing units for value addition of Bamboo,

establishment of bamboo depots and godowns, undertaking promotion of bamboo mandi

and e-trading, and undertaking R&D activities.

• Private and cooperative organisations are encouraged to set up tissue culture units for

supply of quality planting material in large quantities, which is free from diseases and

viruses.

• Contract farming, buy back agreement with industry, leasing of land may be promoted for

planting of bamboo on private, community, cooperative, wastelands, etc with an

appropriate network of nurseries.

• For achieving economies of scale, the Mission accords preference to Farmer Producer

Organisations (FPOs), Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs), Cooperatives, Village

Producers' Organizations (VPOs), Self Help Groups (SHGs), Cooperatives, etc.

• It also promotes extension activities, and education and skill development to be carried

out by private sector and NGOs.

Issues and Challenges

Some of the major issues and challenges in the scheme are as follows:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The implementation mechanism under NBM is quite robust, with an Executive Committee  
    at the National level, which oversees two Sub-Committees (Sub-Committee 1 and Sub-  
    Committee 2). A National Bamboo Mission Cell and a Bamboo Technical Support Group  
    have also been established at the national level. A State Level Executive Committee (SLEC),  
    which reports to the EC at National level, is responsible for anchoring the State Bamboo  
    Mission (SBM). At the district level, District Industries Centre (DIC) Planning Committee  
    and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) will be integrated/ involved in implementing the  
    programme depending on their expertise and available infrastructure. Dedicated Project  
    Management Teams at District, State and National Level are set up to address effective  
    coordination and synergy of different segments of the value chain. Given this nodal  
    structure, accountability at each level is high. In terms of transparency, data on allocation,  
    release and expenditure, and financial and physical achievement is available, along with  
    scheme guidelines. While this ensures a robust implementation structure, the existence of  
    multiple agencies slows down decision-making and hinders fast-tracking of critical  
    projects. Typically, such a scenario would lead to delay in starting of projects and  
    consequent delay in disbursement of funds. By the time the funds are released, there may  
    also be a rise in raw material and project cost, rendering the whole mechanism less  
    fruitful. This also adds to the administrative work as reporting is to be done at all these  
    levels.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  The utilization in the Mission has been poor, as only 1% of the funds released have been  
    utilized.

While the EC has accorded ex-post approval for a sum of Rs. 1,386.27 lakh in eight states

(as on 29 May 2019), it is yet to be executed. Even though bamboo cultivation is a

traditional practice in India (India is the second largest producer of bamboo in the world),

the Mission is yet to take off despite restructuring it in favour of value addition, and

creation of linkages between farmers and industry. There has been significant under-

achievement of targets as well. Given that the restructured mission is fairly new, this is to

be expected.

C. Capacity building

1.  There is immense potential for capacity building under NBM as bamboo handicrafts  
    (basket making, mat weaving, incense sticks) are a traditional industry in India and  
    provides employment to many in rural India. Advanced training programmes provide  
    artisans with skills in semi-mechanized production of quality furniture and building  
    interior products as well as construction of cottages, gazebos and structures for eco-  
    tourist villages. The industry also provides self-employment opportunities to small and  
    marginal groups. The Mission also seeks to promote skill development, capacity building,  
    and awareness generation for development of bamboo sector. Capacity building of the  
    officials, field functionaries, entrepreneurs and farmers through skill development and  
    trainings is also emphasised under NBM.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

However, there are only few specialised institutions imparting education and vocational

training in bamboo handicrafts and furniture making. Some self-help groups exist in the

sector, but the Mission lacks any concrete steps towards strengthening these groups. KVKs

are also responsible for training and capacity building but KII discussions indicated that

they are already overburdened and hence have limited capacity to undertake this.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  A two tier M&E system exists under NBM- an Executive Committee (EC) at National Level  
    and State Level Executive Committee (SLEC) at State level. Regular third party evaluations  
    also need to be undertaken in the Mission. The guidelines stipulate that all states geo-tag  
    infrastructure for ensuring effective implementation of the programme and uploads on  
    Bhuvan portal. Currently, the data is not being uploaded on the portal.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the key recommendations for the scheme.

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The implementation mechanism of the scheme may be reviewed and revised  
    appropriately to increase efficiency and avoid delays. The scheme through the area  
    expansion component directly contributes to enhancing additional income and livelihood  
    of growers. Promoting such plantation activities and primary processing of produce under  
    community-linked/ collective models can help achieve the required economies of scale  
    and thus facilitate stronger forward linkages with private players/ bulk buyers.
2.  Involvement and participation of private sector need to be encouraged. Representative  
    members from industry may also include as invited members in the Bamboo Technical  
    Support Group for seeking feedback on changing consumer trends and catering to the  
    market requirement.
3.  Bamboo propagation can play a significant role in landscape restoration and carbon  
    forestry. Thus, synergies with other central/ state program and initiatives related to land  
    use management and conservation should be explored and leveraged for additional  
    income generation for the beneficiaries.
4.  Specific provisions for involvement of women need to be included. It also does not have  
    any targets regarding employment of women even though bamboo handicrafts have the

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

potential to provide employment and entrepreneurial opportunities to women in rural

India.

1.  The scheme allocates funds to SC/STs to ensure participation of these marginalized  
    groups in the sector. However, specific measures and awareness campaigns need to be  
    undertaken to encourage these groups to enter this sector.

B. Fund flow efficiency and utilisation

1.  The scheme is very recently launched hence it’s too early to comment on the efficiency.  
    However, periodic reporting on progress of mission implementation and tracking of fund  
    utilization should be maintained so that appropriate actions may be taken in timely  
    manner. Also, measures should be taken to ensure timely contribution of state’s share of  
    fund, to avoid delays in expending funds.

C. Capacity building

1.  Private institutions or NGOs who have already worked in similar projects can be engaged  
    for capacity building, moreover state forest research institutes, IIFM, INBAR etc. can also  
    be contacted for facilitating training and capacity building activities
2.  Scheme objectives/ component should be expanded to support aggregation of farmers  
    into farmer groups/ FPOs/ FPCs/ SHGs & also facilitating their tie-ups with market  
    aggregators and financial institution.
3.  The scheme does not specifically mandate any climate-resilient activities. There is need  
    for specific training/ awareness campaigns to sensitize beneficiaries about climate  
    change, its impact and risk mitigation mechanisms including climate resilient practices.
4.  Focus on rigorous extension services is also critical for dissemination of appropriate  
    practices/ technologies to farmers for commercialized cultivation.
5.  For improvement of the knowledge of the field staff, periodical refresher training courses  
    should be organized.

D. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  The data of activity progress needs to be tracked and monitored as envisaged in guidelines
2.  For 2018-19, the targets linked to scheme output and outcome indicators are not  
    available. Therefore, it is suggested that the annual targets may be set and updated  
    accordingly to help monitor the scheme performance on periodic basis.

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

This is a relatively new scheme. The scheme does have a potential to play important

role in sectoral growth as Bamboo is a fast growing multi-purpose specie with variety

of uses. The scheme therefore is relevant and may be continued.

2.2.18 Integrated Scheme on Agricultural Cooperation

Background of the Scheme

The Integrated Scheme on Agricultural Cooperation (ISAC) came into existence through the

merger of two other pre-existing schemes. ISAC is the product of two erstwhile schemes belonging

to the 11th Plan namely,

i. The restructured central sector scheme for assistance to National Cooperation

Development Corporation (NCDC) – Programmes for Development of Cooperatives

ii. The central sector scheme for Cooperative Education and Training.

The primary aim of the scheme is to address the issues of improving the status of the cooperatives,

eradicate the imbalances at the regional level. Another agenda is to accelerate the holistic

development of the cooperatives in areas of agricultural marketing, processing, storage,

computerization and weaker section programmes. ISAC also emphasises on generating

remunerative prices for the produce of the cotton farmers with significant value addition. Supply

of quality yarn at reasonable rates to the fragmented and decentralized weavers are also taken

care.

Objectives of the programme

The primary objectives of the scheme are as follows^332 :

• Streamlining the cooperative marketing structure

• Diversification of activities

• Capacity building of cooperatives to undertake value addition

• Enabling cooperatives to have storage/cold storage facilities

• Undertake business operations

• Improving activities in allies areas such as dairy, poultry, coir, handloom and sericulture

• Involving grassroots level cooperatives in integrated area development

• Helping cooperatives in the least/under developed states and those of weaker sections

through special programmes and schemes.

• Providing appropriate managerial and technical inputs besides manpower development

and training.

Major Components of ISAC

The Central sector Integrated Scheme on Agricultural Cooperation (ISAC) has got two major

components:

• Assistance to National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) Programmes for

Development of Cooperatives

• Assistance to Cooperative Education and Training

(^332) Source: https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=101603

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The below illustration gives a further insight to the components:

Figure 189 : Components of ISAC

Institutional Framework

The institutional framework for the implementation of ISAC activities, can be primarily bifurcated

into two separate parts depending on the two components which ISAC covers.

The first component of ISAC i.e. Assistance to National Cooperative Development Corporation

(NCDC) programmes for development of cooperatives is implemented by NCDC. It was

established in the year 1963 by an Act of Parliament as a statutory Corporation under the Ministry

of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. It operates as an apex institution which covers both the

financial as well as developmental aspects and is targeted solely towards the cooperative sector

of the country.

NCDC funds the states for the various schemes which are conducted under ISAC. For this purpose,

NCDC has evolved a framework of dividing the states of India in the following categories^333 :

i. Cooperatively least Developed States – Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand,

Jammu & Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura.

ii. Cooperatively Under Developed States/ Union Territories(UT) – Andhra Pradesh,

Chhattisgarh, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana,

Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Andaman& Nicobar Islands(UT) and

Lakshadweep(UT).

iii. Cooperatively Developed States/Union Territories(UT) – Gujarat, Haryana,

Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Chandigarh(UT), Dadra & Nagar

Haveli(UT), Daman & Diu(UT), Puducherry(UT) and Delhi.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Figure 190 : Organizational Chart of NCDC

NCDC is guided by a General Council (GC) which has the responsibility of giving the overall policy

level support and framework for implementation of the programme activities. In addition to the

GC, NCDC also has a Board of Management chaired by the Secretary of the DAC&FW. The board

also has a Vice Chairman and 12 member committee^334. The twelve member team is responsible

for the daily operational activities along with the other functional divisions which ensure the

proper monitoring and close supervision of their respective activities. At the last mile of service

delivery, there are a network of field offices on which lies the most important role of project

identification/formulation and ensure the time bound implementation of the projects.

The second component of ISAC i.e. Assistance to Cooperative Education and Training, is catered

by a number of institutions present across the national level. The two major players involved in

imparting the education and trainings under this component of ISAC are National Council for

Cooperative Training (NCCT) and the National Cooperative Union of India (NCUI). NCCT

organizes its education and training programmes through Vaikunth Mehta Institute of

Cooperative Management (VAMNICOM) and the five Regional Institute of Cooperative

Management (RICM) and fourteen Institute of Cooperative Management^335. The Junior

Cooperative Training Centres (JCTC) is supported by NCCT to address the training needs of the

junior functionaries in the cooperative institutions across a variety of areas like libraries,

classroom facilities, course design etc.

Key Activities

The key activities undertaken through ISAC can be summarized as follows:

• Marketing, Processing, Storage, Consumer, Weaker Section Programmes of Cooperatives,

Computerization of PACS, DCBs and SCBs and T&P Cell Scheme for strengthening

• Integrated Cooperative Development Projects in selected districts (ICDP)

• Imparting Cooperative Education through National Cooperative Union of India (NCUI).

• Cooperative Training by National Council for Cooperative Training (NCCT) and Vaikunth

Mehta National Institute of Cooperative Management (VAMNICOM)

• Assistance to Junior Cooperative Training Centres (JCTCs)

• Assistance to Centre for International Cooperation and Training in Agriculture Banking

(CICTAB)

Intended contribution to the sectoral performance

The cooperatives (cooperative sector) have always played a pivotal role in providing and

facilitating an array of services to the agriculture sector. The services includes marketing support,

disbursal of agricultural credit, distribution of agricultural inputs and imparting of various

trainings pertaining to the cooperatives^336. In order to bring down the gap of excessive

polarization of economic status between the rich and the poor segments of the population present

in the rural setup and also the imbalances present among the urban and the rural, there is a strong

need for cooperation to be established and long term strategies to be developed by the

Cooperation Division (Annual Report 2018-19, DAC&FW).

ISAC has been instrumental in building a strong network of cooperatives at grassroots level,

helping in the economic development of agriculture and the allied sectors. ISAC getting

implemented through the NCDC, has seen progress through the Integrated Cooperative

Development Project (ICDP). ICDP played a pivotal role in development of Primary Agriculture

Credit Societies, allied sector cooperatives and also established viable functional linkages

between the cooperatives.

The national level cooperative federations playing a leadership role in cooperative development

activities, has received support from the scheme in terms of benefitting themselves from

assistance received in undertaking promotional and research activities, improvement in

infrastructural facilities and also building up their equity base.

The cooperatives belonging to the less developed and under developed regions have also

benefitted from the programme through the training, handholding and financial support provided

by NCDC. This has resulted in decrease in the regional imbalances, accelerating the development

of the cooperatives in the areas of processing and storage, agricultural marketing

computerization of Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACS) and also addressed

the modernization/rehabilitation of existing spinning mills, ginning and pressing units.

Performance of the Scheme

Financial Performance

The financial performance of the scheme (ISAC) has been quite well over the years as is evident

from the table below. Every year nearly 100% of the allocated funds have been utilized. FY 2017-

18 witnessed the highest funds allocation under ISAC and also the highest utilization. But after FY

2017 - 18, there has been nearly a 50% drop in the funds allocated for the scheme in 2018 - 19,

which consequently resulted in lower actual expenses done for the year. Across the years, the

budgeted amount has been constant at about INR 130 crore.

thousand participants are trained under RICMs/ICMS and nearly 3000 cooperatives in selected

backward districts are being supported every year since 2012-13 under ICDP. The financial

support to cooperatives has been extended through NCDC and trainings have been provided

through VAMNICOM, RICMs and CICATB. In addition, this scheme has been extending support to

spinning mills.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• The cooperatives (cooperative sector) have always played a pivotal role in providing and

facilitating an array of services to the agriculture sector. ISAC has been instrumental in

building a strong network of cooperatives at grassroots level, helping in the economic

development of agriculture and the allied sectors.

• The scheme has specific components which include Assistance to National Cooperative

Development Corporation (NCDC) Programmes for Development of Cooperatives and

Assistance to Cooperative Education and Training.

**Effectiveness**

• On an average more than 17,000 cooperatives are being supported through the scheme

for marketing storage and processing activities, more than 60 thousand participants are

trained under RICMs/ICMS and nearly 3000 cooperatives in selected backward districts

are being supported every year since 2012-13 under ICDP.

• The information on output and outcome indicator is very limited.

**Efficiency**

• The financial performance of the scheme (ISAC) has been quite well over the years.

• Every year nearly 100% of the allocated funds have been utilized. FY 2017-18 witnessed

the highest funds allocation under ISAC and also the highest utilization. But after FY 2017-

18, there has been nearly a 50% drop in the funds allocated for the scheme in 2018-19,

which consequently resulted in lower actual expenses done for the year.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Sustainability**

• While the components are relevant to the scheme’s objectives, it is important to assess

the impact of the scheme for long-term development and sustainability of the

cooperatives.

• Linkages for selling of produce has been highlighted as a major concern across all the

discussions and is an important aspect for sustainability.

• The board of directors mostly lack the skills to plan for growth of the company.

**Impact**

• The requirements of buyers needs to be matched with the variety of produce by farmers.

• The cooperatives belonging to the less developed and under developed regions have also

benefitted from the programme through the training, handholding and financial support

provided by NCDC. This has resulted in decrease in the regional imbalances, accelerating

the development of the cooperatives in the areas of processing and storage, agricultural

marketing computerization of Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACS)

and also addressed the modernization/rehabilitation of existing spinning mills, ginning

and pressing units.

• The scheme primarily supports PACS and FPOs are not being supported.

**Equity**

• ISAC acknowledges the role of women in formation of agricultural cooperatives. Through

NCDC, the women are encouraged to avail different services which are available in the

scheme.

• The scheme through its implementing agency promotes and finance projects targeted

towards the weaker sections of the society, which include SCs and STs.

**Discussion on cross-sectional thematic areas**

i. Accountability and Transparency

ISAC takes into consideration accountability and transparency during implementation of the

activities through NCDC. Evident from the organization structure of NCDC there is a dedicated

position of Appellate Authority & Transparency Officer reporting directly to the Deputy Managing

Director of NCDC. Thus the aspect of maintaining transparency and proper implementation of all

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

the activities have been institutionalized within the organizational framework. Any form of

grievances or queries related to Right to Information is routed to the Appellate Authority who in

turn investigates the cases and prepares the final report on the same.

NCDC is also involved in continuous monitoring of the project activities which are being

conducted and have dedicated teams to carry out the same. However, as highlighted above, there

are no evaluation reports available for the scheme in public domain.

ii. Direct / indirect employment generation

ISAC has strived continuously towards creating employment opportunities for the farmers

through formation of cooperatives. The activities taken up by NCDC, have been targeted towards

the national agenda of Doubling the Farmers’ Income. The activities conducted in various projects

sanctioned and funded by NCDC are designed to improve and increase the income and create a

stable income generating stream of livelihoods for the farmers, especially the deprived weaker

sections of the farming community. ICDP initiatives are carried out keeping in mind a much more

targeted approach towards the economic upliftment of a particular region. Specific activities are

also taken up by NCDC specifically for women and customized for enhancing the opportunities of

increasing the alternative livelihood options for them.

iii. Gender Mainstreaming

_Rural cooperatives and farmers’ organizations play a crucial role in the eradication of hunger and_

_poverty. One of the ways they achieve this is through their vocation to empower small agricultural_

_producers, and in particular women farmers_^340**. – FAO**

FAO’s report has clearly suggested that keeping away the gender discrimination in the

agricultural sector can lead to considerable growth in the total production of the developing

nations to an extent of 2.5 to 4 per cent, thus directly having a remarkable effect of bringing down

the hunger. Hence, it is imperative that women be included and collectivised to form agricultural

cooperatives which will help them in the pursuit of economic independence. Utilization of women

labour for productive purposes under Cooperative Movement can increase the gross national

income and this can help to achieve our objective of socio-economic development.

ISAC also acknowledges the role of women in formation of agricultural cooperatives. Through

NCDC, the women are encouraged to avail different services which are available in the scheme. A

large number of women members are engaged / involved in cooperatives dealing with fruits &

vegetables, ICDP, sugarcane processing, consumer stores, handloom, power loom, spinning and

services etc. activities. During FY 2017-18, NCDC has sanctioned a cumulative amount of INR

786.72 crore to fourteen cooperative societies promoted and managed solely by women^341.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

NCUI also conducts several cooperative eduction programmes with the sole focus of empowering

the women.

iv. Climate Change and Sustainability including Climate Change Resilient practices

and diversifications

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), through its climate change model, has

predicted a rise of India’s temperature by 3- 4

degrees by the end of the 21st Century.

Agriculture is a sector which is largely going

to get affected as a result of the ongoing

Climate Change phenomenon.

In order to manage efficiently and effectively

the risks arising out of such global events of

rising temperature, depleting natural

resources and deteriorating agricultural

productivity; farmers’ organizations and

agricultural cooperatives can act as pivotal

agents who can curb down the negative

impacts arising from such extreme weather

conditions and natural hazards^342. The large

size of their membership places cooperatives

in a unique position to raise member

awareness about the importance of reducing

their carbon footprints and to lobby

Governments to significantly reduce their

greenhouse gas emissions.

Under ISAC, though there is no documentary

evidence of addressing the climate change

impacts, but some of the funding activities

undertaken by the NCDC, are listed below, to address the adverse effects of climate change:

• Water conservation works/services

• Generation and distribution of power by new, non-conventional and renewable sources

of energy

• Creation of water harvesting/irrigation infrastructural facilities

• Trainings conducted by NCUI targeted on climate change and environment protection.

v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the

scheme in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population

ISAC has taken into consideration the national agenda of rapid socio-economic development of

the tribal population as strategized in the Tribal Sub Plan. ISAC through its implementing agency

i.e. NCDC promote and finance projects targeted towards the weaker sections of the society, which

include Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (ST). Few of the key focus areas are mentioned

below.

• Scheduled Caste Cooperatives – cooperatives having more than 40% scheduled caste

members are categorized as Scheduled Caste cooperatives. By the end of FY 17-18, more

than INR 300 crore had been sanctioned for the units categorized as SC Cooperatives.

Chapter 3: Conclusion and Recommendations Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Scheduled Tribe Cooperatives – specific schemes have been formulated by NCDC towards

the strengthening of Large Sized Agriculture Multi-Purpose Cooperative Societies

(LAMPS) and Tribal Development Cooperative Corporation/Federations (TDCCF).

vi. Development, dissemination and adoption of innovative practices technology and

know-how through Technology / Adoption of ICT

Modernization of the cooperatives has been one of the primary activities taken up by NCDC with

the funds received through ISAC. In this regard, an important checklist that has been addressed is

computerization of the cooperatives. By the end of FY 2017-18, a total contribution of INR 310.15

crores had been made towards the computerization project. For transfer of the technological

knowhow, regular trainings are also conducted for the cooperatives, especially for the personnel

working on the computer based packages.

Figure 193 Assistance to SC & ST Cooperatives

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The financing provided under this component of the scheme, caters to the costs incurred for

hardware, system and application software, networking, technical manpower, maintenance,

infrastructure & site preparation, training & capacity building and also for the technical guidance

required. The following table shows the total allocation done till FY 17-18 towards the

computerization activities across states:

In addition to the computerization process there is also a dedicated MIS team, headed by the Chief

Director, MIS (Figure 190 : Organizational Chart of NCDC) responsible for daily update of the

project activities.

vii. Research and Development

ISAC aimed towards building a robust ecosystem of cooperatives in the agricultural sector of the

country, emphasizes on continual development of its activities both on the financing as well as on

the education and training part. Laxmanrao Inamdar National Academy of Cooperative Research

and Development (LINAC) was established by NCDC as its training and research institute.

Throughout the year multiple training programmes are conducted by LINAC for the personnel

involved in NCDC assisted projects/schemes. Few research studies are also conducted by NCCT

on cooperatives in order to develop them in tandem with the evolving environment, technology

and new requirements in the sector.

Figure 194 State wise cumulative allocation for computerization

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**viii. Unlocking Synergies with other government programmes**

ISAC finds it relevance with one other scheme under the DAC&FW, the Integrated Scheme for

Agricultural Marketing (ISAM). Considering the Indian perspective where, the fulcrum of

monetizing the farmers and their economic wellbeing is a challenge. In order to earn a net profit

by the farmers after selling the agricultural produce, competitive and accessible markets are

required^343. The ISAM tries to bridge this gap by efficiently working towards achieving a holistic

development for the entire agricultural value chain by facilitating the income generation for the

farmers by selling their produce in the markets. The scheme was incorporated in 2013 under the

XII Plan (2012-17).

ISAM also focuses on working with cooperatives by providing them with subsidies for creation of

agriculture marketing infrastructure. The sub component of ISAM, dealing with Agricultural

Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) encourages cooperative sector investments. The funding for

establishment of AMI through ISAM, also gets routed through and implemented by NCDC to the

end beneficiaries i.e. the cooperatives. The scheme also includes renovation of storage

infrastructures only belonging to cooperatives, thus catering to a niche segment, exactly similar

to the target group of ISAC.

Discussion on sector specific thematic assessment

_Sugar Sector Industry_

NCDC has been funding, promoting establishment and developing sugar factories in the

cooperative sector through different schemes. The main aim of this kind of initiative is to enable

the sugarcane farmers get decent market prices for their produce. The key activities undertaken

in this particular initiative are as follows:

• Investment loan assistance to the State Governments to supplement their resources for

equity participation in new co-operative sugar mills.

• Term loan assistance for setting up of new mill and to the existing co-operative sugar mills

for modernization/ expansion of capacity.

• Term loan assistance for establishment of sugar by-product units.

• Margin Money assistance to the existing co-operative sugar mills.

• Short/medium term loan towards working capital requirements of coop. Sugar mills.

NCDC plays a crucial role in routing the funds received from Sugar Development Fund (SDF) to

the individual sugar cooperatives mills.

_Disruptive technology and agri startups, incubations centres_

The Yuva Sahakar Cooperative Enterprise Support and Innovation Scheme, 2019 has been

brought into the picture with NCDC’s efforts to align its activities with national level scheme,

Stand-Up India facilitating young entrepreneurs in the cooperative sector to realize their new and

innovative ideas. The projects which are funded by NCDC in this scheme are under INR 3 crore

for cooperatives which are operational for one year or more and INR 1 crore for cooperatives in

operation for more than three months but less than a year. Working capital loans amounting to a

maximum of 20% of the project cost is sanctioned by NCDC at 2% lower rate than what the

cooperative is getting charged for the term loan received for their project activities. Subsidies are

also provided to these cooperatives once their eligibility is ascertained under the criteria of ISAC.

This subsidy amount also helps in smooth implementation of the project as upfront working

capital loan gets disbursed and adjusted later against the subsidy, once the disbursement is

received by NCDC for onward disbursement from ISAC.

_Linkages with Food Processing Industries_

As India is an agrarian economy, post harvest of the agricultural produce, it is equally important

to process the harvest. NCDC has promoted cooperatives involved in processing of food grains,

plantation crops and oil seeds. The funding has been primarily focused towards the

establishment, modernization, expansion and diversification of agro-based processing units.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Issues and Challenges

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The activities taken up by the cooperatives are fairly limited as most of the activities are  
    related to credit and fertiliser distribution. The scheme guidelines also limit the activities  
    that can be supported under the project. The scheme does not cover the weak areas of  
    cooperative sector. The doubling farming income report highlights lack of prudent  
    interest rate policies, viability of societies, target centric growth, below par governance as  
    the key issues ailing rural cooperative credit societies. In addition, following weak areas  
    have been identified under the cooperatives sector

o Extension and farm advisory support

o Technical human resource for information dissemination and management of

activities

o Linking farmer produce to markets

o Value addition, processing of produce by organising farmers collectives

o Storage and warehousing of agriculture produce and inputs

o Maintaining quality of inputs supplied i.e. seeds, fertilisers, soil recommendation

and water testing

o Farm machinery and custom hiring centres for collective purchase and use of farm

machinery

Figure 195 Assistance provided to food grain processing units in FY 17- 18

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  It was highlighted during the discussion with department officials that there has been  
    significant difference between approved outlay and the actual funds allocated to the  
    scheme in recent years. This impacts scheme’s performance and limits the interventions  
    that have been envisaged under the scheme.
2.  The scheme has categorised states into under developed, least developed and developed  
    states. The extent of subsidy (up to 25%) that can be provided to a cooperative is decided  
    on the category of state. However, it has been observed that the categorisation may limit  
    the extent of support that is needed by the cooperative federation.

B. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  An evaluation study has been conducted for the scheme which is not available in public  
    domain.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions

The key recommendations for the scheme are mentioned below.

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  The scheme may appropriately revised to focus on the weak areas highlighted in issues  
    and challenges section. Consultation with stakeholders can be taken up to prioritize the  
    scope of activities. Guidelines can then be revised and modified to diversify the scope of  
    approved activities. Few important areas where the scheme may focus are as under

o There is need to focus on providing support for processing and marketing of

produce for better price realization. Linkages for selling of produce has been

highlighted as a major concern across all the discussions and is an important

aspect for sustainability. The board members currently lack the required skills for

establishment and management of forward market linkages. Furthermore, there

is need to connect the cooperatives to processing plants in the area for value

added products that can lead to increase in their income.

o Capacity building should be given very high priority. The board of directors mostly

lack the skills to plan for growth of the company. The board members need to be

oriented towards their responsibilities and trained on business development,

financial management, demand and supply management, etc. in order to gain

confidence and be able to discharge their duties effectively.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

o Exposure visits should be facilitated to promote cross-learning amongst farmers

and to promote linkages which will help in sharing of best practices and lead to

sustainability.

o The scheme primarily supports PACS and FPOs are not being supported, it is

suggested to include other farmer producer groups under the scheme.

o The guidelines may further include additional incentives for use of climate

friendly and energy efficient technology.

1.  As this is the only scheme that focus on development of cooperatives, it is important that  
    the funds dispersed should be in line with the requirements and approved outlay for the  
    scheme.
2.  It was highlighted during KIIs that there is need for revisiting the categorisation of states  
    and revising the limits on extent of support to provide some flexibility in the guidelines  
    for operational management and effective implementation.
3.  The schemes also supports processing of raw cotton for export purposes. However, there  
    is a need to strengthen the cotton processing further for better price realisation to  
    farmers.
4.  The scheme has specific components which include Assistance to National Cooperative  
    Development Corporation (NCDC) Programmes for Development of Cooperatives and  
    Assistance to Cooperative Education and Training. While the components are relevant to  
    the scheme’s objectives, it is important to assess the impact of the scheme for long-term  
    development and sustainability of the cooperatives.
5.  The requirements of buyers needs to be matched with the variety of produce by farmers.  
    As highlighted in Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) for World Bank’s  
    District Poverty Initiatives Project (DPIP), in order to achieve better results and outcomes,  
    a better alternative would be to enhance the focus on forward market linkages that  
    provide income opportunities for beneficiaries. With this focus, the following steps should  
    be pursued:

o identify the partners and the products they need to buy;

o develop agreements with the partners;

o identify the skill gaps and give training to beneficiaries to fill up these gaps, and

give them the right kind of materials; and

o go for the production process with the help of partners, and sell the produce to the

partners.

B. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  The evaluation of the scheme may be made available on the public domain
2.  The output-outcome indicators cover most of the components and objectives of the  
    scheme. Further, it is suggested to include outcome indicators in relation to increase  
    in farmers’ income from establishment of cooperatives and percentage of farmers  
    adopting the learnings from trainings delivered to assess overall impact of the scheme.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

The main objectives of the Integrated Scheme on Agricultural Cooperation include:

*   To provide assistance to NCDC for financing the activities of cooperatives like  
    agro-processing, marketing of food grains, input supply, development of weaker  
    section cooperatives, computerization of cooperatives etc.
*   To develop cooperative awareness amongst the people and to cater to the  
    education and training requirements of cooperative personnel and State  
    Government officials dealing with Co-operatives.

Both the above objectives (except NCDC as the agency being assisted) are covered

under the objectives/ activities of Integrated Scheme on Agricultural Marketing (ISAM),

as under:

*   To promote creation of agricultural marketing infrastructure by providing back-  
    ended subsidy support to State, cooperative and private sector investments.
*   To support framing of grade standards and quality certification of agricultural  
    commodities
*   To undertake and promote training, research, education, extension and  
    consultancy in the agri- marketing sector.

Considering the much higher budget allocation of ISAM and to avoid overlap/

duplication of activities, it is desirable to merge ISAC with ISAM with an added

component of assisting NCDC.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

2.2.19 Integrated Scheme on Agriculture Census and Statistics

Background of the Scheme

Accurate and timely data collection related to agriculture activities plays a critical role in overall

development of the sector. The agriculture census is being conducted on a quinquennial basis,

since 1970-71. The information is primarily collected during agriculture census on operational

holdings, land use, cropping pattern, irrigation status, tenancy, size class, input use etc.

**Objectives of the Scheme**^344

The main objectives of integrated scheme on agriculture census and statistics are provided below.

i. Describe the structure and characteristics of agriculture, providing statistical data on

operational holdings, operated area, land utilisation, livestock, agricultural machinery and

implements, use of fertilisers, etc.

ii. Provide benchmark data for formulating new agricultural development programmes and

for evaluating their progress

iii. To provide basic framework of operational holdings and its characteristics for carrying

out future agriculture surveys and

iv. To lay basis for developing integrated programme for current agricultural statistics.

**Implementation Structure**

The states are classified as land record states and non-land record states. At central level the

agriculture census division of the Government of India is responsible for implementation of the

scheme and the responsibility of execution is with the states. Activities of census are monitored

by State Level Coordination Committee (SLCC) headed by State Agriculture Census Commissioner

and representatives of line departments.

The survey is conducted by the States/ UTs in three seasons. The survey undertakes multistage

sampling strategy, starting with village, followed by household and lastly, animals from selected

households. To monitor the progress across states, a steering committee comprising of

representatives from various stakeholders has been formed. The committee is chaired by

additional secretary/ principal adviser, Department of Agriculture and Cooperation with

representatives from Central Statistical Office, department of land resources, NIC, Department of

Animal Husbandry, etc. The steering committee for agriculture census oversees various technical

and monitoring aspects, sampling design, etc.

The census is conducted in three distinct phases and each phase focuses on different aspects. The

first phase focuses on primary characteristics i.e. no of operational holdings, area operated by

different size classes, social groups, gender, and types of holding. This phase covers all villages in

land record states and 20% of villages in non-land record states. The second phase is conducted

in 20% of the villages in all states. It covers important characteristics of land holding i.e. land use,

irrigation, tenancy and cropping pattern. The third phase covers 7% villages in each tehsil of

state/UT. This a comprehensive survey on input use. The three phases of agriculture census and

survey generate following reports.

Phase III All India report on Input surveys

Monthly, quarterly and annual reports are generated. In addition, review meetings on regional

and zonal basis are conducted, field visits are taken up and interaction with stakeholders are done

through video conferencing.

**Intended contribution to sectoral challenges**

Agriculture Census provides critical information that is necessary for use of policy and decision

makers in formulation of schemes and policies for overall development of the sector.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• ISACS provides critical information that is necessary for policy and decision makers in

formulation of schemes and policies, therefore, are highly relevant for the sectoral

development.

• The information is primarily collected during agriculture census on operational holdings,

land use, cropping pattern, irrigation status, tenancy, size class, input use etc.

**Effectiveness**

• Agriculture Census 2015-16 is the 10th census in the series since 1970-71. The survey

provides recent information on status of agriculture in the country.

**Efficiency**

• The budgeted estimates have increased over last 5 years and the allocated budgets have

been fully utilized since 2015-16.

**Sustainability**

• The survey is conducted by the States/ UTs in three seasons. The steering committee for

agriculture census oversees various technical and monitoring aspects, sampling design,

etc.

**Impact**

• Agriculture census provides critical information that is necessary for use of policy and

decision makers in formulation of schemes and policies for overall development of the

sector.

**Equity**

• The census covers various geographies, genders and social groups across the country

without any discrimination.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

The assessment of the cross sectional thematic areas of the scheme has been provided below:

Issues and Challenges

Some of the major issues and challenges in the Scheme are as follows:

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  During KIIs it was highlighted that the quality of data collected during the survey is a  
    major issues. At state level, the information is collected and verified usually by patwari  
    or other ground level staff who are already engaged in various other activities. The  
    staff is usually not able to provide adequate focus on quality of data as it is perceived  
    as an additional task for them.
2.  As many states do not have comprehensive digitised land record system, the  
    validation and collection of data during first two phases gets delayed at many  
    occasions. Data collection during third phase is paper and pen based which also  
    contributes to further delays and inadvertent data entry errors which affects the  
    quality of information and further analysis.
3.  The incentives being provided to ground level staff for coordination of data collection  
    and validation exercise is very low at Rs 2500 per village which also affects their  
    participation and active involvement.
4.  Lack of reliable and comprehensive database of land records across states is a  
    challenge, North eastern states and other major states such as West Bengal, Odisha  
    and Kerala are examples of such states, due to which comprehensive data collection is  
    required even for first and second phase, this becomes a time consuming process.
5.  Shortage of human resources to monitor and implement schemes was highlighted as  
    a concern to expeditiously carry out census activities and meet timelines.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

B. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  While the scheme has a State level Monitoring Committee, at present there is no  
    concurrent third party monitoring system, this impacts the quality of data being  
    collected during the survey.
2.  As the questionnaires on input survey are lengthy, there is little information captured  
    in some surveys which impacts quality.
3.  Critical information such as point of sale of produce and sale price is currently not  
    being captured in census.
4.  Important information related to tenancy available on land records is unreliable as  
    many at times the land is given on lease but is not recorded in the database. In addition  
    the information provided by farmers on agriculture credit during third phase is also  
    found to be inconsistent as farmers are reluctant to divulge exact information to  
    surveyors.

On the basis of the discussion above, the scheme’s issues and challenges have been discussed

below:

Recommendations and Solutions

Below are the key recommendations for the scheme.

A. Governance and Institutional Mechanism

1.  It is recommended to use IT enabled survey response mechanism for conducting the  
    agriculture census and survey. This can help in reducing delays, avoid data entry errors,  
    easier data modelling and facilitate detailed analysis. For example, the 20th Livestock  
    Census has been conducted using a mobile application through which the data collection  
    time was reduced significantly and the preliminary results are also available in public  
    domain.

o The patwari and ground level staff may be trained and provided higher incentives

for maintaining data quality during surveys.

o Appropriate processes may be defined for data collection of all three phases

concurrently for faster completion of survey and efficient utilization of resources.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

1.  A uniform land records database for all states needs be created, the land records in each  
    state capture minimum information required in first and second phase of the survey. Best  
    practices from leading states such as Madhya Pradesh can be emulated by other states.
2.  The financial incentives provided to the staff for validation may be revised and made at  
    par with census of India or other similar census surveys.
3.  Process of digitization of records needs to be sped up in all states, a separate strategy  
    needs to be developed for non-land record states.
4.  The staff availability and requirement at various levels for carrying out timely census and  
    survey needs to be assessed and vacancies if any should be filled in immediately, in  
    addition fixed term contractual appoint of staff can also be promoted to manage shortage  
    of staff.

B. Monitoring and evaluation

1.  Third party concurrent monitoring of data collection exercise needs to be ensured.
2.  The questionnaires on input survey may be appropriately revised to reduce the number  
    of questions for which the information has not been conclusively provided during  
    previous surveys.
3.  Parameters such as point of sale, sale price of produce, etc. needs to be captured during  
    the survey to understand the impact of marketing initiatives and to check the % of farmers  
    who are selling their produce in mandi/ formal markets.
4.  For obtaining accurate information on agriculture credit, the loan disbursed should be  
    integrated with khasra number in land records. This activity has been promoted as part  
    of Business Reform Action Plan and many states have already implemented the same.

Discussion on Scheme Rationalization:

The scheme is highly relevant as it undertakes multistage sampling, starting with

village, followed by household and lastly, animals to describe the structure and

characteristics of agriculture, providing statistical data on operational holdings,

operated area, land utilization, livestock, agricultural machinery and implements, use

of fertilizers etc.

The scheme needs to be continued as it provides information critical for policy making.

App based survey and concurrent monitoring also needs to introduced to maintain data

quality and expedite data collection and analysis.

Background of the Scheme^346

The scheme is being implemented to promote e-Governance in Agriculture at the Centre and to

provide support to States/ UTs for the same.

The main components of the scheme includes.

• Strengthening of IT Apparatus in Agriculture and Cooperation in the States and Union

Territories (AGRISNET) – Central Sector Scheme

• National e-Governance Plan in Agriculture (NeGP-A) – Centrally Sponsored Scheme

_Strengthening of IT Apparatus in Agriculture and Cooperation in the States and Union Territories_

_(AGRISNET)_

The Department has developed around 80 portals, applications and websites (primarily in

collaboration with the National Informatics Centre) covering both the headquarters and its field

offices/directorates. The important portals include Farmers’ Portal SEEDNET, DACNET,

AGMARKNET (prices and arrivals in Mandis), RKVY (Rashtriya Krishi VikasYojana), ATMA, NHM

(National Horticulture Mission), INTRADAC, NFSM (National Food Security Mission) and APY

(Acreage, Productivity and Yield).

Under this Scheme, funds are provided to State/UTs for computerization down to Block level.

Funds to 26 states have been released under AGRISNET to achieve the objective of providing

computers up to Block level. State specific software packages have been developed to disseminate

information to the farmers. Availability of requisite hardware and locally suitable software

packages has resulted in quick retrieval of data, dissemination of information to farmers and

provision of farmer centric services to farmers.

The States/UT’s which have availed assistance under the Scheme are Andhra Pradesh, Madhya

Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Assam, Uttarakhand,

Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Sikkim, Maharashtra, Punjab, Orissa, Mizoram, Kerala,

Haryana, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Puducherry , Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Bihar, and Manipur.

The Kisan Call Centre (KCC) initiative aims to provide information to the farming community

through toll-free telephone lines. Under this project, call centre facilities have been extended to

the farmers through call centres located in different states so that farmers can get the information

in their own language. Recently KCCs have been further revamped by consolidation and

appointing a new service provider for KCC to set up state of the art KCCs at 14 identified locations.

_National e-Governance Plan in Agriculture (NeGP-A)_

The Mission Mode Project has been introduced during last phase of the 11th plan to achieve rapid

development of agriculture in India through the use of ICT for ensuring timely access to

agriculture related information for the farmers of the country. There are a number of current IT

initiatives/schemes undertaken or implemented by Department which are aimed at providing

information to the farmers on various activities in the agriculture value chain. These initiatives

will be integrated so that farmers would be able to make proper and timely use of the available

Source: Information shared by the Department, Annual Report  
Fund allocation has halved since 2016-17, however, the utilisation has improved.  
**Physical Performance**^347  
_MKisan - Use of Basic Mobile Telephony:_  
Department has developed a portal – mkisan (mkisan.gov.in), where more than 5.13 crore  
farmers are registered and experts/scientists of different departments like IMD, ICAR, State  
Government, State Agriculture Universities send information to farmers in 12 local languages.  
Weather information about likelihood of rainfall, temperature, etc. enables farmers to make  
informed decision in choice of seed varieties, decide on timing of sowing and harvesting. With  
market information, farmers are better informed about markets to sell produce, prevailing  
market prices and quantity demanded in the market. Thus, they can make informed decisions to  
sell produce at the right price and right time. This helps reducing distress sales by farmers due to  
market supply fluctuations. Around 2326 crore SMSs have been sent through mkisan since its  
inception in 2013.  
_Farmers’ Portal (www.farmer.gov.in):_  
Farmers’ Portal is a one stop shop for farmers where a farmer can get relevant information on  
range of topics including seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, credit, good practices, dealer network,  
availability of inputs, agromet advisory, animal husbandry etc. This information can be drilled  
down through the pictorial view of Map of India placed on the Home page as well.  
While over 800 websites of various departments and organisations related to Agriculture & allied  
sectors in the Central and State Governments and 80 applications/portals of the Department  
pertained to agriculture & allied sectors from organisational and schematic view-point, not even  
one portal existed for the farmers and that was the genesis of the Farmers’ Portal.  
This centralized repository is the back bone of all mobile apps and SMS advisories. This portal  
provides information across all stages of crop management right from sowing of seeds till post  
harvesting. The beauty of this web based portal is that one can shift down to the block level and  
get the information of particular block  
_Development of Mobile Apps:_  
Various mobile apps have been developed for farmers. Some of them are listed below:  
(^347) Annual Report of Ministry of Agriculture, 2018- 19

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Kisan Suvidha: It is an omnibus mobile app to help farmers by providing relevant information to

them quickly. It has a simple interface and provides information on critical parameters—weather,

input dealers, market price, plant protection, expert advisories, cold storage & godowns, crop

insurance, veterinary centres and diagnostics labs. An additional tab directly connects the farmer

with the Kisan Call Centre where agriculture experts answer their queries.

Unique features like extreme weather alerts and market prices of commodity in nearest area and

the maximum price in state as well as India have been added to empower farmers in the best

possible manner. With click of a button, farmers can get all this information in hand provided they

have a smart phone and decent internet connectivity. Total downloads: 9,85,203.

Pusa Krishi: This Mobile App “PUSA KRISHI’’ has been developed to realize the dream “LAB to

LAND” of our Prime Minister. Indian Agriculture Research Institute, PUSA has developed many

high yielding varieties of Agriculture, Horticulture crops and other path breaking technologies in

the fields of Natural Resources management, Integrated Nutrient management, Plant protection,

Soil and water management, mechanization, diagnostic technologies etc. This app will help

farmers to get information about technologies developed by IARI, which will eventually help in

increasing returns to farmers. This mobile app is also intended towards Agri. Start-ups, industry

partners to whom these technologies will be transferred for further taking it to the farmers. Total

downloads: 40,467.

The funds under the schemes have been spent on purchase of computers, UPS, printers,

development of websites, computer operator deployment at state and district level, customized

web and mobile applications. The scheme also provides financial support to states for recruiting

computer operators.

It is important to note that the applications developed under the scheme are being used by all

states. There is also a fairly uniform distribution of funds across states. Highest funds under the

scheme have been released to Bihar (Rs 14.47 crores) and Tamil Nadu (Rs 14.08 crores), followed

by UP (Rs 13.40 crores) and Odisha (Rs 12.58 crores). In addition, as per the data shared by the

department, unspent balance has been an issue across some states. As on July 2020, the highest

unspent balance of Rs 4.84 crores was pending with the State of Bihar, followed by Gujarat (Rs

2.97 crores), West Bengal (Rs 2.25 crores) and Uttar Pradesh (Rs 1.37 crores).

The targets and achievements on output and outcome indicators are not available for the scheme.

**Discussion on Relevance, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Sustainability, Impact and**

**Equity Framework**

**Relevance**

• The NeGPA component helps in developing IT infrastructure and providing technical

support at state level. The support is also extend for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and

Fisheries sector.

• Customized applications are also being developed at state level through support of the

scheme.

• The Agrisnet portal and various applications help in dissemination of information, crop

and weather advisories to registered farmers,

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Effectiveness**

• This scheme has made an impact as the farmers registered under for m-kisan are

increasing, the use and importance of application is also spreading across states. The

performance also varies across states, southern states have done very well in terms of

utilizing funds. The scheme is also able to extend considerable financial support to states

such as Bihar, UP and Uttarakhand who are relatively weak in IT infrastructure.

**Efficiency**

• The budgeted estimates have halved in recent years. There has been significant difference

between the BE and RE for schemes initial years. This gap has reduced in 2018-19 and

2019 - 20.

**Sustainability**

• More focus needs to be given on improving quality of advisory, localized block specific

solutions can be developed to improve sustainability. The infrastructure development and

integration with can be improved.

**Impact**

• The scheme has helped in strengthening IT infrastructure, which has benefited agriculture

department and state universities. It has very high penetration in southern states like

Tamil Nadu where in almost all farmers have been registered and are receiving advisories

and SMS through the applications

**Equity**

• While some states have received higher funds, almost all states have received support

under the schemes. However, the distribution can be improved in central and western

states.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Issues and Challenges

1.  Reports of bugs, crashing of application and difficulty in app navigations for languages  
    other than English (e.g Tamil) have been reported on the Play Store for Android mobile  
    apps.
2.  The information on market prices of the commodities on the application also appears to  
    be a few days old across the commodities.
3.  There is great scope of improvement on information provided on the application, e.g.  
    information on plant protection is limited for few crops, information on cold storages is  
    not updated, etc.
4.  In addition to application and website development, funds have been provided to states  
    for upgrading IT infrastructure. However, the states were largely asking financial support  
    for purchase of IT and electronic equipment and none of the states have requested funds  
    for unique/ innovative interventions.

Recommendations and Solutions

1.  The customer support desk needs to take up these complaints and update the status of  
    bug fixes on the Play Store. The issue of difficulty in navigation for other languages needs  
    to be resolved quickly for mass acceptability of application.
2.  The information on market prices of the commodities should ideally be integrated with  
    agmarknet portal and updated daily for all mandis available on agmarknet. Access can be  
    provided to mandi samiti members who should be directed to update the daily prices of  
    commodities on the mobile application, the farmers who have sold the commodity may  
    also be given access where they can update the rates at which they have sold the  
    commodity in the market
3.  The information updation is a constant cycle, services of sector experts and scientist can  
    be taken up for updating technical, agricultural related information on the application in  
    easy to read mobile based format. Information on plant protection along with videos or  
    link to videos, good agriculture practices along with demonstration videos can become a  
    very useful tool for farmers.
4.  It has been informed that the department is in process of revising its guidelines, wherein  
    support will be provided to states for unique IT related interventions such as use of  
    machine learning and AI for crop advisory and price related information, etc.
5.  Quality of state portals needs to be monitored and block specific recommendations have  
    to be provided through the scheme, information on availability of inputs nearest input  
    stores, updated daily market rates of commodities^348
6.  Need to engage private stakeholders have been highlighted to strengthen the scheme. It  
    also highlighted the need for developing capacity of local extension workers and initiating  
    training of trainer programmes for functionaries,

3.2 Recommendations at Sectoral Level

Post consultations with the department officials at central, state and district level; sector experts;

and our analysis of the issues and challenges faced by the agriculture sector, the

recommendations and solutions have been provided below across the Value Chain.

**Production**

• Quality seeds, planting material, fertilisers, pesticides, insecticides and bio-fertilisers are

critical for sustained production of agriculture and horticulture activities. Non availability

of quality seeds has been a major constraint which impact production and yield of key

agricultural commodities. Thus, ensuring availability of quality inputs is critical which

needs to be addressed. This should be supplemented by capacity building of farmers on

various aspects of seed treatment, time of sowing and treatment of soil before sowing, etc.

to ensure disease free production of crops. More focus is also necessary on enhancing

quality seed production and development of nurseries to ensure timely availability of

quality planting materials. Optimal use of fertilizers (including micro-nutrients) and

pesticides should also be encouraged based on soil testing before the start of every crop

season. Bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides should be promoted considering the high

environmental impacts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

• As mentioned, majority of FPOs (including FPCs) in India are at a nascent stage of their

operations. They mostly assist the member farmers in input supply although some are

also engaged in aggregation of the produce from the members. However, there is a need

to assist the development of these FPOs into a functioning business enterprise. The FPOs

may be encouraged to widen their scope of services in the lines of agribusiness centres

which should operate as an one stop destination for all the production and marketing

needs of the member farmers including sale of agri inputs and services, procurement and

primary processing, storage and marketing.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Box 10 : Abhinav's Farmers' Club

• There is a sub-optimal utilization of irrigation in the country. Adequate maintenance of

canal system, participatory management, changing land use pattern, following the

designated cropping pattern, reduction of soil degradation and timely command area

development would increase the utilization of irrigation potential. Promotion of water

efficient irrigation such as micro irrigation should be actively promoted especially in the

water scarce areas.

• As discussed earlier, the issue of water availability in agriculture is aggravated owing to

the current cropping system in the country. High proportion of cultivated area under

water intensive crops like rice, sugarcane etc. is not well managed through water efficient

irrigation systems. Diversification from rice and sugarcane to crops such as millets, maize,

pulses and oilseeds are recommended considering the low water requirement of the later

Abhinav Farmers’ Club

A group of 12 progressive farmers formed the Abhinav Farmers’ Club in Pune

district of Maharashtra under the guidance of National Bank for Rural Development

(NABARD), in the year 2004. These farmers were involved in cultivation of roses

and carnations under protected conditions of a poly house. The Farmers’ Club

enabled the individual farmers to aggregate the produce and market it effectively in

Mumbai and Delhi. The functions of production, logistics, marketing, branding were

divided among the different members of the group. Gradually more farmers started

becoming members of the club and the membership grew to more than 300.

However, all the member farmers practiced floriculture, which resulted in excess

supply and eventually led to reduced margins for the member farmers.

Abhinav Farmers’ Club then developed an innovative 1-acre hi-tech integrated

organic farming concept, in which the farmers would grow different types of fruits,

leafy vegetables, exotic vegetables and pulses. Abhinav Farmers’ Club has also tied

up with women Self Help Groups, who help in grading, packaging and delivery of

the produce at the doorstep of the consumers. This is an integrated model, which

focuses on growing a diverse set of products (in smaller quantities) needed every-

day by the consumers and supplying them directly to the end-consumers. The USP

of this model is that the high quality organic produce is directly marketed to the

retail consumers, thereby eliminating all the intermediaries. This ensures higher

margins to the member farmers.

The current membership of Abhinav Farmers’ Club is not just limited to Pune, but

has spread to six states of the country, viz. Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra

Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. The total membership is close to

1.5 lakh farmers, who produce organic fruits, vegetables, pulses on a 1-acre plot

each and directly supply to end consumers. The coordination amongst these

member farmers is facilitated through farmer leaders from each group (257 farmer

leaders across the country), which are connected through a WhatsApp group and

meet once in three months. Abhinav Farmers’ Club provides the technical expertise

regarding production and marketing of the produce to the new member farmers

through the farmers’ leaders. Thus, it has been able to reach a membership of

around 1.5 lakh farmers.

crops. Low water consuming crops such as maize, pulses & oilseeds should be promoted

replacing rice, sugarcane, banana, cotton etc. in over-exploited regions.

• Awareness generation among farmers on proper use of irrigation water at critical stages

of crop growth under different soil and environment conditions should be undertaken.

• In India, there has been slow

uptake of farm mechanization,

particularly among small and

marginal farmers. Considering the

expected drop of percentage of

agricultural workers in total work

force in India, it is critical that farm

mechanization is actively

promoted. Considering the cost

involved in farm mechanization, it

is recommended that the FPOs can

also be promoted as equipment

banks which would enable small

and marginal farmers to have

access to such equipment at a low

cost. Moreover, the private sector

can be roped in for provision of

such services. Innovative business

models such as digital sharing

platforms of farm equipment (Uber

model) may be promoted. This will

not only provide easy access to

farm equipment for the smaller farmers but would also increase the utilization of

equipment owned by the farmers when not being used in their own farms.

**Processing and Value Addition**

• Upgradation of Storage and Transparent Price Discovery Infrastructure at Mandi level can

assist in processing, value addition and marketing. There is a need to upgrade and

promote modern dry storage to cater to various agricultural crops linked with the

warehouse receipt financing facility. This would enable the smallholder farmers to store

their produce and take advantage of the increased rates after few months of the harvest

season. This would prevent the distress selling and help them get better gains from the

market. Also, due to the warehouse receipt facility the farmers would be able to avail loans

at affordable rates for their different financial needs.

• In case of most crops, the prices are determined by the moisture and foreign material

content and oil content in oilseeds. However, scientific testing facilities are mostly not

available at the markets and the traders rely on visual methods and physical handling to

estimate the moisture, foreign material and oil content. Thus, the price discovery

mechanisms are skewed in favor of the traders and the farmers end up getting less price

for their produce. Thus, in order to promote transparent price discovery, it is

recommended that enabling infrastructure in the form of Cleaning Grading Machines,

Moisture Meters, Oil Content Analyzer, etc. are established in major markets. For instance,

renting is stated to be over $5 billion, while

in case of milk, dairy farmers are able to get fair price realization through milko-testers

installed at the point of sale and the process is transparent. It is proposed to create such

transparent price discovery infrastructure in major agricultural produce markets in the

country.

• Similarly, grading machines can be installed for horticultural products. After grading and

sorting, the table grades can be transported to the retail markets/ retailers and

processing grade can be moved to processing centres.

• Moreover, irradiation facilities can also be established to increase the shelf life of both

grains, pulses and some of the horticulture crops to reduce/ eliminate storage pests.

• Encourage appropriate/ innovative packaging (for instance, modified atmosphere

packaging, biodegradable packaging, etc.) to minimize losses.

• Capacity building of farmers and farmer collectives on improved harvest and post-harvest

practices. For example, in the case of Bananas, farmers need to be trained on the use of

foam padding/ bubble wraps to prevent injury to the harvested banana bunch. Similarly,

the hands need to be dipped in alum solution for prevention of sap flow on the peels to

prevent black spots. Similarly, farmers need to be trained on appropriate harvesting and

post-harvesting practices such as optimal time of harvest, storage temperature, quality

indices, maturity indices, injuries, handling protocols, post-harvest injuries and decays,

ripening process and use of ripening agents, use of right packaging, transportation impact

etc. for other crops as well for better value realization and reducing damage to the

produce.

Box 12 : Use of Nets for harvesting fruits

**Credit and Insurance**

• Access to finance and Creation of Seed Capital/ Venture Capital Fund. Availability of

timely credit (both term loans and working capital) from banks and other financial

institutions is a major challenge. The majority of banks and other financial institutions

generally seek a minimum collateral of about 150% to 200% of loan value from the

Use of Nets for harvesting fruits

Majority of the mango growers do not use the mango harvester to harvest the

fruits. The fruits are harvested by beating the branches with bamboo poles or

climbing the tree and vigorously shaking the branches, making the fruits fall

onto the ground. As a result, barring the fruits, which are on lower branches,

the other fruits are either bruised or damaged during the harvesting process.

Such practices result in direct/indirect wastage of almost 10%-15% of the

fruits, when compared to the harvesting done by adopting scientific harvesting

practices.

One reason cited for not using the mango harvester is that, the process is

time consuming and requires more labor to do it. Considering this, nets can

be used under the canopy of the trees, so that the fruits are collected in them

and the physical injury to the fruits is prevented. This practice can be

promoted as a better harvesting practice among the farmers.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

farmers/ farmer collectives/ enterprises/ start-ups. Moreover, difficulty in accessing

working capital loan, many times forces the farmer to avail loans from informal sources,

which typically involves high costs. For e.g., the potato farmers are primarily dependent

on cold storage owners for informal credits, as access to formal credits is limited and

warehouse receipt financing facility is mostly not available. These informal loans are

provided at 18% to 24% per annum depending upon the mutual understanding and

negotiation between the farmer and the cold storage owner.

• Moreover, most of the Government Subsidy Schemes are credit linked, such as Cold Chain

Scheme, Scheme for Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages and Scheme for

Creation/ Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities (Ministry of Food

Processing Industries) term loan of a certain percentage of the project cost is a mandatory

eligibility criterion. Many of the farmer collectives and other smaller agribusiness

companies are unable to apply under these subsidy schemes for creation of processing,

storage and value addition infrastructure due to their inability to raise bank loans.

Considering this, it is recommended that the government may consider creating agri-

business/ agri-processing fund which provided soft loans (both term and working

capital) at 4-5% interest rates to farmer collectives and agri-business private companies.

• The agri-enterprises (especially the start-ups) which are operating and planning to

operate have an acute need for seed / venture capital along with business/ enterprise

incubation. Some of the existing funding and incubation programs have been quite

successful in the state. For e.g., the INVENT programme has received encouraging

response and several agri-startups have been funded and incubated under this

programme. Also, recently India Agritech Incubation Network has been setup at IIT-

Kanpur with a target to impact almost 50,000 farmers through 60 enterprises working on

technological solutions for agriculture. There is need for such seed/ venture capital along

with business/ enterprise incubation to provide a supportive environment to improve

their business, entrepreneurial and marketing skills along with low cost funding.

• Agricultural/ Crop Insurance has not taken off as envisaged. There have been multiple

issues including high

premium, limited coverage

of crops, limited percolation

geography – higher in South

India vs North and East

India, limited interest of

insurance service

providers, etc. Horticultural

crops typically have been

excluded from PMFBY.

Thus, there is a need to

enhance the scope of

insurance to cover all crops including horticultural, plantations and spice crops. For

instance, in Uttar Pradesh, the cultivation area of Betel Leaf is roughly 1,000 hectares and

the rain has destroyed 80% of the crop. However, Betel Leaf farming is considered as

horticulture crop and not as agriculture and crop insurance does not cover it. Therefore,

farmers in the state engaged in Betel Leaf farming have suffered heavy losses^350.

• Moreover, the risk has increased for private insurance companies because the number of

farmers covered under the scheme has not increased over the years. In 2016-17, more

than 58 million farmers were covered under the scheme, which dropped to around 56

million in 2018-19. This has pushed the scheme’s premium as can be seen from the figure

alongside.

**India Agritech Incubation Network**  
Recently, India Agritech Incubation Network (IAIN) has been setup at IIT-Kanpur with a  
target to impact almost 50,000 farmers through 60 enterprises working on technological  
solutions for agriculture. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and Tata Trusts, in  
collaboration with Collectives for Integrated Livelihood Initiatives (CInI) and the  
Government of Uttar Pradesh, have jointly set up the IAIN. It aims to provide incubation  
support to innovators and agritech entrepreneurs, to come up with innovative technological  
solutions to positively impact the lives of smallholder farmers in the state of Uttar Pradesh.  
Under this initiative, the Social Alpha Quest for Agritech Innovations has been announced in  
July 2019. In the first phase, around 12 innovations are proposed to be selected, which  
would receive incubation support for the next 1-2 years. The initiative would aim to bring  
about new technological innovations in the following areas:

*   Improving productivity and yield intensification
*   Better post-harvest loss management and value-addition
*   Enhancing access to market and improving traceability

The interest of private players is diminishing in the scheme due to high risks and this can

weaken the overall efforts. This may also increase the risk burden of the government

companies (already 5 government-run companies under the scheme cover over 50% of

the disaster-prone areas) and

the overall claim ratio of the

government companies in the

past three years have been

substantially higher (86%) than

the private players (77%). In

case, the remaining players also

increase the premium amount

to compensate for the higher risk, it may make farmers unsure of the benefits from crop

insurance scheme^351. Therefore, the number of farmers under the scheme need to be

increased to cover the entire country for long-term sustainability of the scheme.

• There is a need to revisit both the contours of the scheme and its implementation in its

current form. It is proposed that the scope of crop insurance be widened to cover potential

crop income/ livelihood rather than just crop inputs. It may also be considered to focus

on providing insurance to collectives for more widespread coverage and reduced

operational expenditure of service providers.

**Marketing**

• There is need to encourage market development through initiatives such as promotion of

digital e-market places, direct linkages with emerging agribusiness markets/ private

players, export promotion, etc.

• Emerging agribusiness players and exporters need to be supported in developing market

linkages or connecting with buyers in the international market and in turn benefiting the

farmers. Therefore, such private sector agri-businesses which need critical support for

enhancing marketing and promotion of their produce in both domestic and export

markets, are suggested to be supported for availing professional services for these

activities provided they procure certain prescribed percentage of their raw material

directly from the farmer collectives.

• Industry led, crop specific market promotion and R&D associations may be promoted on

the lines of American Soybean Association, US Dry Peas and Lentils Council, Horticulture

Innovation Fund Australia, etc. supported in equal measures by the Government.

• Effective marketing linkages for farmer collectives including branding need to be

developed. As mentioned earlier, the major constraint faced by the farmers and their

collectives is the lack of effective market linkages. As a result, the farmer collectives are

not able to get better price realization for the produce. The farmer collectives can be

provided handholding support to develop market linkages with agribusiness companies,

modern retailers, processors and exporters.

• Different brands can be developed for the focus crops based on the geographical

specialties, along with appropriate and attractive packaging. GI indicators based

marketing can be promoted for higher value creation (e.g. Malihabadi Mangoes, Banarasi

Langda, Govind Bhog Rice, Bydagi Chillies, etc.).

• There is an urgent need for training on e-marketplaces/ auctions and other digital

marketing services. Incentives can be provided to buyer and sellers who would trade

through e-market place such as e-NAM to encourage and popularize the usage of e-trading

Case Study: Hort Innovation (Australia)

Background: Hort Innovation is grower-owned, not-for-profit research and development

corporation for Australia's horticulture industry. Each year, investment of more than $100

million in R&D, marketing and trade programs is made on behalf of industry to improve

the productivity, farm gate profitability and global competitiveness of specific industries,

and Australian horticulture as a whole.

Funding: Hort Innovation's investments are funded by grower levies and Australian

Government contributions, as well other industry contributions and co-investment.

Industry Insights : For investments in R&D, marketing and trade, Hort Innovation

consults with growers through industry-specific Strategic Investment Advisory Panels.

Partnership : Hort Frontiers strategic partnership initiative has been developed by Hort

Innovation to better equip Australian horticulture farmers for the future ahead by

facilitating collaborative cross-industry investments.

Hort Frontiers invests funds from a wide range of co-investors, as well as Australian

Government contributions. Strategic co-investment partners can be any entities that want

to invest in the future of horticulture – including commercial businesses, research

agencies, government departments and education institutions.

Learnings : Similar initiatives for promotion of marketing and R&D led by industry players

and farmer groups, supported by Government may be formed focusing on different sub-

sectors in agriculture sector.

platform. Such awareness generation initiatives should be undertaken by the State

Governments as well.

**Research and Development**

• To promote innovations, it is proposed to create an R&D fund to develop innovative

solutions/ technologies for post-harvest management and develop commercial models

for such innovations. The Government needs to encourage innovation and collaboration

in the sector with a fund available for R&D projects that will help the sector remain

profitable and sustainable into the future. The fund should enable industry to partner

with research organizations on projects that use new technologies and techniques for

improving overall economic performance. The projects funded by the fund should include

applied R&D that is innovative and likely to improve farm performance and that will

improve market access/ business diversification.

• Leading research institutions/ organizations can be engaged for such R&D. Collaborations

with foreign universities/ research organizations may also be encouraged. Development

of innovations such as low-cost solar/ biomass powered small pre-coolers and cold

storages at the farm level, packaging based on bio-polymers derived from renewable

sources, low cost ethylene dispensers for uniform and healthy ripening of fruits, and

advanced modified atmosphere packaging etc. can be encouraged.

**Policy Level Interventions**

• It is important to note that the despite the increase in agricultural production, the overall

contribution of agriculture and allied sector in overall GVA has been consistently

declining since 2012-13. This diminishing trend is a concern as agriculture still is the

primary source of livelihood for more than 58% HHs in rural India and provides

employment to 43.9% of country’s total workforce. However, with reducing economic

importance of agriculture, more people are shifting away from agriculture as the total

share of employment in agriculture has declined from 51.1% in 2010 to 43.9% in 2018.

One of the primary reasons towards this shift may be attributed to increasing cost of

production and wide gap between farm-gate price and consumer prices, as only a small

share of consumer price reaches farmers^352. One of the other fallouts of reduced income

from agriculture has been outmigration to urban and peri-urban areas which has led to

unplanned urbanization and associated socio-economic issues. Considering this, there is

an urgent need to make agriculture more viable through specific policy interventions.

• The budgeted estimates for umbrella scheme (including PMKSY-PDMC) has increased

from about Rs. 14924 Crores in 2016-17 to about Rs. 17930 crores in 2018-19. However,

in all the years, the budget estimates have been reduced by about 17% in revised

estimates. In 2019-20, the BE has reduced by about 10.32% from that of 2018-19.

• The reduction in BE for umbrella scheme between 2018-19 and 2019-20 is in contrast to

the trend in allocation for central sector schemes/projects. The BE for key Central Sector

Schemes/projects for DACFW^353 has increased by more than three times from Rs. 28200

in 2018 - 19 to Rs. 1.138 lakh crores in 2019- 20. This increase is mainly driven by budget

allocation of Rs 75,000 crores towards Income Support Scheme. In addition to the Income

(^352) Doubling farmer’s income volume-I and Volume-IV

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Support Scheme, the interest subsidy for short term credit to farmers (Rs 18,000 crores)

and Crop Insurance Scheme (Rs 14,000 crores) are other major components of budgeted

expenditure for DACFW.

• Given the diversity and range of challenges that the agriculture sector faces today in India

viz. increasing production cost, depleting ground water resources, reducing availability

of water, declining soil quality, scarcity of quality agriculture inputs^354 , low productivity,

reducing crop diversity, climate change, increasing land degradation and most

importantly low price realisation to farmers^355. The interventions under the umbrella

scheme of Green revolution and PMKSY can help in overcoming these challenges.

Therefore, it is critical to give high importance to the umbrella schemes as well for

achieving sustainable livelihood growth in rural areas.

• It has been observed that many times that the schemes are unable to perform as per the

expectations due to lack of or delayed contribution of funds by the State Governments.

This is mostly due to fiscal situation of the State Governments and their own development

priorities. Considering this, it is recommended that some of the major schemes (or specific

components of the schemes) which are critical for the growth of the sector may be funded

as Central Sector Schemes.

• As mentioned earlier, horticulture contributes more than a third of the agricultural GDP,

though it occupies less than a fifth of the cultivated area and is expected to increase

further fuelled by high demand for fresh fruits and vegetables. Significant progress has

been made in area expansion under horticulture resulting in higher production. Over the

last decade, the area under horticulture grew by about 2.6% per annum and annual

production increased by 4.8%^356. Horticulture is also garnering greater importance as it

contributes to nutritional security as well than only food security. A cost-benefit study by

ICRIER, has indicated that it is more profitable to cultivate fruits and vegetables than

cereals. It is important to generate optimal output and income through reallocation of

land, keeping in mind the both food and nutritional security, domestic demand and export

opportunities. Diversification to more profitable crops can improve the economic

conditions of small and marginal farmers, especially in areas where the profitability of

food grain cultivation has reduced. Thus, there is a need to give more focus to the growth

of the horticulture sub-sector.

o However, the focus on production and productivity increase in horticulture has to

be supplemented by developing appropriate post-harvest infrastructure along the

value chain. This is particularly important, as various studies have indicated post-

harvest losses of fruits and vegetables in India are very high- ranging from 4.5%

to almost about 44% for different fruits and vegetables. The losses are higher in

states with poor connectivity and infrastructure. As mentioned earlier, there are

severe gaps in post-harvest infrastructure and logistics in many parts of the

country which contribute to the post-harvest losses.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

o This also gets exacerbated by the fact that the current production is highly

fragmented due to lower landholding which does not support individual farm

level infrastructure. Therefore, it is recommended that a cluster based approach

for integrated value chain development of horticulture should be adopted as it

would provide certain economies of scale and lower marginal cost of operations.

In this approach, the major horticulture production clusters should be identified

and linked to consumer markets. In the identified clusters, end-to-end value chain

development should be promoted that would include production/ productivity

improvement through GAP/ organic cultivation, development of post-harvest

infrastructure including storage, processing and transportation, assistance in

certification and developing linkages with the large domestic and export markets.

• There is a need to develop an on-going real time surveillance mechanism linked to early

warning systems for crop pests and diseases to take pre-emptive measures. A real-time

MIS with open access should be developed which would support the pest and disease

control interventions in line with GAP.

• Enhanced focus needs to be given to develop the farmer collectives into commercially

viable business enterprises that would not only engage in production but also set up value

addition facilities in terms of pack houses, innovative cold stores and processing facilities

at the farm-gate. Thus, the farmer collective enterprises would need professional

handholding support for all business aspects like operational, financial and technical

services. In activity terms, it would translate into professional expertise for developing

business and marketing plans, planning the investment – one time vis a vis phased inflow,

market linkages, identification and selection of appropriate technology, partners,

linkages, networks and service providers (legal, accounting, secretarial, sales &

marketing, finance, human resources, tax planning etc.), leadership training, book

keeping, etc. The main objective of these activities would be to develop entrepreneurship

in the farmer collectives and helping them run successful enterprise. There would also be

a focus on promoting new farmer collectives for the focus crops, based upon the

presence/ absence of such collectives in major production clusters of the focus crops.

Key Recommendations at the Sector Level for Achieving Transformational Improvements

Across the Value Chain

• As mentioned earlier, in India, adoption of GAP is at a nascent stage. There are several challenges

in implementing Good Agricultural Practices in aspects such as seed and sowing, seed priming,

precision planting techniques, and using improved farm machinery. Studies have revealed lack of

awareness of critical GAPs among farmers is very low. There is a need to develop a comprehensive

crop-wise and agro-climatic zone-wise Package of Practices (PoPs) on GAP along with crop

specific calendars outlining activities to be undertaken. The PoPs should to be widely

disseminated using a mix of extension mechanisms and information technology (such as online

portals, mobile apps, etc.) for ensuring increased awareness and adoption by the farmers.

Promotion of Public-Private-Community Partnership (PPCP) approaches in agricultural

extensions can lead to larger coverage of such activities. Master trainers from within the farming

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

communities need to be identified and trained who would train the other farmers in GAP. This

would lead to wider outreach and faster adoption.

• Promotion of better and hi-tech farm management practices such as precision farming which can

accurately manage variations in the field to increase productivity and optimizing resource use.

The field variations and requirements are monitored using information technology and tools such

as GPS, sensors, robotics, drones, variable rate technology, GPS-based soil sampling, automated

hardware, telematics, etc. These should be promoted on export oriented farms growing high

value crops. Some private sector agri companies/ startups have already ventured into this space.

• There is a need to involve private sector participation through innovative mechanisms in

development of post-harvest infrastructure including processing. One of the initiatives apart from

ongoing schemes on this aspect could be creation of incubation cum product development centres

where entrepreneurs can test new product/ value added products without incurring capital

expenses on plant and machinery and pilot the products in the market before launching full-

fledged commercial operations.

• There is a need to shift the focus from “traditional and subsistence agriculture” to “market led and

export oriented production”. In spite having the second largest agricultural production in the

world, India’s share of agricultural export is only 2.2% of the world’s agricultural exports as of

1.  There has been low acceptability of many Indian agricultural products in the international  
    markets due to quality issues and lack of traceability. This can be addressed by promoting GAP  
    and quality-based efficient production systems, traceability and certification, development of  
    modern post-harvest infrastructure and logistics with export market as a target to increase  
    India’s share in the global agricultural products trade.

• Climate resilient agriculture should be one of the thrust areas. Highly nutritious crops which are

native to particular agro-climatic zone should be promoted. For example, millets which are

drought resistant to large extent.

• India accounts for only about 4% of global water resources, but supports 18% of the World’s

human population. India’s per capita water availability is constantly steadily declining due to

population growth. According to estimates of Doubling Farmer’s Income report, India will be a

water stressed country on the basis of per capita water availability in 2050 with only 686 cubic

meter per year. Water required for irrigation purpose is estimated at around 75-85 per cent share

in the total demand by the Standing Sub-Committee of MoWR. With over 80% of the total water

in the country being used in agriculture, measures need to be taken for sustainable usage. Thus,

there is a need for focussed efforts on water conservation in agriculture. Interventions such as

micro-irrigation (PMKSY-PDMC), etc. needs to be supplemented with conservation mechanisms

such as mulching, development and maintenance of water conservation structures, watershed

management, etc. Higher allocations should be considered on water conservation efforts/

interventions.

• Technical support groups involving multi-disciplinary team needs to be created for project

management, planning and implementation at the central and state level. Fixed term contracts/

tenures for scheme level officials for 3-4 years with yearly performance linked appraisal may be

introduced for higher accountability.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

3.3 Synthesis of Schemes/ Umbrella Level Recommendations

Post consultations with the department officials at central, state and district level; sector experts;

and our analysis of the issues and challenges faced in implementation of the Umbrella Scheme,

the recommendations and solutions have been provided below on the parameters of Governance,

Monitoring & Evaluation, Fund flow Efficiency and Capacity Building at Umbrella CSS level.

**Governance and Institutional Mechanism**

• Most of the schemes have been found to be relevant to address the needs of the sector.

For example, the RAD scheme adopts an area based approach for development and

conservation of natural resources along with farming systems, using a ‘watershed plus

framework’. Similarly, RKVY-RAFTAAR aims at making farming a remunerative economic

activity through strengthening the farmer effort, risk mitigation and promoting agri-

business entrepreneurship.

• However, there is a need to restructure/ merge certain schemes and/ or activities therein

for convergence, better implementation and avoiding duplication. For example, MIDH and

Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) have common components of farm

mechanization. Similarly, RKVY allows different types of economic activities which may

overlap with many of the schemes. The opportunities for rationalization and convergence

of schemes have been detailed in later sections of the report.

• It has been observed that in some schemes, the progress is not uniform for all the covered

component/ activities. For example, the involvement/ promotion of FPOs/ FIGs in several

schemes have not been adequate as compared to the other components of these schemes.

This uneven progress makes it difficult for the schemes to achieve their full objectives. It

is recommended that adequate focus should be given to ensure uniformity in progress

across components within a scheme.

• There may be a need to expand some of the schemes components to make them more

comprehensive and relevant. For example, in National Bamboo Mission, while the scheme

objective focus on product and skill development to suit the market need, but it lacks

emphasis on creation of effective backward and forward linkages of the farmers/

producer groups with the markets/ processors. Therefore, it is suggested that scheme

objectives/ component should be expanded to support aggregation of farmers into farmer

groups/ FPOs/ FPCs/ SHGs & also facilitating their tie-ups with market aggregators and

financial institution. Similarly, in case of PMKSY-PDMC, there is a need to include capacity

building through training of beneficiaries on the operation and maintenance of micro

irrigation systems as it has been found to be a bottleneck for adoption.

• Standardization of implementation plan and process across schemes needs to be

undertaken to reduce ambiguity within the implementing agencies.

• Schemes supporting creation of value addition infrastructure may be positioned under

central sector schemes rather than centrally sponsored schemes. Experiences of different

schemes across sectors lead to conclusion that hard interventions such as value addition

infrastructure, processing facilities, etc. have better performance when directly

implemented by the central government. For instance, cold-chain interventions under

direct implementation by MOFPI were found more effective vis-à-vis similar

interventions under NMFP which was implemented through the states.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• The development of physical infrastructure under various schemes needs to be supported

with components on maintenance and upkeep of these structures. For example, in case of

PMKSY, even though the scheme had a component focussing on Repair, Restoration and

Renovation of existing structures, these were not focussed during implementation. As a

result water bodies/structures covering only 6066.74 hectares i.e. less than 2% of SWMA

interventions and less than 0.5% of overall interventions, have been renovated during

last 5 years.

• Significant variations are present in terms of implementation structure, processes,

guideline formats and document across schemes. Standardization of implementation plan

and process across schemes needs to be undertaken to reduce ambiguity within the

implementing agencies. For example, in case of SMAE, the scheme has a well-defined

monitoring structure in place, with implementing and monitoring agencies at the levels

of state, district, block and village, to ensure that the extension reforms reach the ground-

level. However, the existence of multiple agencies slows down decision-making and

hinders fast-tracking of critical projects. A robust centralized ICT-enabled mechanism

needs to be implemented which can help in smooth monitoring and help in better analysis

of information. The current MIS (ERMS) has very limited data and falls short of

expectation on effective monitoring for the scheme.

• Some of the activities under the scheme provide one-time physical and/ or financial

support where the beneficiaries are able to benefit, however, due to lack of ecosystem to

support such interventions may not be sustainable. For instance, PMKSY-PDMC provides

support for installation of MI systems, however, there are many instances of clogging of

emitters, damage caused by rodents, poor quality of products, high installation cost, poor

after-sales service, delays in loan and subsidy approvals, and lack of technical support

which act as obstacles to adoption of micro irrigation by the farmers. Therefore, after-

sales services network needs to be strengthened for sustainability of the system once

adopted.

• There is need to engage with private sector for development of agriculture sector and

their participation in agriculture marketing should be supported by the states by

encouraging them to engage in contract farming models, allowing direct marketing,

rationalization of market fee, and attracting agencies to take up development of market

infrastructure.

• FPOs/ FPCs need adequate handholding and relevant training in order to operate their

business and subsequently grow their earning for benefit of members. It is important to

provide training to board of directors of FPOs/ FPCs on financial, managerial, operational

aspects for long term sustainability of the companies being formed under various

schemes.

• Provision for social audit of activities needs to be incorporated within the schemes.

• There is generally no specific preference for any gender in enrolment of new members.

Specific incentives for women should be included under the schemes to promote their

participation.

• Geo-tagging should be mandated for interventions, especially for the infrastructure

projects. For instance, under RKVY, geo-tagging of infrastructure projects is yet to be

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

undertaken in many states, mainly due to poor internet connectivity, inadequate human

resource, lack of funds, and insufficient skills.

**Monitoring and Evaluation**

• There is a need to revisit the output and outcome indicators and the measures thereof to

reflect the intended objectives in entirety. For example, in case of Sub Mission on

Agriculture Extension (SMAE), the number of trained farmers adopting learned new

technologies should be used as outcome indicator instead of number of farmers trained.

Similarly, in case of RAD scheme, there are no output indicators for activities such as

fisheries based farming systems, agro-forestry, value added resource conservation

system, water harvesting and related activities, demonstrations, post-harvest activities,

etc. In PMKSY-PDMC, an outcome indicator of savings in water consumption as a direct

measure of water use efficiency can be included. In case of RKVY, the output / outcome

framework of the Scheme should be revisited to include indicators to reflect the intended

objectives in entirety and tracking the progress of projects implemented under the

Scheme, such as:

o No. of beneficiaries impacted (category-wise)

o Increase in area/ production/ productivity of focus commodity

o Average increase in beneficiary income

o Number/capacity of infrastructure created

o Entrepreneurs supported

o Increase in private sector investment, etc.

An example of well aligned output-outcome framework is given below for one of the

agriculture projects under implementation in Bihar.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

Box 15 : Infographic on Project under Implementation by Govt. of Bihar, Agriculture Department

• In most of the schemes, although there is MIS in place, however, real time data capture is

lacking. The information related to release of funds, delays in time taken for approvals is

mostly not available which makes it difficult for assessment of effectiveness of various

schemes. For effective monitoring and implementation, real time data monitoring

mechanisms need to be established with convergence at all level from village to the

national level and capacity building needs to be undertaken at different levels for data

input and management.

• Moreover, convergence in real time MIS between complementing schemes such as SMAE

with RKVY, MIDH, NFSM, etc. needs to be established to measure effectiveness and also

for collaborative planning and leveraging of resources.

• Independent third party monitoring mechanisms should be made mandatory to avoid

biases and validation of the progress.

• Reporting on outcome indicators needs to be made mandatory as these are a measure of

both effectiveness and impacts. This can be supplemented with biennial evaluations for

course correction.

• Moreover, output and outcome indicators also need to incorporate qualitative measures

along with quantitative data. For instance, under MIDH, one of the output indicator is the

number of cold stores established, where the corresponding qualitative indicators should

be the technology used (in terms of humidity control and power efficiency), use of

renewable energy, capacity utilization (both in terms of tonnage and period of usage), etc.

• Most of the schemes do not have baselines. This results in only incremental progress/ at

times contradictory progress picture emerging.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Field level observations indicate that multiple schemes are handled by single person/ a

small team which results in dilution of focus/ priorities. Therefore, the schemes should

have in-built provision for engaging third party professional programme managers to

assist the central and state implementing agencies in planning, implementation and

monitoring.

• Periodic evaluations need to be in-built in the implementation strategy of the schemes

including flexibility for mid-course corrections, if any. For instance, RKVY can support a

range of activities but release of subsidy gets delayed. There is a need to build efficiencies

in the processes to achieve desired outcomes.

• Given the nature of these schemes, at least 2 concurrent independent social cost-benefit

analysis (mid-term, end-term) needs to be mandated. This apart from quantifying the

impact at the grass-root level would also be input provider for future policies.

• There is need to review the extent/ duration of incentives provided under the schemes

in-line with their life cycle. For instance, in case of PMKSY-PDMC, the micro irrigation

systems distributed under the scheme do not last for full 10 years. This results in the

situation where the beneficiaries have to either wait for a few more years before they

become eligible for another round of subsidy or give up on using micro irrigation

altogether. Therefore, the periodicity of subsidy needs to be aligned to the life of micro

irrigation system for continued and maximized impact.

• There is significant variations in scheme performances across different states. There is a

need for more distributed performance across states and accordingly more intense

engagement with the lagging states should be taken up. In some schemes such as RKVY,

more sustained efforts should be focused on engaging with the state departments to

expedite the implementation of the schemes.

• For majority of schemes, no information on women or SC/ST beneficiaries has been

provided by the department/ other stakeholders. Such data is also not available in

secondary sources for these schemes. Hence, it is important to capture this information

scheme wise to assess their performance on metrics of gender mainstreaming and

inclusion of socially disadvantaged groups.

• Moreover, component wise segregated information on gender of beneficiaries in not

available with the department for many of the schemes. Considering the importance of

the issue, such data/ information should be captured regularly and can be made a part of

the output/ outcome indicators.

• The data on employment generated as a result of the implementation of schemes is not

being maintained by the departments for most of the schemes. For measuring the actual

impacts of the schemes, it should be included as part of the outcome indicators.

Furthermore, most schemes do not have provision for convergence and there is limited

evidence of initiatives for convergence of activities with other schemes such as MUDRA

which can help in improving effectiveness of the efforts.

**Fund flow efficiency and utilisation**

• The Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) are funded with contributions from both centre

and the state governments. It has been observed that the many states’ contribution is

typically delayed which affects the implementation. Further, the approval mechanism

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

also delays any mid-course corrections/ proposal revisions significantly. As a result, this

affects the implementation and thereby the effectiveness of the schemes significantly.

Submission of utilisation certificates by the states also takes considerable time. The whole

process of approval of proposals, release and subsequent transfer of funds, revision of

proposals and utilization reporting, etc. need to be streamlined to reduce delays.

• In almost all the major schemes, there are significant differences among states in terms of

scheme progress and utilization. There is a need for more distributed performance across

states and accordingly more intense engagement with the lagging states should be taken

up, particularly with states having better Agricultural Marketing and Farmer Friendly

Reforms Index (AMFFRI) ranking.

• Efficiency in terms of fund utilization and disbursement at the central government level

is satisfactory in most of the schemes.

• For better efficiency, schemes should have annual revisit of cost norms to account for

inflation and other cost escalations. For instance, under MIDH, some of the costs norms

under scheme needs to be revised in line with the cost escalation for various components

with time. Similarly, in case of RAD, many important activities related to soil moisture

conservation and water harvesting have been undertaken in a limited way under the

scheme due to limited funding and lower cost norms. Efforts are being made to take up

such activities through PMKSY-PDMC. The funding for these components should also be

increased under the scheme.

• In all relevant schemes, there are specific budget allocations for SC/ ST beneficiaries and

components (as Sub-Plans). However, information on the utilization of the sub-plan funds

were not provided for most schemes.

• Special packages for certain states and NER can be introduced with higher subsidy

percentages and more intensive awareness generation. For instance, the percentage

contribution of subsidy for setting up of a unit is substantially low when compared to

some of the other schemes such as Cold Chain Scheme of Ministry of Food Processing

Industries (MOFPI), GoI. The Cold Chain Scheme provides incentive of up to 50% for

general areas and 75% for NER and Himalayan States.

**Capacity Building**

• All schemes should have components of soft-interventions especially capacity building of

the stakeholders at the grass-root level (both implementing agencies and beneficiaries).

For instance, under PMKSY-PDMC, micro-irrigation support activities need to be

complemented with capacity building through training of beneficiaries on the operation

and maintenance of micro irrigation systems.

• It was observed that there is low awareness about components and trainings in some of

the schemes such as MIDH, RAD, RKVY, SMAM, SMAF, etc. Therefore, regular awareness

campaigns is important for achievement of targeted output-outcome indicators under the

scheme.

• During interactions with the department, it was highlighted that there is low awareness

at field level about output-outcome indicators. Thus, there is a need for sensitization and

including involvement of officials at various levels during the development of output-

outcome indicators. This would help in better reporting and impact measurement.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Lack of adequate infrastructure and skilled manpower are key barriers to efficient quality

assaying. For instance, in case of ISAM, mandis have limited capacity and can only handle

quality assaying of 6% - 15% of total arrivals during the peak season. Automation of

quality assaying labs can help reduce the process time, help save significantly on

resources and will increase transparency.

• Establishment of supporting infrastructure such as automated labs for quality assaying,

etc. are needed and may be undertaken in partnership with private players. Fiscal

incentives in form of subsidy, tax rebates, rental discount, space availability etc. may be

provided under the scheme to encourage participation of the private players.

• There is need to focus on demonstrations and training of farmers across all scheme

components for encouraging adoption of new technologies, For instance, in case of NFSM,

the farmers have implemented new technologies on their farms, including high-yielding

variety seeds/ hybrid seeds, drip irrigation, inter-cropping, and used bio-pesticides and

bio-fertilizers under mission's interventions. These activities need to be expanded for

sustainability.

• Development of marketing infrastructure needs to be supplemented with strengthening

of price discovery mechanisms, improved access to market information, linkages with e-

trading platforms, capacity building of the beneficiaries including farmers collectives and

other value chain actors on the aspects of quality standards and certifications, innovative

packaging & labelling techniques, branding support etc. particularly for organic labelling

and product exports. The same is required for interventions across the schemes such as

RKVY, ISAM, PKVY, etc. for sustainability.

• Dearth of qualified technical staff at grass-root level for implementation and management

of Scheme interventions is a key challenge. Thus, the state budgeting should also

incorporate an aspect for skill development and capacity building of project management

staff. Focus should be given on appointment/ recruitment of adequate resources at the

ground level along with required training of such resources. Periodical refresher training

courses should be organized for improvement of the knowledge of the field staff. Setting

up of project management units comprising subject matter expert/ technical resource at

the state and district level may also be considered.

• Overall, while the schemes have certain activities related to marketing support, they

majorly focus on increasing production and productivity and there is a gap when it comes

to market intervention initiatives. Agricultural marketing plays an important role not only

in stimulating production and consumption but in accelerating the pace of economic

development. The traditional market intervention tools like price support, price

signalling, etc. may be complemented and strengthened through selective use of

innovative market approaches like futures markets.

• e-NAM can play a significant role in building transparent markets & pricing systems.

Thereby, help the farmer to negotiate the contracts better and also improve access to

finance by enabling more robust business planning and thus better appreciation of

market risks by lender. Therefore, the implementation of this activity should to be taken

up on priority for greater impact.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

• Provision to add newer technologies in the sector with the help of research organizations

and start-ups can bring higher value to the sector. Such interventions may actively be

promoted under various schemes.

• The training and capacity building component under the schemes do not have any

modules on gender sensitization, which should be included.

• To scale up adoption of organic farming in the country, in addition to sensitization and

promotion of practices, it is important to develop innovative and scalable solutions with

respect to infrastructure, processing, marketing, etc. through dedicated research and

development in the field. It is suggested to allocate a certain proportion of funds for

action-oriented R&D specific to the agro-climatic conditions for promotion and wider

implementation of organic farming.

• It is suggested that the schemes may include provisions for promotion of climate friendly/

renewable energy facilities, climate friendly refrigerants for the cold chains, promoting

methane reduction emissions through feeding balanced ration, awareness generation, etc.

The schemes can also promote sustainable and climate friendly waste management

infrastructure. Along with such provision they may also include risk mitigation strategies

for potential adverse environmental impact. Moreover, there can be training

programmes on climate awareness/ mitigation/ adaptation measures for the farmers or

producers across the schemes.

**Convergence with other schemes**

• A well-defined exit strategy needs to be incorporated as part of the scheme’s

implementation strategy plan with a complementing budget. For instance, under RKVY,

development of direct marketing linkages between farmers/ farmer groups and the

private sector (processing player/ organized retail/ e-commerce etc) is critical and must

be emphasised upon. Further, convergences with other central/ state schemes should

also be considered for better implementation and cost-effectiveness. For example, the

strengthening of production clusters under the RKVY scheme may be linked with forward

infrastructure support facilitated under the PPPIAD or other schemes such as the scheme

for creation of backward and forward linkage/ Cold Chain/ Agro-Clusters/ Mega Food

Park etc.

• The integration of micro irrigation with the new schemes under Ministry of Renewable

Energy framed offer financial and water security to farmers would be beneficial to the

agriculture sector in realising higher productivity though sustainable mechanisms. The

upcoming solar irrigation scheme promotes installation of grid-connected solar power

plants and solar pumps with a target to add 25,750 MW of combined solar capacities (all

three components) by the year 2022.

• Many of the schemes have overlapping components and activities with other CSS and

schemes such as Cold Chain Scheme, Creation of Backward Forward Linkage Scheme of

MOFPI, White Revolution, etc. which also offer incentives to agriculture. Similarly, there

is a potential of convergence with other large national level programmes such as National

Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) and leverage their existing database of SHGs, details of

which are available up to the village level in most of the districts and blocks. Such database

can actually be leveraged for identification of potential beneficiaries and also plan the

logistics for outreach.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

A mapping of issues and challenges faced across the schemes with suggested recommendations

has been summarized below.

Table 130 : Mapping of Issues and Challenges with Recommendations at Umbrella Scheme Level

**\# Issues and Challenges Recommendations and Solutions**

**Governance and Implementation Mechanism**

A. 1 Major schemes such as ISAC, RAD,

MIDH, NMAET, PMKSY-PDMC, SHM,

etc. are having limited funding against

targeted outputs. Significant difference

between approved outlay and the

actual funds allocated to the schemes

have also been observed.

Funding requirement of the schemes needs to be

evaluated against the targeted outputs and priority/

potential of interventions.

A. 2 The focus of most of the schemes is on

improving production and

productivity. However, the critical

problems that are being faced by

farmers are increasing cost of

cultivation as well as wide gap

between consumer and farm gate

prices resulting in low price

realization.

It has been observed that farmers despite having a

good production are not able to make profits due to

low price realization and increased cost of production.

Therefore, there is need to bring focus on cost

optimization and better price realization for farmers

in scheme interventions. This will help in increasing

profitability and income for farmers.

A. 3 Many schemes have multiple

components, but the progress is

reported on the select few. For

instance, PMKSY-PDMC is primarily

showing good progress in micro-

irrigation but very low achievements

in SWMA. Similarly, MIDH is showing

progress in area coverage but slow

progress on many other components

such as adoption of GAP, etc.

The projects submitted under the schemes must be

reviewed and the states must be directed to focus on

all relevant components.

The schemes may also be reviewed to remove

activities or component wherein there is limited

progress.

There is a need to restructure/ merge certain schemes

and/ or activities therein for convergence, better

implementation and avoiding duplication. For

example, MIDH and SMAM have common components

of farm mechanization. Similarly, RKVY allows

different types of economic activities which may have

overlap with many other schemes.

The opportunities for rationalization and convergence

of schemes have been detailed in later sections of the

report.

A. 4 In the e-NAM scheme, traders and

buyers have a lack of trust in the

online system since they often observe

mismatch between traditional and

automated processes.

Trust on e-NAM can only be generated through

awareness building and business process re-

engineering of the processes can be carried out to

improve its performance and utility.

In addition, logistic support can also be provided to

farmers/ traders through e-NAM for better facilitation.

A. 5 The lack of quality testing, grading and

assaying labs in markets for quality

testing of produce impacts price

determination. There is limited village

level infrastructure for aggregation,

storage and transportation of produce.

Infrastructure gap assessment can be carried out in

state markets and market committees reporting high

volume of trade can be prioritized for support. Mandi

infrastructure also need to be adequately established/

upgraded such as proper entry gates, adequate

number of live work stations, weighing bridges

connected to eNAM and trained resources at gates so

that the long queuing, particularly, during the peak

season may be avoided.

The scheme interventions on increasing price

realisation to farmers needs to be supported by stable

trade regime and a more farmer oriented policy shift.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**\# Issues and Challenges Recommendations and Solutions**

A. 6 The activities taken up by the

cooperatives are fairly limited as most

of the activities are related to credit

and fertiliser distribution. The

relevant scheme’s guidelines also limit

the activities that can be supported

under the project.

ISAC may be appropriately revised to focus on the

weak areas. Consultation with stakeholders can be

taken up to prioritize the scope of activities. Guidelines

can then be revised and modified to diversify the scope

of approved activities. Few important areas where the

scheme may focus are as below.

• Providing support for processing and marketing of

produce for better price realization.

• Strengthening of forward linkages for selling of

produce.

• Capacity building should be given high priority.

A. 7 Significant variations are present in

terms of implementation structure,

processes, guideline formats and

documents across schemes.

Standardization of implementation plan and processes

across schemes needs to be undertaken to reduce

ambiguity within the implementing agencies.

A. 8 Need for revision in cost norms has

been observed for few schemes such

as RAD, ISAC, etc.

The cost norms and guidelines of the schemes need to

be updated on a periodic basis.

A. 9 There is variation across states in

taxes and surcharges levied in mandis

on sale/procurement of produce.

The mandi taxes across states needs to be made

uniform, there is need for a uniform law across India

for transaction of agricultural commodities.

A. 10 The infrastructure development

activities in states are marred by slow

tendering process and time lag in

availing necessary approvals and

clearances.

The tendering process in the states needs to be

reviewed, the processes of getting various approvals

and licenses for infrastructure development activities

can be fast tracked by using state level single window

portals.

A. 11 There are limited incentives for the

private sector engagement in key

schemes.

Incentives can be provided to get private sector

involved in schemes such as Participatory Integrated

Micro-Irrigation Management at a scalable level

which needs to be encouraged by offering higher

incentives and greater flexibility to private players.

A. 12 Quality and cost of equipment

provided through schemes has been

expressed as an area of concern.

It needs to be ensured that only good quality tested

equipment from certified vendors is being provided.

Schemes like SMAM have an elaborate structure of

equipment testing, it has also identified vendors

across India for supply of equipment. This can be

adopted across schemes to ensure that the quality of

equipment is not compromised.

A. 13 Incomplete implementation has been

reported in Direct Benefit transfer

(DBT) under schemes.

Complete implementation of Direct Benefit Transfer

by all states is required to ensure full transparency in

the fund transfers under the back-ended capital

subsidy schemes. A quarterly review on the progress

may be initiated to engage more with states.

A. 14 Poor adoption of micro-irrigation^357 :

Many factors such as localised farming,

complexity of designs, fragmented

landholding, low awareness and lack of

access to credit, lead to poor adoption

of micro-irrigation among farmers.

In-spite of the well-known benefits of modern

irrigation methods such as surface or sub-surface drip

and sprinkler irrigation systems, they are not widely

adopted on large scale by farmers because of high

capital cost, non-reliable sources of water for the

system, marginal and scattered agricultural

landholdings, unavailability of subsidy at the required

time or the delayed release of funds for installation of

micro irrigation system that have already been

approved. Therefore, it is important to simplify and

provide easy financing mechanisms for farmers.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**\# Issues and Challenges Recommendations and Solutions**

A. 15 Schemes have become target oriented,

resulting in achievement of targets but

low adoption. Missions and schemes

like NMAET, PMKSY-PDMC and SHM

are able to show good progress in

achieving targeted outputs but have

not resulted in corresponding

adoption.

Extension services need to be strengthened in

promotion of schemes and focus should be more on

field demonstrations. The coverage of micro-irrigation

components needs to be extended to all states, while

there needs to be focus on field demonstrations and

maintaining quality of recommendations under SHM

to succeed.

A. 16 Seasonal activities are getting affected

by delay in release of funds.

100% central assistance and direct transfer to

implementing agencies can be considered for critical

seasonal activities.

A. 17 Umbrella scheme contains NMSA

which is targeting diversification, soil

health and input use efficiency,

however, more efforts are needed to

create awareness among farmers,

promotion of good agriculture

activities, development of climate

friendly infrastructure, etc.

The infrastructure developed under the scheme

should promote energy efficient technology and

climate friendly equipment. Trainings on roles and

impact of climate change, pest and disease

management, input use efficiency, crop diversification

and soil health needs to provided. More focus should

be on managing risks in agriculture for climate

resilient farming. As highlighted earlier, the trainings

can be demonstration oriented.

A. 18 The schemes largely do not have

components to encourage gender

sensitivity.

Training, capacity building and awareness building

activities can be initiated to promote women farmers

and encourage them in promoting and managing

activities of FPOs/FIGs/Societies in villages.

A. 19 Limited information is available in the

public domain for some of the

schemes.

Latest guidelines and cost norms for all the schemes

should be updated on the public domain. The changes

in the guidelines and/ or approval process must also

be immediately updated on the department's website

as and when the changes are made, in order to spread

timely awareness about the schemes and their

benefits.

A. 20 Following issues identified in

horticultural value chain needs to be

considered in planning and

implementation of the scheme^358

• Lack of quality inputs

• Lack of cold storage and logistics

for perishable crops in key

production clusters

• Unscientific fertiliser application

• Fragmented and unorganised

infrastructure for pre cooling,

pack-houses, mobile-pre cooling,

cold storage do not have the

desired impacts.

• General lack of awareness among

farmers regarding the

micronutrient deficiency and its

impact on production and soil

health.

• Persistent spread of rootstock

diseases in key production

clusters.

The gaps identified are critical and need to be assessed

for ensuring achievement of the envisaged outcome of

the MIDH scheme. An independent assessment of the

schemes to assess these areas needs to be carried out

and value chain studies of commodities needs to be

conducted to identify critical interventions for each

commodity. Critical areas of interventions such lack of

planting material, disease control, unavailability of

inputs, inadequate integrated post-harvest

infrastructure for storage, processing, grading and

logistics of perishable commodities, needs to be

addressed through review of scheme and establishing

convergence with other schemes.

• Integrated post-harvest management right from

aggregation of produce at farm level, pack

houses, cold storage to refrigerated

transportation facilities should be encouraged in

major production clusters.

• Surplus production in certain areas impact the

price realisation of farmers and impact overall

profit, especially when the major income of

farmers are dependent on a single crop.

Diversification with intercropping along with

**\# Issues and Challenges Recommendations and Solutions**

• Lack of awareness about good

farming.

• Low price realisation to farmers

due to surplus production in key

production clusters

• Lack of good harvesting practices

and post-harvest management of

important crops like mango and

guava.

• Increasing cost of inputs

• Lack of market intelligence

among producers also affect

profitability

• Insufficient staff at block and

district level for supply of

planting material, training and

demonstration.

crop rotation should be promoted as risk

mitigation strategy.

• In addition, micro-irrigation can be promoted in

horticulture clusters and soil health card testing

facilities can be established through other

schemes such as SHM.

• In case of post-harvest management, small scale

projects can be taken up by state governments

whereas the larger projects can be directly

implemented by the department at the ministry

level.

• Schemes like SMAE and ISAM can focus on

extension, awareness and development of

marketing infrastructure in horticulture clusters.

• Within the scheme FPOs/ FIGs have been formed

in only few states such as Chhattisgarh, Haryana,

Karnataka and Odisha. Few states such as

Gujarat, West Bengal, Telangana and Kerala have

been allocated fund but have not formed any

groups. Formation of FPOs and FIGs needs to be

strengthened.

A. 21 The current set of schemes have

limited engagement with FPOs.

Promotion of FPOs and their tie up with Market

Aggregators (MAs) and Financial Institutions (FIs)

should become part of the scheme’s strategy.

A. 22 Lack of coordination between

department and state level

implementing agencies has been

observed in across few schemes.

Coordination must be established between

implementing agencies at state level and state level

mission or teams must be formed wherever absent.

There can be adequate provisions for administrative

expenses and awareness generation if the project is

being implemented by external agencies like NABARD,

NCDC and active engagement is needed to ensure their

participation and accountability.

A. 23 Limited staff strength at state level is a

major challenge in scheme

implementation and awareness

generation, e.g. agriculture engineers

in SMAM, agriculture supervisors in

NFSM, block and district level staff in

MIDH, etc.

The state departments and central teams may be

encouraged to recruit qualified technical human

resources for effective implementation.

A. 24 Delay is observed in processing of loan

applications and processing of subsidy

for entrepreneurship driven schemes.

Timeline and process flows need to be developed for

processing and disbursal of loans and applications.

Steps can be taken up for online automatic transfer of

subsidy.

A. 25 Conservation and maintenance of

water resources in key production

clusters is missing.

Conservation and maintenance of water resources in

key horticulture clusters can be promoted through

scheme and convergence with other schemes.

A. 26 There is much variation in progress of

different states. Moreover, there are

variations in progress in different

activities covered under major

schemes.

There is a need for more distributed performance

across states and accordingly more intense

engagement with the lagging states should be taken

up. The variations in progress in different activities

covered under the scheme should be addressed

through involving multi-disciplinary team at central

and state level for project planning and approvals.

A. 27 Farmers are not finding it profitable to

shift to organic farming due to reduced

productivity in initial years and lack of

price premium for produce. Also the

Value addition and marketing are two of the

components which are essential for adoption of

organic farming among farmers. There is need to focus

on development of these components for better price

process of getting certification is

lengthy, costly and complex.

realization to farmers along with promotion of

production in the region. It should be followed by the

development of supporting infrastructure for

reduction in wastages of organic produce. In addition,

following steps can be taken up.

• The farmers may be provided financial support

for one or two crops to cover the losses in

productivity due to organic cultivation.

• Standards have to be developed for organic

fertilizers and inputs to check their quality, since

quality of inputs is critical for maintaining farm

productivity.

• The process of organic certification needs to be

streamlined and measures are needed to ensure

that the farmer gets premium price for the

certified produce.

A. 28 There is limited focus on product

traceability.

Traceability along seed value chain helps to protect

the income loss incurred by farmers due to use of

spurious and low quality seeds. Thus, scheme

interventions should facilitate development of

technology based solutions for building seed

traceability mechanism/ systems. Private sector

partnerships may be encouraged for the same.

A. 29 Complex guidelines leading to delay in

approval, revision of proposal and

release of funds.

Guidelines of schemes needs to be revised and made

more flexible, timelines for various processes must

also be defined and needs to be adhered to.

A. 30 MIS for tracking scheme progress is

available for only some of the schemes.

A centralized MIS system needs to be established to

track and monitor schemes progress.

A. 31 Absence of multi-disciplinary technical

teams at central and state level. For

instance, there are no technical

resources at central level that can

update MIS system and help in geo-

tagging of assets/ farms supported

under RAD.

Requirement of staff at central and state level needs to

be assessed. Technical support groups involving multi-

disciplinary team needs to be created for project

management, planning and implementation. Fixed

term contracts for 3-4 years with yearly performance

linked appraisal may be introduced.

A. 32 Use of old guidelines and cost norms

affecting scheme performance and

fund utilization.

The guidelines and cost norms for the schemes need to

be revised periodically.

A. 33 Schemes and interventions are planned

in isolation.

A technical support group must be established at

department level. The group should consist of a multi-

disciplinary team. This team can assess the sectoral

requirements, plan and develop schemes and their

components to ensure convergences across schemes.

A. 34 Limited progress has been observed for

implementation of SC/ST components

as well as on achieving 30% women

beneficiary targets.

The bottlenecks in achieving targets for women and

SC/ST beneficiaries must be reviewed in-consultation

with states. Capacity building exercises on gender

sensitisation can also be promoted. State specific

survey and exercises can be carried out to identify

activities which can be targeted for SC/ST and women

beneficiaries.

A. 35 There are limited/ no interventions

across schemes for landless farmers.

Landless farmers can be supported through

interventions like bee keeping and animal husbandry.

Provisions for farmers who take land on lease can also

be introduced in the schemes.

A. 36 Limited scope for private sector

engagement present across schemes.

There is need to engage with private sector for

development of agriculture sector and their

participation in agriculture marketing should be

supported by the states by encouraging them to  
engage in contract farming models, allowing direct  
marketing, rationalization of market fee, and  
attracting agencies to take up development of market  
infrastructure.  
**Fund Flow Utilization and Efficiency**  
B. 1 Components where state’s share is  
required, funds are transferred to state  
treasury, the state treasury also take  
time to approve the same and in case  
the state had already finalised its  
budget components before receiving  
the funding from centre, the release of  
funds (state’s share) are delayed up to  
RE stage. Such delay severely affects  
seasonal activities e.g. plantation,  
agroforestry, seed production, etc.

The process of routing the funds to state treasury may

be avoided for some important components where

progress has been slow or where states are reluctant

to transfer there share.

Timelines for processing and approval of proposals as

well as transfer of funds needs to be defined and

adhered to

B. 2 Delay in funding and slow nature of

infrastructure activities has affected

schemes progress. The funds are

released by the department after

receiving satisfactory progress reports,

proper utilization certificates and

audited expenditure statements

against the fund released.

Nature of activities needs to be considered while

evaluating performance and utilisation, the

infrastructure based projects can be assessed on

completion of milestones in each year and UCs may

be asked on the basis of completion of milestones.

B. 3 There is significant variation between

performances of states. Many have not

reported status of activities. Delay in

processing of utilisation certificates

from state level affect monitoring and

reporting of achievement.

Active engagement is required with non-performing

states, the reasons for delayed submission of UCs

must be discussed with states. For infrastructure

related components UCs may be asked on the basis of

completion of milestones.

It has been observed that some agencies are not able

to provide utilization certificates on-time despite

reporting progress on activities due to lack of

coordination at state level. Such cases must be

highlighted separately and must be dealt on case to

case basis.

B. 4 It has been observed in many schemes

that while there has been good

financial achievement, the physical

achievement is low.

The cost guidelines needs be revised and the physical

targets also may need to be aligned with the level of

funds received.

B. 5 Components that have received 100%

funding from centre have shown

better financial utilisation than other

important activities such as nursery

development and production of

quality planting material where state’s

contribution is included.

Certain important components which are important

for development of the sector may be funded 100% by

centre for better overall development and addressing

of sectoral needs.

**Monitoring and Evaluation**  
C. 1 Mismatch has been observed between  
the output and outcome indicators with  
scheme objectives for many schemes.

The output and outcome indicators need to be

revisited and aligned with the scheme interventions

and objectives after consultation with the department

representatives and officers dealing with the

respective schemes.

C. 2 Partial information is available on

outputs of the scheme and limited or no

information is available on the

outcomes.

An MIS needs to be developed wherein information on

progress of outputs and outcomes should be updated

on a periodic basis.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**\# Issues and Challenges Recommendations and Solutions**

C. 3 Targets for outputs and outcomes are

not aligned with the funds received.

Output of the schemes needs to be revised on the basis

of proposals sanctioned and the funds received for the

year. Outcomes can then be appropriately revised on

the basis of the revised outputs.

C. 4 For subsidy driven schemes there is no

mechanism to monitor branch-wise

performance

There is a need for mechanism to monitor branch-wise

performance real time to identify the bottlenecks and

improve the efficiency of the scheme. To monitor

branch-wise performance, provisions can be made in

ENSURE portal so the central team can see the

information of the bank branches which have

submitted and processed the application. The central

team can track the progress of application through

ENSURE portal.

C. 5 Periodic evaluations are not available

for major schemes such as PMKSY-

PDMC, ISAM, etc.

Periodic evaluations need to be in-built in the

implementation strategy of the schemes including

flexibility for mid-course corrections, if any.

C. 6 Need for concurrent monitoring has

been highlighted in some of the

schemes.

Third party concurrent monitoring must be

introduced across schemes.

There is need to review the extent/ duration of

incentives provided under the schemes in-line with

their life cycle. For instance, in case of PMKSY-PDMC,

the micro irrigation systems distributed under the

scheme do not last for full 10 years. This results in the

situation where the beneficiaries have to either wait

for a few more years before they become eligible for

another round of subsidy or give up on using micro

irrigation altogether. Therefore, the periodicity of

subsidy needs to be aligned to the life of micro

irrigation system for continued and maximized

impact.

C. 7 The schemes are not tracking the

employment generated.

The employment generated or the number of person

days of work generated through scheme interventions

needs to be tracked and recorded across schemes.

C. 8 Evaluation studies for all schemes are

not available on public domain.

All important documents related to schemes including

evaluation studies, baseline, cost guidelines, operation

guidelines, state-wise progress must be made

available on public domain.

C. 9 Social audits have been conducted

sparingly across schemes.

Social audits of scheme interventions can be carried

out as part of concurrent monitoring process. This can

be made mandatory for infrastructure components.

C. 10 State level teams have not been formed

in many states.

Wherever needed state level committees have to be

formed. The formation of state level committees is

important for convergence and coordination.

C. 11 Geo-tagging of infrastructure and

activities is partially covered

Geo-tagging of infrastructure, structure created must

be made mandatory. The geo-tagged infrastructure

can be linked to the MIS dashboard

C. 12 Many schemes do not provide

information on women or SC/ ST.

This information needs to be provided in public

domain for all schemes. MIS should be developed in a

way that it captures such information.

C. 13 Scheme interventions does not

adequately focus on maintenance of

structures.

The development of physical infrastructure under

various schemes needs to be supported with

components on maintenance and upkeep of these

structures. For example, in case of PMKSY, even

though the scheme had a component focussing on

repair, restoration and renovation of existing

structures, these were not focussed on during

implementation. As a result, water bodies/ structures

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**\# Issues and Challenges Recommendations and Solutions**

covering only 6066.74 hectares i.e. less than 2% of  
SWMA interventions and less than 0.5% of overall  
interventions, have been renovated during last 5  
years.  
**Capacity Building**

D. 1 Very few trainings and awareness

generation activities have been

conducted across schemes.

All schemes should have components of soft-

interventions especially capacity building of the

stakeholders at the grass-root level (both

implementing agencies and beneficiaries). It was

observed that there is low awareness about

components and trainings in some of the schemes such

as MIDH, RAD, RKVY, SMAM, SMAF, etc. Therefore,

regular awareness campaigns are important for

achievement of targets under the scheme.

D. 2 Lack of adequate infrastructure and

skilled manpower are key barriers to

efficient quality assaying.

Certified and trained staff should be recruited at least

across major markets in India. This will help in more

efficient trading, transparency and enhancing

activities on online trading platforms.

D. 3 The primary and secondary analysis

revealed the dearth of qualified

technical staff and project

management professionals is a key

challenge at ground level.

Availability of project management staff can help in

better planning, development of quality proposals,

monitoring and documentation. A comprehensive

training needs assessment must be carried out to

assess training needs of the staff.

D. 4 Limited focus is there on marketing of

produce.

Activities such as enhancement of procurement and

processing infrastructure needs to be supplemented

by marketing of produce for ensuring better price

realization for producers.

D. 5 Limited focus on building awareness

about climate change.

Separate component needs to be included under the

schemes on creating awareness about climate change

and sustainability or disaster risk reduction related to

their operations.

It is suggested that the schemes may include

provisions for promotion of climate friendly/

renewable energy facilities, climate friendly

refrigerants for the cold chains, awareness generation,

etc.

The schemes can also promote sustainable and climate

friendly waste management infrastructure. Along with

such provision they may also include risk mitigation

strategies for potential adverse environmental impact.

Moreover, there can be training programmes on

climate awareness/ mitigation/ adaptation measures

for the farmers or producers across the schemes.

D. 6 Limited progress is achieved on

technology adoption, IPM, good

agricultural practices, etc.

Training programs, demonstration, online videos and

reading extension materials can be developed and

provided to farmers on these aspects. Clear and

specific recommendations on do’s and don’ts for each

crop can be developed. Video tutorials can be

developed for demonstrating seed treatment,

harvesting, grading and IPM.

D. 7 The report of the Committee on

Doubling Farmers Income^359

highlighted that capacity building of

extension functionaries was not

Training need assessment of the functionaries can be

carried out at three year intervals and the gaps can

then be addressed.

**\# Issues and Challenges Recommendations and Solutions**

sustained, leading to achievement of

less-than-potential outcomes. This,

combined with attrition-ridden and

unstable contractual manpower has

been responsible for non-achievement

of targets.

Focus should be given on appointment/ recruitment of

adequate resources at the ground level along with

required training of such resources.

Periodical refresher training courses should be

organized for improvement of the knowledge of the

field staff. Setting up of project management units

comprising subject matter expert/ technical resource

at the state and district level may also be considered.

The public and private extension systems must

highlight on “what to do”, and also on educating on

“what not to do”. The farmers, thus, need to be

sensitized not only in new practices but also on the

need or ineffectiveness of ongoing habits to pre-empt

risks and failures.

D. 8 There is a requirement for more field

demonstration activities and melas to

encourage adoption among farmers.

Demonstration activity is critical to encourage

adoption of farm mechanization and improved

farming practices amongst farmers. There is a

requirement for more field demonstration activities

and melas along with increased budget for the same.

D. 9 No engagement with private sector

specifically for training and skill

development.

Active private sector engagement can be sought with  
agri-tech enterprises for extension and support. Use of  
technology in extension can be encouraged. Firms  
providing package of services including, input,  
equipment, technical, extension and marketing can be  
engaged in key production clusters.  
**Convergence**  
E. 1 Many schemes and components that  
are interrelated are planned in  
isolation.

There is a need to integrate important components.

Multi-disciplinary team at department level can be

formed to initiate this process at central level.

E. 2 Mechanisation and post-harvest

management component spread across

schemes leading to overlaps and

inefficiency.

Mechanisation efforts needs to be supplemented by

better marketing of produce. Hence, convergence with

agri-marketing schemes is critical for success of the

farm mechanization.

The equipment tested and certified under the scheme

along with the established cost norms can act as ready

reference for other schemes that are providing

subsidized machinery/ equipment.

There is a potential of convergence between schemes

such as SMAM, MIDH, NFSM, RKVY, etc. where farm

mechanization component is covered.

E. 3 Limited partnerships with private

players.

Convergence with other scheme/ programme/

initiatives of centre and state government,

developmental organizations and private sector

should be encouraged for creating backward and

forward linkage and development of an integrated

value chain.

Tie-ups can be established with international

initiatives and NGOs such as World Food Program,

FAO and Precision Agricultural Development, Tata-

Cornell, PRADAN, AKRSP for research, collaboration

and input delivery for productivity improvement.

These collaboration will help in better marketing and

achieving higher volume of production.

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

**Change in Key Indicators for the Sector**

As highlighted in the sectoral analysis, agriculture sector faces a range of challenges viz.

increasing production cost, depleting ground water resources, temporal availability of water,

declining soil quality, scarcity of quality agriculture inputs^360 , low productivity, reducing crop

diversity, climate change, increasing land degradation and most importantly low price realisation

for farmers^361. The interventions under the Umbrella Scheme of Green Revolution and PMKSY

aim to help in overcoming these challenges.

The current set of schemes are targeting increased water use efficiency, availability of quality

inputs including seeds and planting materials, soil water management activities, soil health card,

agriculture extension, field demonstration, promotion of organic farming and creation of

marketing infrastructure. Promotion of crop diversification through integrated farming,

integrated pest management, production of quality planting material, repair and renovation of

water bodies and reclamation of soil are some of the other important interventions that are part

of the key schemes but need further attention.

Some of the key challenges observed in implementation of the schemes were limited availability

of funds for achievement of targeted outputs, low awareness levels among beneficiaries, limited

infrastructure for marketing and storage in mandis, delay in processing of subsidy to farmers,

lack of trained manpower for extension and soil testing, differences in allocation and release of

funds, interstate variation in performance and poor adoption of recommendations by farmers.

Isolated interventions such as increasing capacity of storage without access to equivalent

handling capacity in marketing and tendency to create infrastructure with only purpose of

deferring sale have been highlighted as the key bottlenecks in wider market reach. Lack of

integration in existing marketing infrastructure from aggregation, assaying, transportation,

storage and distribution and lack of differentiated approach in infrastructure development with

mere focus on only storage of excess produce were highlighted as key bottleneck in appropriate

price realisation for farmers^362.

The scheme interventions on increasing price realisation to farmers needs to be supported by

stable trade regime and a more farmer oriented policy shift^363. A need to liberalize stock limits

and control regulations has also been highlighted in multiple reports^364 to promote agribusiness

and exports of key agricultural commodities. The pattern of change in some critical focus areas

for which information is available is provided below^365.

As can be seen from above that the trends show positive development across most of the selected

parameters. The production of cereals, pulses, oilseeds and horticultural crops have increased

over the period. The cropping intensity also improved in comparison to 2004-05. The production

Husbandry and Fisheries Sector

of foundation seeds and certified seeds have increased significantly during this period which has

contributed in improved productivity for oilseeds, pulses, cereals and horticultural crops. This

shows the impact of interventions for productivity improvement under various schemes. The

improved production and productivity has resulted in improvement in per capital availability for

all crop categories. This is very important step towards achieving food security in India.

Various studies have highlighted the intensive use of nitrogen fertiliser in India as deteriorating

factor for soil health. It appears that the series of measures like promotion of soil health card and

good agricultural activities have had some impact as the overall use of N-fertiliser declined

despite the increase in production and productivity. The use of phosphorus also reduced during

the period, however, an increase in consumption of potassium was reported, which indicates a

slightly balanced ratio of fertilisers.

The results of interventions for farm mechanisation can be noticed by the increase in farm power

availability per hectare. In addition, the storage capacity has also increased by more than 15% in

this duration which indicates the impact of infrastructural development measures taken up by

the Government in recent years.

It was noted that while many schemes have huge basket of interventions which are important in

terms of achievement of the key outcomes, however, achievement and focus is observed on a few

selected components in many schemes. For instance, in case of RAD the primary focus and

majority of achievements were limited to integrated farming or agroforestry based interventions.

While many other important interventions such as reclamation of problem soils, in-situ moisture

conservation, gully control, vermi-bed, value added resource conservation systems and

greenhouse structures were covered sparingly. In some cases, progress in physical and financial

achievement has also not resulted in achieving key mission objective e.g. satisfactory physical

progress in NMAET has not resulted in appropriate level of technology adoption.

Within various schemes there appears to be greater focus on achieving physical progress in

numbers, while lower focus is on assessing impact of such interventions. For instance, under Soil

Health Management, targets of conducting soil testing and distributing soil health card have been

met, however, the utility and effectiveness of the soil health card and relevance of the

recommendations made also needs to be explored. It is also needs to be assessed whether or not

the recommendations have yielded any benefits to the farmers. In view of the above, there is

scope of further rationalization for better and focused implementation of sectoral interventions.

The rationalization of schemes has been provided in the following section of the report.

The scheme is highly relevant for promoting water

conservation and improving on-farm water use

efficiency. The focus needs to be provided on

implementation across the states and activities related

to SWMA need to be undertaken on priority.

NA Water is one of the most important resources in

agriculture. As per Central Water Commission, 85.3%

of the total water consumed in India was for agriculture

in 2000 and is likely to reduce to 83.3% by 2025. India

is currently a water deficient nation with estimated per

capita availability of 1400 cubic meter in 2018.

PMKSY’s main objective is to achieve convergence of

investment in irrigation for improving on-farm water

use efficiency and it focuses on enhancing water use

efficiency at farm level through micro irrigation.

Besides promoting precision irrigation and better on-

farm water management practices to optimize the use

of available water resources, this component also

(i) – Merger – Due to common objectives

Considering the much higher budget allocation of ISAM

and to avoid overlap/ duplication of activities, it is

desirable to merge ISAC with ISAM with an added

component of assisting NCDC.

ISAM The main objectives of the Integrated Scheme on

Agricultural Cooperation include:

*   To provide assistance to NCDC for financing the  
    activities of cooperatives like agro-processing,  
    marketing of food grains, input supply, development of  
    weaker section cooperatives, computerization of  
    cooperatives etc.
*   To develop cooperative awareness amongst the  
    people and to cater to the education and training  
    requirements of cooperative personnel and State  
    Government officials dealing with Co-operatives.

Both the above objectives (except NCDC as the agency

being assisted) are covered under the objectives/

activities of Integrated Scheme on Agricultural

(vii) Others: To be continued with minor changes under

NMSA as the Soil Health Management component.

The focus needs to be on creation of soil testing

infrastructure and assessing the effectiveness of

recommendations.

NA These schemes seem to be already subsumed under

NMSA as sub-components/ sub-missions.

NMSA aims to promote sustainable agriculture and

climate resilient farming through Climate change

adaptation. Its objective is to make agriculture more

productive, sustainable, remunerative, and climate

resilient by promoting location specific

integrated/composite farming systems; soil and

moisture conservation measures; comprehensive soil

health management; efficient water management

practices and mainstreaming rainfed technologies. The

following CSS schemes are sub-components/ Sub-

missions under NMSA:

*   Rainfed Area development (RAD)
*   Sub-mission on Agroforestry (SMAF)
*   Soil Health Management (SHM)
*   Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna (PKVY)
*   Organic Value Chain Development for North  
    East Region (MOVCD-NER)
*   National Bamboo Mission (NBM)

Out of the above sub-missions, MOVCD-NER can be

merged with PKVY as it has similar mechanism and

Sub - Mission

on Agriculture

Extension

(vii) Others: To be continued with major changes under

NMAET.

ATMA was envisioned to facilitate linking farmers to

market so as to ensure decent price realisation. Despite

this, most extension services are restricted to advisory

on production aspects, without catering to marketing

concerns. The extension functionaries need to be trained

and made accountable for the targeted outcomes. Also,

farmers need to be sensitized not only in new practices

but also on the need or ineffectiveness of ongoing habits

to pre-empt risks and failures. There is need to provide

higher focus on field demonstrations.

NA These schemes are now sub-missions of the National

Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology

(NMAET). The Scheme guidelines of NMAET mention

that the common threads running across all 4 Sub-

Missions are Extension & Technology. The scheme

aims to restructure & strengthen agricultural

extension to enable delivery of appropriate technology

and improved agronomic practices to the farmers.

This is envisaged to be achieved by:

• A mix of physical outreach & interactive methods

of information dissemination

• Use of ICT

• Popularization of modern and appropriate

technologies
