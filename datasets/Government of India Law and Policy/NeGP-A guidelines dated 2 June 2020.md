The Principal Secretaries/Director (Agriculture) of all States/UTs

  Subject: Revision of National e-Governance Plan in Agriculture (NeGP-A) implementation approach.

Madam/Sir,

I am directed to say the National e-Governance Plan in Agriculture (NeGPA) was initially launched in seven selected States namely, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, in the last quarter of 2010-11. NeGPA aims to achieve rapid development in India through use of Information & Communication Technology (ICT) for timely access to agriculture related information for the farmers. This Scheme was subsequently extended in 2nd Phase to cover all the remaining States and 2 UTs from 2014-15. Phase-II of the scheme which was to end on 31.03.2020 has been extended for one year upto 31.03.2021.

2.  Under NeGPA (Phase II), funds were released to States for carrying out the activities viz. Site preparation of offices, where hardware is to be installed and establishment of computer training labs, Procurement, installation and accounting of Hardware/system software. Back-up power arrangements, wherever required, Setting-up of State Project Management Unit (SPMUs) and hiring of manpower on contract basis (Data Entry Operators), Connectivity for the locations where hardware is being installed and Data Digitization Customization of applications as per State/ UT’s specific requirements.

3.  Under the scheme, funding pattern between the Centre and the State is 90:10 for North Eastern States & Himalayan States, 60:40 for other States and 100:0 for UTs.

4.  In the meanwhile, the Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income (DFI) in its report appreciated the role of Digital Technology, which can play a transformational role in modernizing and organizing how rural India performs its agricultural activities. The possible components for modern management of agriculture are i) Remote Sensing; ii) Geographical Information System; iii) Data Analytics; iv) Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning and v) Internet of Things. DFI Report, inter-alia, mention that :

I)  The remote sensing or drone based imagery can i) assist in crop classification,

ii) aid in more accurate crop production estimation to add transparency to the System

and speed up the crop insurance processes, iii) enhance the ability to detect and quantify physical and biological stresses that affect the productivity of agricultural crop, iv) monitor crop health, irrigation, pesticide management, planting etc.

II) Farms and Farmers produce big data, which can be consolidated and analytics/interpreted using information technology.

III) As a technology Internet of Things, can be used for networking of traditional devices like desktops, phones and tablets, to a wider range of everyday things like appliances, sensors, vending machines, automobiles, etc.

IV) Artificial Intelligence supports in decision making, provided through machine and digital learning processes. Farmers can benefit not only from the direct on-farm applications of AI, but also from its use in the development of improved seeds, crop protection, and fertility products. Besides the unpredictable biological and weather related processes during cultivation, agriculture is also dependent on variables from multiple market situations. In this complex situation, AI can offer more reliable predictions, to be used as a basis for planning and control of all agricultural activities.

V)  Block-chain technology can be used to record interlinked field practices such as INM/IPM (Integrated Nutrient Management / Integrated Pest Management), confirm good agricultural practices, validate resource use efficiencies, build traceability for the produce from farm to fork, prevent price extortion and delayed payments.

VI) Agricultural sector remains labour intensive and is a source of employment to a large section of societies across the world, Robots and Sensors can be used is areas where intensive attention or precision is required or where labour is not able to perform as per high-tech requirements. Robotics also help in automation of some tasks and can also free the individual farmer to prioritise and take on other works for added gains. Not to forget, this altered system would contribute to offering the mass labour well-deserved human dignity.

5.  In the above background, NeGPA guidelines have been amended with the approval of the Hon’ble Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, as per details given below:

    i)  Funds under NeGPA for the current financial year (2020-21) will be release to States only for the project involving use of modern Information Technologies mentioned above such as Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Block Chain Technology, Internet of Things, Robotics etc., and for customization / shifting of web & mobile applications already developed by the States, to the platform to be developed using digital technologies mentioned above.

    ii) Evaluation of the projects submitted by the States (with Central and State share as per existing sharing pattern) will be done by a Committee headed by the Jt. Secretary (IT), the Deptt. of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare with representative of the Division concerned in the Department with area/field of the project and a representative of NIC not below the rank of DDG as Members and the Director (IT) as Member

  Secretary of the Committee.

iii) No funds will be released for procurement of hardware, manpower, site preparation etc. for financial year 2020-21.

iv) Funds already released under the scheme and remained un-utilized and re-validated, may be utilized for the purposes it was released.
