1. ## **Introduction**

   Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched on 1st July, 2015 with the objective to achieve convergence of investments in irrigation sector at field level. The scheme aims at providing end-to-end solutions in irrigation supply chain, viz. water sources, distribution network and farm level applications. PMKSY not only focuses on creating water sources for assured irrigation, but it is also creating protective irrigation by harnessing rain water at micro level through „Jal Sanchay‟ and „Jal Sinchan‟. Micro irrigation is an integral component of the scheme to maximise water use efficiency at farm level. PMKSY adopts state level planning and projectised execution that allows states to draw up their own irrigation development based on District irrigation Plans and State Irrigation Plan.

2. ## **Programme components of PMKSY**

   Components of the PMKSY are as under:

   1. **Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP)** – to focus on faster completion of ongoing Major and Medium Irrigation projects – being implemented by MOWR, RD\&GR.

   2. **PMKSY (Har Khet KoPani)** – to focuson source augmentation, distribution, ground water development, lift irrigation, diversion of water from water plenty to water scarce areas, supplementing rain water harvesting beyond IWMP & MGNREGA, repair, restoration, renovation of traditional water bodies etc. – being implemented by MoWR, RD\&GR.

   3. **PMKSY (Per Drop More Crop)** – to focus on micro level storage structures, efficient water conveyance & application, precision irrigation systems, topping up of input cost beyond MGNREGA permissible limits, secondary storage, water lifting devices, extension activities, coordination & management \- being implemented by DAC\&FW.

   4. **PMKSY (Watershed Development)** \- to focus on ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, water harvesting structure, livelihood support activities and other watershed works being implemented by DoLR.

3. ## **Programme Architecture**

   1. Per Drop More Crops (Micro Irrigation) will adopt the institutional set up and architecture of overall PMKSY framework as given in the Operational Guidelines of PMKSY. The broad institutional structure as per PMKSY Guideline are:

      1) National Steering Committee (NSC) under the Chairmanship of Hon‟ble Prime Minister with Union Ministers from concerned ministries and Vice chairman, NITI Aayog as members to provide general policy strategic directions for programme implementation and overall supervision addressing national priorities etc.

      2) National Executive Committee (NEC)under the Chairmanship of Vice Chairman, Niti Aayog with Secretaries of concerned ministries/departments and Chief Secretaries of selected States as members to oversee programme implementation, allocation of resources, Inter-ministerial coordination, monitoring & performance assessment, addressing administrative issues etc.

      3) PMKSY Mission Directorate has been established in Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation for mission mode implementation of 99 major and medium irrigation projects. The Mission is also responsible for overall coordination and outcome focused monitoring of all components of PMKSY for achieving its target.

      4) State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary of the State to sanction projects and activities as recommended by IDWG.

      5) Inter Departmental Working Group (IDWG) under the Chairmanship of Agriculture Production Commissioner/ Development Commissioner with Secretaries of line departments as members. States, if they feel, may take the advice /input of MI manufacturers by inviting representative from manufacturers/ Micro Irrigation Industries as special invitee.

      6) District Level Implementation Committee (DLIC) under the Chairmanship of Collector/District Magistrate / CEO of Zila Parishad/ PD DRDA, Joint Director/Deputy director of line departments in the district and progressive farmers, representative of MI industry, and leading NGO as members to oversee PMKSY implementation and inter-departmental coordination.

4. ## **Nodal Department**

   1. Since the final outcome of PMKSY is to ensure access to efficient delivery and application of water at every farm thereby enhancing agricultural production & productivity, State Agriculture Department may be the Nodal Department for implementation of PMKSY (Per Drop More Crop). However, State Govt. is free to identify the nodal department based on the established institutional set up and mandate of the department. All communication between Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and State Government would be with and through the nodal department.

   2. States are free to identify dedicated implementing agencies/departments for implementation of Per Drop More Crop (Micro Irrigation). If two departments are assigned for implementation, one department be designated as the nodal department.

5. ## **District and State Irrigation Plans (DIPs& SIPs**)

   1. District Irrigation Plans (DIPs) are the cornerstone for planning and implementation of different components of PMKSY which will identify gaps in irrigation infrastructure after taking into consideration the District Agriculture Plans (DAPs) vis-à-vis irrigation infrastructure currently available and resources that would be added from ongoing schemes, both State and Central.

   2. DIPs present holistic irrigation development perspective of the district outlining medium to long term development plans integrating three components viz. water sources, distribution network and water use applications.

   3. The annual action plans for **Per Drop More Crop (Micro Irrigation)** will be drawn from DIPs and implemented in conjunction with the water sources created under PMKSY in cluster mode for holistic development as far as possible.

6. ## **Objectives of Per Drop More Crop (Micro Irrigation)**

The main objectives of Per Drop More Crop (Micro Irrigation) are as under

1. Increase the area under micro irrigation technologies to enhance water use efficiency in the country.

   2. Increase productivity of crops and income of farmers through precision water management.

   3. Promote micro irrigation technologies in water intensive/consuming crops like sugarcane, banana, cotton etc and give adequate focus to extend coverage of field crops under micro irrigation technologies.

   4. Make potential use of micro irrigation systems for promoting fertigation.

   5. Promote micro irrigation technologies in water scarce, water stressed and critical ground water blocks/districts

   6. Link tube-well / river-lift irrigation projects with micro irrigation technologies for best use of energy both for lifting and pressurised irrigation as far as possible.

   7. Establish convergence and synergy with activities of on-going programmes and schemes, particularly with created water source for its potential use, integration of solar energy for pressurised irrigation etc.

   8. Promote, develop and disseminate micro irrigation technology for agriculture and horticulture development with modern scientific knowledge.

   9. Create employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled persons, especially unemployed youth for installation and maintenance of micro irrigation systems.

7. ## **Implementation Strategies**

   1. Water is becoming scarce commodity these days due to competitive demand and also due to the change in climatic behaviour, particularly the erratic nature of rainfall. The available water sources or the new sources those are being created need to be used in best possible manner to fulfil the vision of “Har Khet Ko Pani” and “Per Drop More Crop” of PMKSY through efficient water conservation (Jal Sanchaya) and water management (Jal Sinchan) practices. It

   is in this context more vital to link most of the water sources with micro irrigation to get extended coverage for a longer duration. Cluster approach may be adopted in irrigation chain development, to have effective integration of source, connectivity, distribution and application.

   2. It is desirable to make potential use of the available water for sustained growth in agriculture sector. Preference should be given to adopt Micro Irrigation technology in water guzzling crops like sugarcane, cotton, banana, etc. and the state implementing agencies should take suitable steps like publicity campaigns, policy provisions & sharing responsibilities with the Micro Irrigation industry so that adoption of technology is initiated in such crops. Industry related to the specific crops like sugar factories should be actively involved in promotion of micro irrigation to their farmers through incentivisation and technical supervision. Apart from horticulture and water guzzling crops, cereals and pulses may also be brought under the ambit of Micro irrigation.

   3. In all the new irrigation commands where hydraulic heads are available, drip irrigation systems need to be encouraged as it can be operated without additional energy support.

   4. Facilities of micro irrigation is underutilised if it is not used for fertigation. States should encourage the use of liquid fertilizers using micro irrigation systems. Availability of liquid fertilisers, awareness among farmers on the benefits of fertigation need to given desired attention for promoting fertigation.

   5. Efforts may be made for integration of micro irrigation with solar pumping units. A solar water pump has a mini power house at its heart and consists of a calibrated and matching solar array of modules – tuned with the equivalent power of pump for that particular application. The solar water pumping system is capable of running all types of electrical water pumps with applications varying from irrigation to household demands. Irrigation pumps such as submersible, surface or deep well can also be coupled with drip irrigation systems to enhance the returns from this configuration. A 2000 Watt Peak (WP) solar water pump is capable of drawing and pumping approximately 80,000 litres of water per day from a source that is up to 10 meters deep. This is sufficient to irrigate about 1 ha of land with regular crops.

   6. More focus and priority be given for promoting micro irrigation technologies in water scarce, water stressed and critical ground water blocks/districts to conserve water and get extended coverage in terms of area and time period for live saving irrigation. Where ever feasible efforts be made to Link tube-well

   / river-lift irrigation projects with micro irrigation technologies for best use of energy both for lifting and pressurised irrigation.

   7. Assistance for installation of micro irrigation system is limited to five hectares per beneficiary. The land holding of a beneficiary to be covered under drip/sprinkler system could be located in one contiguous area or at different locations, but the financial assistance will be limited to the overall ceiling of 5 ha. Those beneficiaries, who have already availed subsidy benefits for his /her farm, can not avail the assistance for the next seven years. A beneficiary if

   availed the benefit of subsidy for micro irrigation for a particular farm would be eligible for subsidy again for the same land only after the end of projected life of the micro irrigation system which is 7 years.

   8. In case of Cooperative/group farming, members of cooperative societies, self- help groups, incorporated companies, panchayatiraj institutions, NGOs, Trusts, growers‟ associations will be entitled to avail financial assistance through their respective bodies. In such cases, the individual beneficiary will receive financial assistance only through the respective organizations with in the overall ceiling of 5 ha per beneficiary.

   9. Beneficiaries/Institutions that have opted for contract farming or taken land on lease are also eligible for obtaining financial assistance under the scheme. However, to become eligible, the beneficiary/institution shall have to produce lease agreement for a minimum period of seven years from the date of approval of application by the MI implementing agency.

   10. Raw material price of polymers & other costs varies a lot because of fluctuation in national/international prices. Accordingly, the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India would consider revision of unit cost norms periodically if found necessary.

   11. PFDCs, ICAR, CIPET, ATMA etc and other reputed NGOs may be involved in planning, implementation, demonstration, training and evaluation under the scheme. The implementing agency at the district level will ensure convergence of activities under the programme with the activities of various departments on water management to get the desired output.

8. ## **Drip Irrigation System for states where it has been well accepted by farmers and good infrastructure is available**

   1. The scheme is well accepted by the farmers and substantial coverage has been made under micro irrigation system compared to other parts of the country with required infrastructure and service facilities in the States namely Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Goa, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. These states are considered to be category “A” States with comparatively better penetration of micro irrigation technologies.

   2. Drip Irrigation technology involves irrigating root zone through emitters fitted on a lateral tube as well as inserted within the tubing as emitting pipe. The use of different emitters will depend upon specific requirements, which may vary from crop to crop.

   3. Fertigation is important for getting the maximum benefits out of the micro irrigation technology. Therefore, it is mandatory to use a fertigation device by the farmers such as venturi injector or fertilizer tank on which the subsidy is available.

   4. Water requirement, age of plant, plant to plant spacing, soil type, water quality and availability etc are some of the factors which decide the choice of emitting system. The indicative cost of drip irrigation systems (assuming peak water requirement with source of water at the corner of plot), for different

   lateral spacing and plot sizes has been provided in the guidelines. An indicative list of system components required for installing a drip irrigation system in the areas ranging from 0.4 ha to 5 ha is at **Annexure-IV a to f**, on the basis of which subsidy will be calculated as per Table 1:

## **Table 1: Indicative cost of Drip Irrigation System for calculation of subsidy**

**(Cost in Rs.)**

| 1.2x0.6 | 40000 | 100000 | 200000 | 323019 | 435788 | 545181 |

5. The unit cost of Drip Irrigation system varies with respect to plant spacing and location of the water source.

   6. Assistance under the scheme is available for all types of drip irrigation systems such as on-line & in-line drip irrigation systems.

   7. In case of crops with plant spacing other than those mentioned in Table-1a, the amount of assistance could be calculated on pro rata/average basis of the nearest plant spacing. Alternatively, assistance amount may be calculated as per the unit cost of the nearest spacing of plants.

   8. As small farm holdings may not have individual source of water, it would be preferable to encourage a group of farmers to avail the benefits of drip irrigation through a common water source.

   9. A beneficiary having farms located at different places and having different water source may avail the subsidy as per the guidelines. However, a beneficiary cannot split area at one location into small pockets of the same crop for claiming assistance under the scheme. If a beneficiary has more than one crop with different crop spacing being grown separately in his/her land holding, assistance will be available for installing the drip irrigation system as per the individual crop spacing, the combined area of which will not exceed 5 ha per beneficiary.

   10. In case of inter-cropping, assistance will be available for the prescribed plant spacing/ area, subject to the condition that the assistance will be provided only for one crop as per the farmers‟ choice.

9. ## **Drip Irrigation System in states with low penetration**

   1. Based on the prevailing coverage and acceptance by farmers, states namely Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Union Territories have been identified as states with low penetration of micro irrigation technology. These states are considered as category “B” in terms of implementation of micro irrigation. The cost of drip system is likely to be higher in these states due to various factors such as lesser presence of manufacturing companies in these states leading to higher cost of transportation, the companies will have to make considerable efforts in making the farmers ready for adoption of technology, and higher cost involved in providing after sales service in these states etc. Thus, 15% higher cost has been taken in consideration while working out the unit cost of drip system in the table below for these states for the purpose of subsidy calculation as per indicative list of system components given at Annexure \- IV a to f.

      ## **Table 2: Indicative cost of Drip Irrigation System for calculation of subsidy in the states where penetration level is low**

10. ## **Drip Irrigation System for North Eastern and Himalayan States**

    1. The coverage of MI system in North Eastern and hilly region is much low due to poor infrastructure and difficult terrain. The states namely Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are considered under category “C”.  In the Hilly states, following points need to be kept in mind while designing a drip irrigation system keeping in view the sloppy and terraced land:

* It is difficult to lay PVC main and sub-main lines below the ground surface and therefore HDPE pipes are required in place of PVC.

* The undulating and vertical slopes would lead to comparatively larger length of pipes.

* To maintain uniform pressure and to irrigate upper most terrace of land, control valve should be provided at sub-main/main lines at 4m vertical drop. Accordingly, the number of flush valves will also increase.

  2. The cost of drip system is likely to be higher in North Eastern & Himalayan states because of the terrain, higher transport cost, lesser presence of manufacturing companies etc. Therefore, unit cost of micro irrigation systems is taken 25% higher in these states for the purpose of subsidy calculations and is given in table 1b below (including 25%) for the indicative list of system components is at **Annexure \-IV g to l**.

16. ## **Violations & Penalties**

    1. The Central & State Governments, micro irrigation suppliers/manufacturers and other stake holders are putting in a lot of efforts for effective operations of micro irrigation systems. Any wrong operations could lead to system failure & financial loss to the beneficiary apart from loss of faith in the technology. It is, therefore, important to have well defined measures / terms for violation of norms by the stake-holders. Any violation to the quality, maintenance and other parameters need be viewed seriously. The list of violations mentioned below is not exhaustive and any other deviations, which affect the implementation of the scheme adversely may be considered by the DMIC/SLC as deemed fit for smooth functioning of the same.

    2. A due process, where show cause is issued and adequate time is allowed for response, shall be followed and the MI companies as well as the beneficiary shall be adequately heard and natural justice provided.

    3. In case of violations in respect of failure in quality control \&quality assurance and to provide maintenance & after sales service, following penalties shall be imposed:

       * First time in a year, a warning letter may be issued to the manufacturer instructing to rectify the shortcoming immediately.  
       * Second time in same year, a warning letter may be issued to the manufacturer instructing to rectify the shortcoming immediately with a penalty of 10% of invoice value.

       * Third time in same year, a penalty of 25% of invoice value may be charged.  
       * Fourth time in same year, a show cause notice may be issued to the company and the case may be refer to SLSC for de-listing the company for a period of one year or more as decided by SLSC.

    4. The violations with regard to submission of bills without installation/partial installation, wrong invoicing, variations in component specifications, submission of wrong documents with reference to pump/system discharge, improper installation, quoting higher price than approved, deviations from prescribed material specifications etc. may be dealt with by the SLSC suitably apart from initiating suitable action under the relevant sections of Indian penal code and other relevant/ appropriate statutory enactments.

    5. In case of sale of the MI system to other farmers before expiry of average life of the system, for which subsidy has been claimed by the beneficiary, legal proceedings against the beneficiary as per applicable law may be initiated and the beneficiary may be blacklisted from availing any government assistance in future.

17. ## **Quality Control**

    1. Crucial aspect of supply of micro irrigation systems is the quality of hardware which is delivered to the farmer. It needs to be ensured that quality components having BIS marking (wherever applicable) are installed in the beneficiary field. Poor quality has an adverse impact on performance of the system which may affect yield of the crop, quantity of water applied, quantity of fertilizer delivered to the plant etc. It may also increase energy consumption. In fact, sub-standard system will not only adversely impact performance, but could also reduce the durability and the life of the components and/or system.

    2. The SLSC shall form joint inspection teams for field inspection and frequent surveillance by inspection teams will be a regular feature under the Scheme. They will draw random samples periodically from the field, within a period of three years from the date of installation of the system. At the time of inspection, the system should be fully functional. The report should be submitted to the competent authority under SLSC for further action.

    3. While one surveillance visit per operative year shall be kept as the general norm, more or less inspections may be planned depending on the performance or specific guidelines issued by SLSC.

    4. Samples for testing should be collected jointly by the joint inspection team, state nodal official and the company representatives in triplicate and properly labelled, sealed and signed. The samples are collected for all major system components, especially pipes & tubing. One set of samples should be sent to CIPET/BIS or any other approved product testing laboratory for testing as the SLSC may deem fit, another set is to be preserved in the custody of nodal officer and the third one is to be with the manufacturer. After collection of samples at random, they should be coded as per BIS guidelines for the purpose of security and further reference.

    5. Collection of samples with batch number is mandatory. The samples may be collected from the beneficiaries‟ fields as well as the supply chain of the manufacturer after the product has been dispatched from the manufacturing unit.

    6. The quantity of material required for conducting the test is as detailed below:

| Sl. No. | Test | Test samples required |

The publicity campaigns at block/ district/state level need be undertaken by the state nodal agencies and expenses for the same will be met from the administrative expenses earmarked under PMKSY.

19. ## **Pattern of Assistance & funding pattern**

    1. The total financial assistance available to the beneficiary under the micro irrigation scheme from both Central and State Governments would be 55% for small & marginal farmers & 45% for other farmers. The unit cost would be limited to the Indicative costs mentioned in the guidelines for various technologies and areas as given at Annexure Nos. IV to IX.

    2. Funding of financial assistance \- under the Per Drop More Crop (Micro Irrigation) component of PMKSY the subsidy amount payable to the beneficiary will be shared in the ratio of 60:40 between the Central & State Governments for all states except North Eastern & Himalayan states, where the sharing will

    be in the ratio of 90:10.In the case of Union Territories, the scheme will be funded 100% by the Central Government.

20. ## **Progress reporting, monitoring and evaluation**

    1. Government of India has been emphasising on the use of modern tools for online reporting and sharing of information. Accordingly, a web-based portal and information management system has been developed and operationalised for different components of PMKSY. The objective of this web-portal is to have effective monitoring of the progress under different components of PMKSY and sharing of information and documents. Therefore, the states must use this website for reporting the physical & financial progress under different components of PMKSY including micro irrigation scheme and get information/documents like fund release orders, circular letters etc. and other useful information through the web-portal. The web-portal links are as under:-

[http://pmksy.gov.in\>](http://pmksy.gov.in/)Components\>PerDropMoreCrop-MI\>ProgressMonitoring [http://aps.DAC\&FW.gov.in/MI/Login.aspx](http://aps.dac.gov.in/MI/Login.aspx)

2. The physical & financial progress must be uploaded on web-portal on monthly basis by 5th of every month for the preceding month. It may be noted that annual data of the preceding year will be free-zed by 30th June and thereafter no changes could be made. It may also be ensured that “each micro irrigation installation will be given a unique digital code and the same will appear on the web portal of PMKSY”. The physical/ financial progress report is to be submitted by 5th of next month as per the format at Annexure-IIIa and IIIb. Biometric registration of beneficiary & geo tagging should be made compulsory.

   3. National Committee on Plasticulture Application in Horticulture (NCPAH) will be involved in monitoring and reviewing the progress of scheme at the National level. NCPAH secretariat will provide necessary logistic support to the ministry for this purpose and maintain statistical data base/information on various aspects of the Micro Irrigation.

   4. DAC\&FW will evolve suitable mechanism for concurrent evaluation of implementation of PMKSY (Per Drop More Crop). DAC\&FW may also engage suitable agency for conducting state specific/pan-India/ implementation monitoring and/or mid-term/end-term evaluation of the scheme. NRAA will be involved in the process of mid-term/end-term evaluation of the programme. An Impact Evaluation Study on Micro Irrigation at the National level will also be undertaken through an independent Agency with involvement of NCPAH once in every three years of implementation to assess the impact of the scheme in increasing water use efficiency, productivity, enhancement of farmers‟ income, technology adoption and other parameters. Twenty five percent (25%) of the projects sanctioned by the State shall have to be compulsorily taken up for third party monitoring and evaluation by the implementing states.

   5. Action plan for monitoring and evaluation will be decided by SLSC at the beginning of every year based on project cost, importance of the project and

   other parameters, preferably covering all sectors. The State Government will be free to choose any reputed agencies for conducting the monitoring and evaluation work in their states. Requisite fees/cost towards monitoring & evaluation will be met by the state government from 5% allocation retained by them for administrative expenses. The performance of the states will be reflected in the Outcome Budget document of the respective Ministry/Department.

21. ## **Release of Funds**

    1. Funds to the tune of 60% of annual allocation to the state under different components of PMKSY will be released as first instalment to the State upon receipt of proposal in the prescribed format along with specified documents including annual action plan approved by state level sanctioning committee (SLSC) along with minutes of SLSC meeting approving the annual action plan of the state. Suggestive formats for annual action plan are enclosed at **Annexure-II**. The concerned implementing ministry/department at the Centre will be responsible to ensure receipt of utilisation certificate and corresponding physical and financial progress report while releasing the funds for the specific component. The utilisation certificate is to be submitted by the respective implementing department/agency in the state.

    2. Release of the second and final instalment would be considered on receipt of the following:

       * More than 90% Utilisation Certificates (UCs) for the funds released up to previous financial year;  
       * Utilisation Certificates (UCs) of at least 50% of funds released in first instalment during current year;  
       * Performance report in terms of physical and financial achievements as well as outcomes, within the stipulated time frame in specified format.

    3. If a State fails to submit proposal for release of funds with specified documents within reasonable period of time, the balance funds may be re- allocated to better performing States.

22. ## **Administrative Expenses and Contingencies**

    1. Administrative expenses may be met on pro-rata basis from the programme not exceeding 5 percent at each level to strengthen coordination, scientific planning and technical support for effective implementation of different components of PMKSY including micro irrigation at the field level. Administrative expenditure for functioning of coordinating agency/Institutions responsible for implementing the components of PMKSY, engagement of contractual staff for monitoring and operating the MI System, payments to consultants, outsourcing of specific activities, recurring expenses of various kinds, procurement of android driven smart phones/tablets for uploading of App for geo tagging in Bhuvan Platform, staff costs etc. are admissible. However, no permanent employment can be created, nor vehicles can be purchased. States may supplement any administrative expenditure in excess of the 5% limit, from their own resources.

    2. Govt. of India may retain 1.5% of the PMKSY provision for IEC activities and another 1.5% of the scheme allocation for administrative, monitoring, evaluation and any contingencies that may arise during the implementation of the scheme by each participating departments. DAC\&FW may set up a technical support group by assigning dedicated officers and staff from its existing strength and engaging consultants, experts etc. DAC\&FW may outsource some technical assignments to specific agencies including studies, training programmes relating to PMKSY activities and conduct activities such as workshops, conferences, awareness campaign, publicity, documentation etc.
