  Subject: Implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Klsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme - regarding

  Madam/ Sir,

  As you are aware, the new Central Sector Scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Klsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN} Scheme, seeking to provide income support to all Small and Marginal landholder farmers' families with cultivable land holding upto 2 hectare across the country, by way of payment of Rs.6000/- per year, subject to certain exclusions, has been launched on the 24^(th) February, 2019. The amount is being credited into the accounts of the beneficiaries held in destination banks, through the accredited bank of Department and sponsoring bank of the State/UT, using PFMS portal.

2.  The first lot of tran:sf.e,,r. of 1^(st) installment has already been transferred into the accounts of the beneficiaries. However, it has been reported that some non-benefiiciaries have also

'

  received the amount in their bank accounts and may want to return this amount to the Government.

3.  Considering that the benefit under the scheme is envisaged to be given in 3 installments, the money to be transferred back requires to be tagged with the transaction by which it was initiated. The concerned State Governments, therefore, need to delete such beneficiaries from their database in order to stop further payments to such beneficiaries.

4.  Considering the complexities, it is suggested that such beneficiaries shall ask their respective destination banks to reverse the entry. The returned amount will be deposited by the bank in the accredited banks' separate account for the purpose. As the accredited banks will be having the UTR and IIN of the beneficiaries, the money will be sent to the PAO through receipt scroll along with the UTR and IIN of the beneficiaries. As the receipt is received by the PAO, the same shall be communicated to the Programme Division for communicating to the concerned State for clearing of the name from the database of the beneficiaries' details.

5.  In the alternative to 4 above, if the beneficiary wants to return the money through the State Government, the State Government shall assist the beneficiaries to return the money through the NRTP portal named as Bharatkosh.gov.in. The user guide is available on the website to assist in filing the data which enables the fund to get deposited in the government's account of Ministry of Agriculture. The details of the beneficiary shall be also

  deleted by the State Government from the beneficiaries' list under intimation to the

  Programme Division.

Yours sincerely,
