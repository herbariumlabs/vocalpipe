  The Farmer Registry is a pivotal initiative under Digital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture (Agri Stack) aimed at creating a comprehensive and unified Registry of farmers across the country. This registry plays a crucial role in ensuring that government schemes and benefits reach the right beneficiaries efficiently. The registry not only enhances transparency but also streamlines the distribution of agricultural subsidies, insurance, and other support systems. The Farmer Registry is integral to the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, enabling better planning, policymaking, and resource allocation to improve the livelihoods of farmers.

  Farmer Registry establishes verifiability of a farmer by linking the farmer ID with the land ownership.

  []Pre-requisites in Detail

  State should establish a designated authority for decisions on Farmer registry, grievance management and more.

  State to decide on the acceptable name match score level for automatic approval of farmers during registration.

  State needs to establish linkage of State RoR system with the Mutation system which results in instantaneous update of RoR after approval of mutation

  State to permit linkage of state Farmer Registry to State Records of Rights (for flagging/marking land ownership change, and subsequent updates in the RoR)

  State Government to undertake incentivisation of intermediaries for enrolment or update of Farmer registry

  State Government to identify operational staff for identification and verification of land claims

  State Government to select the modes of Farmer registrations

  To ·s []blish a comprehensive State Farmer Registry, state governments can adopt a tiered approach to farmer registration, ensuring accessibility for all farmers regardless of their technical proficiency or location.

1.  The Farmer Self-Registration is a part of the Digital India movement. It lets farmers sign up on their own using an easy app, giving them the power to use technology by themselves. This online platform facilitates a straightforward sign-up process, allowing farmers to create their profiles with ease followed by log in, eKYC, mobile verification, claiming their land buckets, giving consent and doing eSignature.

2.  For those needing assistance, the Assisted Mode presents three distinct options:

    a.  State Camp Mode, where state officials set up temporary registration camps in villages. This approach targets farmers in remote areas, offering on-the-spot registration services including eKYC, claiming of land buckets and Consent collection with e-sign by different or same Government officials and often waiving certain verification requirements like the name match score due to the direct supervision of government officials who may already be familiar with the local farmers.

    b.  Sahayak Assistance: Local Sahayaks, individuals well-versed in the application process, provide personalized support to farmers, assisting with document collection, form filling, and ensuring all registration requirements are met..

    c.  CSC Operator Assistance: At Common Service Centers, CSC operators use their expertise to guide farmers through the registration, leveraging the CSC's infrastructure for a smooth experience, including eKYC, claiming of land buckets and Consent collection with e-sign on behalf of farmers and payment processing through CSC bridge payment gateway and form submission.

3.  State Government Office: Farmers can visit designated state government offices where officials help them navigate the registration process, ensuring accurate entry of information, claiming of land buckets and completion of necessary steps and verifications.

  Through the implementation of these delineated registration frameworks (modes/methods), state governments can cater to the diverse needs of their farming communities, ensuring every farmer could be included in the State Farmer Registry.

Mode 1 : Self Mode (Farmer Self Registration}

  Farmers can self-register using the Farmer Registry mobile app or web portal. This requires initial sign-up to create login credentials, followed by an eKYC verification using Aadhaar, completion of form with basic details. The claiming of land buckets is done on the system using the land survey numbers and consent of farmer is taken along with eSignature. After submission, Farmer gets an enrolment ID to track application status. State FR may auto-approve based on 'name match score threshold' as set at State level or forward for verification by government officer before final approval.

8)  Farmers should not share personal information like bank details or OTPs with anyone over the phone.

  Mode 2(a} : Farmer Registration through State Government CAMP

  In State Government camp mode, farmers register at identified locations within their village as decided by State and District administrations. This mode is exclusive to landowners in the designated village. The state delegates responsibilities among department/s to handle handles eKYC, form completion, and managing land claims, consent, and eSignature-all assisting the farmer's coming to the camp. Advantage of these camps is the familiarity of local officials with farmers and their direct supervision. The state may choose to waive off name match score requirement.

Mode 2 {b): Farmer registration by Sahayak

  In assisted mode, farmers can register in the Farmer Registry through a Sahayak, an individual skilled in application use and form filling. The Sahayak signs up on the mobile app using their Aadhaar and mobile number, then logs in to assist the farmer directly. They collect the farmer's Aadhaar, mobile number, and land documents, conduct eKYC, complete the registration form, claim land, obtain consent, and execute eSignature on behalf of the farmer. Submission generates an enrolment number for tracking and sets up a farmer account, similar to self-registration. Applications are auto-approved or sent for manual approval by a verifier officer, based on the state's name match score criteria. Approved farmers receive a unique farmer ID.

Mode 2 (c}: Farmer registration by CSC Operator

  States may consider engaging CSCs for assisting enrolment of Farmers. The CSC operator uses CSC credentials as would be pre-enabled for registration. The operator then assists the farmer by collecting their Aadhaar, mobile number, and land documents, conducting eKYC, completing the registration form, claiming land, obtaining consent, and facilitating eSignature. Payment is processed through the CSC bridge payment gateway. Successful transactions generate an enrolment number for the farmer to track their application. Based on the state's name match score criteria, applications are auto-approved or reviewed by a verifier officer. Approved farmers are then granted a unique farmer ID.

Mode 3: Farmer Registration at Government Office

  Farmers can sign up for the Farmer Registry in person at a designated state government office. A state­ authorized official accesses the system using state-provided credentials and assists the farmer in person. The official gathers the farmer's Aadhaar, mobile number, and land documents, then performs eKYC, fills out the registration form, claims land, obtains consent, and completes eSignature for the farmer. Upon form submission, an enrolment number is issued for tracking. Applications are then auto-approved or sent to a verifier officer for manual approval, depending on the state's name match score criteria. Once approved, farmers are assigned a unique farmer ID.

Farmer Registry Application Verification and Approval Process

Farmer Registry Application Verification Process

- After registering through one of the three modes, farmers are immediately assigned an enrolment number, which they can use to monitor the status of their application in the Farmer Registry. The verification process begins based on the state's specific policies, particularly focusing on criteria like the Name Match Score (NMS) and approval guidelines. If the application meets the state's auto-approval criteria, such as a high NMS, it is automatically approved, and a Farmer ID is promptly issued in next 24 hours of approval. This process ensures that eligible farmers are quickly registered, facilitating their access to government services.

- For applications that do not qualify for auto-approval, a manual review process is initiated. Government officers at various levels are responsible for thoroughly checking the application details against official records to ensure accuracy. This multi-level review adds layers of verification, reducing the likelihood of errors and ensuring that only eligible farmers receive a Farmer ID. While this process may take longer, it is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the Farmer Registry.

- Once the application passes all necessary checks, a Farmer ID is generated and assigned to the farmer's enrolment. This ID is essential for accessing various agricultural benefits and schemes. The entire process balances the need for thorough verification with the goal of minimizing delays, ensuring that farmers can swiftly access the support they need from the government.

Name Match Score (NMS) and Application Approval

- The Name Match Score (NMS) is a key factor in determining whether a farmer's application will be auto-approved or require manual verification. States may categorize NMS into various levels

- This system streamlines the registration process for applications with a high degree of accuracy, reducing the workload on government officials and speeding up the issuance of Farmer IDs.

- For applications with an average NMS, typically between 31 and 79, manual verification is required. Government officers must carefully review these applications to ensure that the information matches official records. This step is crucial for preventing errors and ensuring that only those who meet all the necessary criteria receive a Farmer ID. In contrast, applications with a poor NMS score, below 31, require the farmer to correct discrepancies in their official records, such as Aadhaar or land documents, before they can proceed with registration.

- The use of NMS in the verification process allows for a more efficient and accurate registration system. It ensures that applications with high accuracy are fast-tracked, while those with potential discrepancies are given the attention needed to maintain the integrity of the Farmer Registry. This approach helps balance the need for quick processing with the importance of accurate and fair verification.

- Excellent (80-100): Auto-approved for Farmer ID.

- Average (31-79): Requires manual verification by government officers.

- Poor (0-30): Farmer must correct discrepancies in official records (Aadhaar, land documents, etc.) before proceeding.

Handling legal heir in Farmer Registry (1/2)

  Updating of a land record is required because of two primary reasons-

a)  Sale transaction of the land

b)  Succession due to death of the owner farmer

  For a) Sale Transaction,

  the state registration system is (typically) integrated with State Land Record System (in most major states). Therefore, after any registered transaction of land, the data is updated in the State land record system and mutation is triggered. And as per state norms, after a statutory period the updating of land record happens against the current owner of the land.

  For b) Succession due to death of owner farmer,

  the Mutation gets initiated only after the inheritance/succession information is given by the legal heirs to the revenue department.

- There are various reasons in our society, where many families DO NOT come forward seeking succession-based mutations.

  Secondly, for the purposes of Farmer Registry, it is important to have current share of land i.e., extent of land of an owner to give benefit. The record of rights system may have joint owner, but the Farmer registry provides facility to assign land parcel extent based on 'imputed full' or 'imputed equal share' basis. Imputed equal share can be distributed as declared with the consent of all the joint owners.

  Therefore, while sharing data with use cases, all the joint owners' details will be shared whenever any of joint owner details are sought.

  As and when joint owners become individual owners through registered transaction, a new FARM ID will be generated for each of the owner and previous FARM ID will be deactivated.

  Some update in Farmer Registry are made possible to RoR entries to handle dead owners and allotment of share to joint owners. This is possible as:

a.  Farmer Registry is not designed for and cannot be, considered as replica of State Land records systems, because - one, it will not contain deceased farmers and two, mutations on registered transactions can get delayed. In both these cases since the benefits should be given to the current land holding farmer, the Farmer Registry will have his/her name only (not the previous owner or seller's name).

b.  Farmer Registry, system will allow farmers to get their land data updated to handle the time delay due to mutation in State RoR system. To do this Farmer will require to submit relevant documents to STATE designated authority (for the purpose of Farmer registry maintenance) for updating land in their name because of death or sale transaction. It is again emphasised that Farmer Registry is only for benefits purposes, an entry in it does not bestow legal right

c.  The current Farmer Registry system has capabilities to allow farmers to get their land data updated to handle above two limitations of State RoR systems.

  EVERY TIME A LEGAL HEIR IS REGISTERED AND ASSIGNED LAND PARCEL ON FARMER REGISTRY (especially for

  succession due to death of owner farmer) DATA PERTAINING TO LAND WOULD BE SHARED WITH STATE RoR SYSTEM. THE STATE RoR SYSTEM, if permitted by State Government, CAN PROACTIVELY START INHERITANCE MUTATION after receiving such information from Farmer Registry. THIS WILL HELP UPDATING STATE RoR.

  NOT ABLY, as and when State RoR system is updated, the Farmer Registry system will consume the same

  information of ownership in a synchronous manner. Therefore, for any conflict between Farmer Registry and State RoR system, the State RoR will have overruling power on Farmer Registry data with respect to ownership of land and the extent assigned to a given Farmer ID.

  Example: In State of Uttar Pradesh, the owner of Land parcel with farm id "UP34521213873" has passed away (is deceased) and there are 4 legal heirs A, B, C, and D. The legal heirs may approach Farmer Registry for assigning the said land parcel to their Farmer ID.

Handling legal heir in Farmer Registry (2/2)

  Since, no inheritance/partition mutation has happened so far, Farmer Registry will consider A, B, C and D as joint owners. The extent will be assigned based on State Policy for Farmer Registry which ca be 'imputed full' or 'imputed equal'. Farmer Registry will electronically inform RoR system, that system has assigned said land parcel to legal heirs and the Revenue department may consider initiating inheritance mutation, for the deceased land owner. While performing inheritance mutation, if State Revenue authorities have identified DIFFERENT legal heirs or deleted legal heirs in comparison to those available State Farmer Registry, during synchronisation, updating of Farmer Registry will adhere to what has been done in Land Records System. This may even involve de-assigning land parcel for farmer or assigning land parcel to different farmer (which is as per State RoR). It may also mean adding joint owner to the list of new joint owners, if joint owners don't have farmer id.

  In case of states where 'imputed equal share' has been opted as a policy, the extent of ownership (share) may also change after partition among family members in RoR System.

  FOR CASES WHEN THERE IS CONFLICT DURING MUTATION, the RoR system shall electronically inform the Farmer Registry, so that lands assigned to legal heirs be changed as per RoR.

  In case of Sales transaction, the State Farmer Registry would have assigned land parcel to the buyer based on the request and supporting documents.. In majority of sales transactions (>99%), the mutations are accepted, and the buyer is able to acquire the rights on the land parcel after mutation. In cases where mutation is rejected (based on eligibility of the buyer), the seller would lose the rights on the land in any case. In light of this it is safe to assign transacted land parcel to buyer and intimate RoR system electronically (through API call) about the said ownership change. This intimation will help revenue department to revert back to FR, in case if mutation is not approved. Based on such intimations from revenue department land parcel can be de-assigned from buyer/ farmer in FR

  At the time of field verification of Farmers and creation of Farmer ID, the local revenue officials or the operators, can point out all deceased farmers. Technologically, the face authentication element of registration (Aadhaar eKYC) will not allow deceased farmers to get included. The State revenue officials at the field level can inform legal heirs for getting included into Farmer Registry. The Standard Operating Procedure will guide the revenue officials to assign lands to new owners if mutations have not taken place after sales transactions.

  For the case of joint ownership, the farmer registry may put whole extent of land against each joint owner. Subsequently, these joint owners may need to make a request for apportionment/distribution/partition of extent of a land with the State designated authority for updating the Farmer registry. This will be done for the purpose of use cases/benefits which require share of ownership of land.

  IMPLICATIONS ON USE CASES IN STATE

- The use case should be designed to do Aadhaar authentication to ensure that unscrupulous elements do not fake deceased farmers and misuse the FR's existing entry in respect of deceased farmer (those who become deceased after the FR is created and in respect of whom the legal heirs are not updated in RoR and hence also not updated in FR.)

- The use case should not limit itself to demo authentication but deploy facial Aadhaar authentication for potential beneficiaries

- Unified land API would include flag indicating whether mutation is in progress against a particular owner and extent of the land in transaction. This will help in bringing buyers (new owner) as farmers to provide benefits in case mutation is taking time.

- In case registration and land records system have been electronically integrated, then all transaction of registration department will be available to land records either immediately or by end of the day. While regular mutation system takes few days to go through workflow including notice period for raising objections, Unified land API would capture information against the owner whether any transaction has happened and if yes what is the area involved. This will help in bringing the new owner/buyer into FR because authentic information about transaction is received from land Records system. Assigning the transacted land extent to buyers is safe, as in majority of the cases seller will lose right on the transacted extent and mutation system is only to check whether buyer has right to acquired it or not.

Good practices at Field level

  To streamline the land bucket claiming process for farmers, the state Governments are implementing following measures

District and State master trainers

  Organize training sessions for Farmer Registry

  personnel by district and state master trainers.

  Target these sessions towards prominent farmers, Common Service Centers (CSCs), and panchayat officers.

Local Youth

  Involve educated local youth to assist farmers in claiming their land buckets using the Sahayak mobile application. Consider providing compensation for their services (subject to state decision).

 Information, Education,

  & Communication (IEC)

  Conduct IEC activities through various channels, including radio, newspapers, door­ to-door campaigns, loudspeakers, banners, etc., to educate farmers. Collaborate with village panchayats to ensure widespread outreach and awareness among farmers.

Farmer Registration Center

  Establish Farmer Registration centers in village panchayat buildings or enable COMMON SERVICE CENTRES (CSCs) and other frequented community areas to streamline the eKYC, land bucket claiming, consent, and e-signature process. These centers, equipped with necessary IT infrastructure and staffed by state government officials, will provide convenient locations for farmers to complete required procedures.

DM-SDM

  Level Monitoring

  It might be helpful for District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates to meet weekly to review the performance of the Farmer Registry in their areas. This could involve checking the number of farmers who have registered and been approved and identifying any potential issues.

Patwari Office Strengthening

  Provide Patwari offices with computers,

  internet access, and user credentials to access the Farmer Registry Portal. This will improve their efficiency in approving farmers' land bucket claims.

  Coordination Requirements between State and Centre

  Institutional structure at State level

  To sustain and manage Digital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture at the state level the state Government would need to conceive an institutional structure which will be empowered for all technical and administrative decision making. A tiered structure where strategic decision-making is done at the State level and operational implementation is done at District and below levels, is suggested as below. This may be customized as per the state's requirements

    - The farmer logs into the Farmer Registry portal using their Aadhaar ID.

2.  Submission of Land Claim Request:

    - The farmer enters the Land ID

    - If the land ID is already linked to a different individual, the system will flag it, and the farmer can proceed with raising a Land Claim Request.

    - The farmer provides relevant details, including land documents, ownership proof, or any supporting evidence to validate the claim.

3.  Claim Verification:

    - After submission, the claim request is forwarded to the designated Patwari or land officer responsible for the land records in that area.

    - The Patwari receives the land claim request along with all supporting documents provided by the farmer.

    - If the claim is valid, the Patwari updates the land records, and the farmer's Aadhaar is linked to the Land ID.

    - If the claim is invalid, the application is rejected, and the farmer is notified with an explanation for the rejection.

4.  Notification to Farmer:
