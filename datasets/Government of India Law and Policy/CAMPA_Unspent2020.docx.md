**Sub: Guidelines regarding unspent balance funds with States/UTs CAMPA Madam/Sir,**

I am directed to refer to this Ministry's letters No.11-100/2015-FC(Vol. III) dated 28th September, 2018, dated 5th April 2019 and dated 26th June, 2019 and letter No.4-64/2019-NA dated 1st October, 2019 on the above subject, allowing States/UTs to execute the new compensatory afforestation and maintenance of old plantations undertaken in previous years and nursery works as per APOs for the year 2018-19 initially and thereafter as per APOs for the year 2019-20; from the unspent fund available with States/UTs CAMPA until 31st March, 2020 ultimately, citing reasons mentioned in these letters.

2. The National Authority has already transferred the share of compensatory afforestation fund (CAF) to 29 States/UTs who have opened their Pubic Accounts (State Funds) as per the CAF Act, 2016 and these accounts are considered to be operational now. Hence, any unspent amount available with State Authorities as on 31st March, 2020 should have been transferred to the respective State Funds as per the Act.

3. Many States/UTs have again requested to extend the window for utilisation of the unspent amount available with them until 31st March, 2021\. Some of these States/UTs have genuine concerns as corona virus pandemic had adversely affected the completion of ongoing work as well as payments during 2019-20.

4. This matter has also been discussed in the 5th and 6th meetings of the Executive Committee of the National Authority.

5. Rather than giving general approval, the Competent Authority has allowed the extension of time for using unspent fund of Ad-hoc CAMPA until 31.03.2021 for works approved per APO (2019-21) as under:

   1. items for which work got started during 2019-20, but could not be completed during 2019-20 and are planned to be completed within 2020-21;

   2. payment of committed liabilities of work done in 2019-20;

   3. no fresh work (as per APO for 2020-21) will be taken up from unspent balance; and  
   4. all balance fund as on 31.03.2021 shall be deposited in the State Fund forthwith, and the fund received from Ad-hoc CAMPA shall be audited within

   the next six months for onward submission to National Authority.

6. The States/UTs, which do not fit into the above category, shall deposit the unspent balance along with interest in the State Fund by the end of July 2020 and get the fund audited by December, 2020 for onward submission to National Authority.

7. This is being issued with the approval of the Hon’ble Minister, Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

Yours faithfully
