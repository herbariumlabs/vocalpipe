  Subject: Setting up of State and District Level Grievance Redressal Monitoring Committees under the Pradhan Mantri Klsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme - regarding

  Madam/ Sir,

  As you are aware, the new Central Sector Scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Klsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme, seeking to provide income support to all Small and Marginal landholder farmers' families with cultivable land holding upto 2 hectare across the country, by way of payment of Rs.GOOD/- per year, subject to certain exclusions, has been launched on the 24^(th) February, 2019. The amount is being directly credited into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries held in destination banks, through Direct Benefit Transfer.

2.  As per the Operational Guidelines of the Scheme, para 5.2 thereof, as reproduced below, the State / UT Governments are required to notify / set up State and District Level Grievance Redressal Monitoring Committees under the PM-KISAN Scheme:

  "5. Review, Monitoring and Grievance Redressal Mechanism

  5.2 The States shall also notify State and District Level Grievance Redressal Monitoring Committees for looking into all the grievances related to implementation of the scheme. Any grievances or complaints which are received should be disposed off on merit preferably within two weeks time.11

3.  Since launching of the Scheme, this Department has continuously been receiving numerous telephonic complaints / queries from the aggrieved farmers relating to registration of their names in the beneficiaries' lists uner the scheme. The complaints /queries are about inter alia the location of registration centres, registration in cases of non-updated landrecords, correction of errors in the data submitted to the registering agencies, registering agencies not accepting further applications saying that the last date is over, etc.

[]

.... '2 --

4.  As per the provisions of para 4.1 of the Operational Guidelines, the responsibility of identifying and preparing the database of eligible beneficiary landholder farmers' families shall be of the State/UT Governments. This Department is, therefore, unable to resolve / satisfy those complaints / queries of the farmers which fall within the purview of the State / UT Governments.

5.  In view of the above, you are requested to urgently set up the requisite grievance redressal mechanism in the State / UT at various levels for hearing and redressing the grievances of the farmers under the scheme and also notify the name, designation, address, telephone number, e-mail id, etc of the concerned Grievance Officers prominently in your respective State/UT's vernacular as well as Hindi and English newspapers and electronic media.

6.  It must be made clear to the registering agencies that there is no last date for registration/ accepting appications from the eligible farmers under the scheme.

Yours sincerely,

  Joint Secretary & CEO (PM-KISAN)
