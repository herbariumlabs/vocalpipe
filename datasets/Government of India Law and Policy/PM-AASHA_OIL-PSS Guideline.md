  CHAPTER-I

  INTRODUCTION

  Assurance of a remunerative and stable price environment for growers/farmers is very important for increasing agricultural production and productivity. The market price for agricultural produce many times tends to be unstable and volatile which may result in undue losses to the growers and discourage adoption of the modern technology and required inputs.

  The Government's price policy for agricultural commodities seeks to ensure remunerative prices to the growers for their produce with a view to encourage higher investment and production and to safeguard the interest of consumers by making available supplies at reasonable prices with low cost of intermediation. The price policy also seeks to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure in the perspective of the overall needs of the economy.

  Towards this end, the Government announces Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 25 major agricultural commodities each year in Kharif and Rabi Crop seasons after taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). CACP recommends MSP for twenty two (22) crops and Fair & Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane. Apart from Sugarcane fo_rwhich FRP is declared. by the Department of Food. &Public Distribution, twenty two crops covered under MSP are Paddy, Jowar, Bajra, Maize, Ragi, Arhar, Moong, Urad, Groundnut-in-shell, Soyabean, Sunflower, Seasamum, Nigerseed, Cotton, Wheat, Barley, Gram, Masur (lentil), Rapeseed/Mustard seed, Safflower, Jute and Copra. In addition to this, MSP for Toria and De-Husked coconut is fixed by the Department on the basis of MSP's of Rapeseed/Mustard seed and Copra respectively.

  The Government organize procurement operations of MSP notified agricultural commodities through various public agencies such as Food Corporation of India (FCI), Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), Jute Corporation of India (JCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC), and cooperative and other agencies such as National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation(NAFED), National Consumer Cooperative Federation(NCCF), and Small Farmers Agri. Business Consortium(SFAC). Besides, State Governments also appoint state agencies to undertake PSS operations.

  The Government of India has recently decided to implement a new Umbrella scheme "Pradhan Mantri -Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan" (PM AASHA). Under PM-AASHA, the procurement of Pulses and Copra shall be done under Price Support Scheme and for oilseeds

' ..

  states /UT governments will be offered a bouquet of Price Deficiency Payment Scheme ( POPS) and Price Support Scheme , with the flexibility to choose either of them in a given marketing season for particular oilseeds for the entire State/UT . Further , for oilseeds, States/ UTs will have option to rollout a pilot of Private Procurement & Stockiest Scheme (PPSS) in selected district/APMCs of district involving participation of private stockiest. PSS, POPS and Pilot PPSS will be implemented by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare. For other MSP notified crops like Wheat, Paddy and other cereals including nutri cereals existing scheme of Department of Food & Public Distribution and for Cotton and Jute scheme of Ministry of Textile will be continued to be implemented.

  REASONS FOR AMENDING THE PSS GUIDELINES

  The PSS Guidelines were first compiled in May 2014. Requests and suggestions for suitable revision/amendment in the PSS guidelines were being received from State Governments. Accordingly the suggestions were examined and suitable amendments have been incorporated in the existing PSS guidelines. The new PSS guidelines under the umbrella scheme "PM AASHA" will be effective from Kharif Marketing Season 2018-19.

Biological life referred to as Future Expiry Date (FED) in the parlance of commodity exchange, is the life of the commodity after which it must be re- assessed/ consumed in order to remain fit for human consumption. Further, while holding the stock, the seasonality/durability of that particular crop will also be kept in mind. However, in exceptional circumstances, requiring stocking over nine months, prior approval of the DAC & FW should be obtained.
