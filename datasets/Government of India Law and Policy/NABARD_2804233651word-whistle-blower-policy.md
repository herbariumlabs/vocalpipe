NABARD Whistle Blower Policy

PREAMBLE

  Government of India, Department of Personnel and Training, published a Resolution dated 21st April, 2004, on the Public Interest Disclosure & Protection of Informers (PIDPI) and issued guidelines thereon authorizing the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) as the Designated Agency to receive written complaints for disclosure on any allegation of corruption for misuse of office from any public servant or a person including an NGO and recommend appropriate action. In accordance with this Resolution, the CVC has formulated norms for acceptance of complaints under the PIDPI Resolution and for keeping the identity of the complainant secret.

  NABARD, being established under a Central Act comes under the purview of the CVC, has decided to introduce a Whistle Blower Policy as a measure of enhancing Corporate Governance. In addition to the Central Government’s PIDPI Resolution, this Policy intends to provide employees of the Bank another window for preferring complaints and making disclosures on any allegation of misuse of office or of corrupt practices, without fear of victimisation and retribution.

OBJECTIVE

  The objective of the ‘Whistle Blower Policy' is to ensure the highest ethical, moral and business standards in the course of functioning and to build a lasting and strong culture of Corporate Governance within the Bank. In terms of the Policy, an internal mechanism is established for staff members to report to the management concerns about unethical behaviour, actual or suspected fraud or violation of the Bank's code of conduct/NABARD Staff Rules 1982. The Policy is intended to encourage all employees of the Bank to report suspected or actual occurrence of illegal, unethical or inappropriate actions, behaviours or practices by staff without fear of retribution. Employees can voice their concerns on irregularities, malpractices and other misdemeanours with due safeguard and protection to the whistle blower.

  This policy should be read in conjunction with existing instructions of the Bank as well as those of the Government of India/Central Vigilance Commission in this matter, issued from time to time.
