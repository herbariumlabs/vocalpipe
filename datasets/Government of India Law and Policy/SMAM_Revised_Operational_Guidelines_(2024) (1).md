Procedure for Credit Linked Capital Subsidy

  The following is the gist of procedure to be followed:

1.  Advance Subsidy: The 50% eligible subsidy amount for the projects will be released as advance by the Implementing Agencies to the participating Financial Institutions (Banks) on submission of project scrutiny note cum claim form as per requirement and the norms of the interventions. The same would be kept in a Subsidy Reserve Fund Account of the concerned borrowers, to be adjusted finally against loan amount of the bank towards the end of the repayment period and life of the project as per the time schedule.

2.  Final Installment of Subsidy: the remaining 50% would be disbursed to the participating Banks by the Implementing Agencies after conduct of an inspection and physical verification of the machines and equipments by the State Level Project Sanctioning Committee and officials from the financing banks.

3.  Adjustment of Subsidy to Borrower's Account: The subsidy released to the bank for individual project will be kept in a separate borrower-wise account. The adjustment of subsidy will be back ended. Accordingly, the full project cost including the subsidy amount, but excluding the margin money contribution from the beneficiary, would be disbursed as a loan by the Banks. The repayment schedule will be drawn on the loan amount in such a way that the total subsidy amount is adjusted after the full bank loan component with interest is liquidated.

4.  Utilization Certificate: After release of final installment of subsidy, a Utilization Certificate is required to be submitted by the financing Bank certifying that the full amount of subsidy received in respect of the project has been fully utilized (by way of crediting to the "Subsidy Reserve Fund Account- Borrower - wise") and adjusted in the books of Account under the sanctioned terms and conditions of the project within overall guidelines of the scheme.

5.  No Interest is chargeable on Subsidy Portion: For the purpose of charging interest on the loan component, the subsidy amount would be excluded. The balance lying to the credit of the subsidy reserve fund account will not form part of demand and time liabilities for the purpose of SLR/ CRR

Institutional Lending:

(a) Eligible Financial Institutions: The eligible financing institutions under the scheme may be (i) Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), State Cooperative Banks (SCBs), State Cooperative Agricultural and Rural Development Banks (SCARDBs), Scheduled Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (PUCBs), Agricultural Development Finance Companies (ADFCs) and such other institutions (ii) Cooperatives where they seek loan from National Cooperatives Development Corporation (NCDC).

Term Loan

  For the projects, the amount as eligible as capital subsidy of the project cost can be raised as term loan from the financing banks. The repayment schedule will be drawn on the total loan amount (including subsidy) in such a way that the subsidy amount is adjusted after liquidation of the net bank loan (excluding subsidy). The financial institution may provide working capital separately for undertaking the business by the entrepreneurs.

(c) Rate of interest and Scale of Financing to the ultimate borrower : As decided by the financing bank, as per their respective Board approved policy.

(d) Security: The security will be as per norms prescribed by RBI from time to time.

(e) Repayment Period: Repayment period will depend upon the cash flow and may be generally up to 5 years with a grace of one year.

7.  Procedure to be followed for sanctioning of project and release of subsidy

    (a) Interested beneficiaries will submit the project proposal for term loan and subsidy to Bank on application form as prescribed by the concerned bank along with project report and other documents for appraisal and sanction of loan.

    (b) Bank after appraisal and scrutiny of loan application will furnish a brief project profile-cum-claim form for advance subsidy in the prescribed format as may be devised by the project sanctioning committee at the State level. The loan shall be disbursed by the Bank only after the project has been cleared and approved by the State level project sanctioning committee, which shall also have a representative of the concerned Bank.

    (c) The Implementing Agencies on the recommendation of State level project sanctioning committee shall release 50% of the eligible amount of subsidy as advance subsidy to the participating bank for keeping the same in the subsidy fund account (borrower-wise)

    (d) The participating bank shall provide eligible amount of subsidy as term loan to the beneficiary. The banks at their discretion may extend full project cost as term loan to the beneficiary.

    (e) The beneficiary will inform the Bank that the required machines and equipments have been acquired by the beneficiary and the State level project sanctioning committee involving the bank official shall conduct the physical verification of the machines and equipments. After inspection the Bank will submit the claim form to the Implementing Agencies for final

  []subsidy. The claim form shall necessarily be enclosed with inspection report of the committee. The Implementing Agency shall release the final subsidy to banks which will be adjusted against the subsidy amount provided to the banks in advance.

(f) Monitoring of each project will be done by Banks branches and district level officers of the Implementing Agencies with periodic reporting to the Implementing Agency.
