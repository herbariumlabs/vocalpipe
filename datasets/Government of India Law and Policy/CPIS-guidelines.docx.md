# **Coconut Palm Insurance Scheme**

1. # **Introduction**

Coconut cultivation subjected to risks from climatic changes, natural disasters, pests, diseases etc. and, at times, entire coconut cultivation of a region, gets wiped out due to natural calamity or onset of pest attack. Coconut is a perennial crop and losses suffered by farmers due to damage of this crop, are material and needs to be addressed. Coconut palms are perennial crops, but palm trees are characterized by periodic system of crop setting and outcomes and hence resemble seasonal annual crops and should, accordingly, eligible for insurance cover. Since coconut is cultivated under rain-fed management and is susceptible to biotic and a-biotic stresses, it is necessary to minimize risk faced by coconut farmers, predominantly small and marginal, by covering coconut palms with an insurance scheme.
