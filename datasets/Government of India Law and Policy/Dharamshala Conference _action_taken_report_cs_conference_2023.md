  Action Taken Report on Dharamshala Conference

  (1st CS Conference)

  I

I.  DISTRICT AND CROP WISE PLANS ON AGRO CLIMATIC ZONES

  The State is divided into six agro climatic zones as follows

1.  North Bank Plains: Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Sonitpur Darrang Districts

2.  Upper Brahmaputra Valley: Golaghat, Jorhat, Sivasagar, Dibrugarh & Tinsukia Dists

3.  Central Brahmaputra Valley: Nagaon &MorigaonDists

4.  lower Brahmaputra Valley: Dhubri, Kokrajhar, Bongaigaon, Chirrang, Goalpara, Barpeta, Nalbari, Baksa and Kamrup Dists

5.  Barak Valley: Cachar, Karimganj and HailakandiDists

6.  Hill Zone: Karbi Anglong& North Cachar (Dima HasaoJ

  Currently, the farmers of the State follow a mixed cropping pattern. There are numbers of challenges associated with the cropping pattern in Assam. These relate to:

1.  Large tracts of farmland under mono-cropping

2.  Huge area under rice fallows (around 10 lakh ha)

3.  Poor crop planning and delivery of extension services as per agro climatic zones

  To address the above, Government of Assam (GoA) has taken a number of initiatives which are enumerated below:

1.  Crop diversification:

    a)  Assam Millets Mission (AMM): In line with the adoption of India sponsored resolution, 2023 is being celebrated as international year of Millets by United Nations. The State Govt has already taken advance steps and set up Assam Millets Mission (AMM) for a period of seven years from 2022-23 to 2028-29 with total outlay of Rs 200 Cr. The key activities under the Mission include: (i) Market and nutrition supportive production (ii) post­ harvest& value addition side aspects (iii) Market linkages (iv) Better nutrition, healthy &disease-free Assam through millets. This is being integrated with Poshan Abhiyan and the Mid day meal scheme to ensure adoption of these Nutri-cereals in the diet of school going and pre-school children as well as pregnant mothers. For the first four years, the target is to bring around 20,000 ha area under millets cultivation and increase productivity from 600 Kg per ha to 1200 Kg per ha.

    b)  Assam Fodder Mission: The State Govt has set up Assam Fodder Mission (AFM) for a period of seven years from 2022-23 to 2028-29 with an outlay of Rs 120 Cr. The key activities under the Mission include: (i) Fodder seed production & distribution (ii) Fodder production demonstrations (iii) Post harvest management & mechanization (iv) Awareness generation, training & capacity building. The annual requirement of green folder in the state is around 23 Iakh metric ton but only 85,000 metric ton is produced in the state. Thus, there is a deficit of around 22 lakh metric tons. In the first four years i.e., upto 2026, the target is to bring around 22,000 ha under fodder cultivation.

    c)  Protected cultivation: Protected cultivation of high value horticulture crops and exotic

  crops is another potential area towards exponential increase in farm income. Currently, the

  []

area under protected cultivation is only 162 ha which will be scaled up to 350 ha by 2026.

  I d) Oil palm cultivation (NMEO-OP): The GOI has identified 3.75 Iakh ha area potential for oil

  II palm cultivation and set a target of 2 lakh Ha area to be covered under oil palm cultivation till 2025-26.

  The GOI has approved 18 districts for implementation of the scheme and accordingly the districts have been divided into six zones for oil palm cultivation.2084 ha area has already been brought under oil palm cultivation.

  Four Nurseries have been set up through four FPCs. Three zones have already been allotted to Four processors (Patanjali Foods, Godrej Agrovet, K E Cultivation Pvt Ltd and 3F Oil Palm Ltd).

  19 Nurseries have been setup by the processor companies for production of Oil­ palm seedlings.

  20.65 Lakh sprouts have been sown, and these seedlings will be ready for plantation in farmers field from February 2024 onwards.

  200 ha area have been planted under NMEO-OP till date.

  Exposure visits for farmers to oil palm growing states are being carried out Land acquired for one Processing unit at Dhing, Nagaon by Patanjali Foods Ltd

  e) Natural farming : NF inputs like Jivamrut, Ghana Jivamrut, Beejamrit, Acchadan, zero tillage etc. are gaining popularity among NF practitioners

2.  Utilization of rice fallow areas for other crops: It is estimated that the State has around 10 lakh ha of rice fallow area which is left unutilized by farmers after taking up rice in Kharif/ Sali rice. It is also estimated that out of this 10-lakh ha area, around 6 Iakh ha area has either irrigation availability or residual moisture availability. To utilize this area, the Govt is taking up the following initiatives:

a.  Mustard area expansion: Currently, the area under mustard- cultivation is only 2.87 lakh ha and production are 1.85 lakh metric tons which is sufficient to meet 20% of the State's mustard edible oil requirement. Additional 4 lakh hectare area clubbed with high yielding varieties, scientific package of practices and technical support of ICAR-DRMR will be broug t under mustard in next 4 years. This will produce around additional 6 Iakh metric ton of mustard which can meet the remaining 80% of the State's edible oil requirement and help in achieving self-sufficiency in mustard oil.

b.  Pulses area expansion: Similarly, current pulses area is only about 1.42 lakh hectares and production is 1.09 lakh metric tons. To meet the State's demand, additional 3 lakh hectare area is planned to be brought under pulses cultivation in the next four years. Area expansion along with productivity enhancement through high yielding varieties and scientific package of practices, the total production is expected to go up to 3.5 lakh metric tons which can meet the State's requirement through in-house production.

c.  Maize area expansion: Maize is an ingredient of animal feed, poultry feed and also used in silage making. The current area under maize cultivation in the state is 45,000 hectares (and production is around 1 lakh metric ton) which is planned to be expanded to 2.7 lakh hectares in next four years. This will be supplemented by high yielding hybrids and technical support of Indian Institute of Maize Research (IIMR). The targeted production

[]

  after four years is about 7.3 lakh metric tons which will largely feed into State's silage making requirements and also ethanol production (new projects).

d.  Potato area expansion: Current potato area in the state is around one lakh hectare &

  production is around 7.50 lakh MT. Additional 3 Iakh hectare area is planned to be brought under potato cultivation to be accommodated through introduction of short and medium duration rice varieties in Sali season. The targeted production is around 30 lakh metric ton after four years. These efforts are being supported by International Potato Center under APART for next two years.

DIGITAL AGRICULTURE-AGRISTACK

  Interventions in digital agriculture under Agri stack comprises of the three basic building blocks:

a)  Farmers' database- dynamically linked to their plots and list of all farmers along with Aadhaar

b)  Geo referenced plots

c)  Real-time digital crop survey

  Present Status of Digital Agriculture under Agri stackin Assam:

- The State Government has formed two committees, namely Steering and Implementation committee.

- The State of Assam has signed a MoU with Government of India on 'Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)for Agriculture'-

  i.  in the initial phase of under this initiative, it will involve creation or upgradation of the three core registries namely, Farmer Registry, Geo-Referenced Village Maps and Crop Sown/Grown Registry at the State Level and the synchronization of selected data from the three State Registries to the Centre by following a strict data federation model between the Centre and the States.

  ii. The States and its farmers would benefit from DPI and the use of JCT in Agriculture in many ways including the followings:

      1.  Optimizing Agricultural Scheme budgets

      2.  Getting better & quicker access.to Central and State Govt. schemes.

      3.  Enabling farmers to access agricultural services digitally.

- Assam has been selected as one of the 12 States for the Pilot Digital Crop Survey (DCS) towards creation of Crop Sown/Grown registry in India.

- Presently Pilot DCS is underway in 11 selected Revenue Circles (RC) of 7 Districts: Morigaon(a/1 5 RC}, Charaideo(Sapekhati}, Nagaon (Nagaon Sadar), Karimganj(R.K Nagar), Biswanath (Gohpur), Darrang{Pathorighat)&Bongaigaon(Boitamari).

- Gol allocated fund for the Pilot DCS@ 1.43 Cr. Under NeGP-A in 90:10 pattern.

- Pilot DCS started in Mid-September 2023 with an aim to complete by 31stOctober 2023, i.e., 15 days grace period added. However, DCS needs to be completed prior to harvesting of crops in the field.

- Digital Crop Survey is being conducted by Local Village youth@ Rs, 20/- per survey no.

- Delayed the start in many RCs due to time taken in resolving mismatches in Revenue

  Maps in its Geo-references and LGD mappings.

TARGETTED EDIBLE OIL PRODUCTION

  Two edible oil crops are grown in Assam i.e. (t)Mustard &Toria and (2) Oil palm. The Government • of Assam is taking up a massive mustard area expansion program on rice fallows and so also extensive program on oil palm cultivation. The details are provided below:

1.  Massive mustard area expansion program: The total edible oil requirement (largely mustard oil) of the State is around 2 lakh MT. But the State is highly deficit in edible oil. The current mustard and Toria production (2.87 lakh ha, 1.85 lakh MT production) can meet only 20% of the State's edible oil requirement (around 60,000 MT). Rest of the edible oil requirement is sourced from outside. To address this situation, the State has embarked on a massive mustard area expansion program over four years. The year-wise additional rice fallow area to be brought under mustard cultivation is provided below:

  2022-23: 50,000 ha

  2023-24: 1,50,000 ha

  2024-25: 2,00,000 ha

  Total: 4,00,000 ha

National Mission ofEdible Oils- Oil Palm:

a.  GOl launched a Centrally·sponsored scheme- National Mission on Edible Oils-Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) in September 2021 to minimize the import burdens.

b.  GOI has approved 18 districts of Assam for implementation of the scheme and set a target of covering 2 lakh ha under Oil Palm cultivation by 2025-26.

c.  Productive bearing of Oil Palm trees starts from 4th Year.

d.  Production of Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) - the raw material for extracting Palm Oil is 20-25 MT/Ha. Per ha production of Palm Oil is 4-5 MT.

e.  Experienced Oil Palm companies are being empaneled for the implementation of the scheme.

f.  There is a scarcity of seedlings, as the seeds (Sprouts) are to be imported from other countries like Malaysia, Thailand, etc.

g.  Empaneled companies have started establishment of Nurseries to ensure seedling availability.

h.  The GOI has approved establishment of 6 Oil palm Processing mills to ensure Buy

  back and sustainability.

i.  The year-wise target for Oil Palm area expansion is-

    i.  2021-22: 1500 ha

    ii. 2022-23: 2500 Ha

    iii. 2023-24: 86000 Hc:i

iv. 2024-25: 100000 Ha

v.  2025-26: 10000 Ha

TARGETTED PULSES PRODUCTION

  Current pulses area is only about 1.42 lakh hectares and production are 1.09 lakh metric tons. To

  meet the State's demand, additional 3 lakh hectare area is planned to be brought under pulses cultivation in the next four years. Area expansion along with productivity enhancement through high yielding varieties and scientific package of practices, the total production is expected to go up to 3.5 lakh metric tons which can meet the State's requirement through in-house production. The year wise targets for additional pulses area are provided below:

i.  2022-23: 75,000 Ha

ii. 2023-24: 75,000 Ha

iii. 2024-25: 75,000 Ha

iv. 2025-26: 75,000 Ha

Total: 3,00,000 ha

  For the year 2022-23 around 75,000 ha area has already been identified for cultivation of black gram and green gram (sowing in Feb 2023).

CREATION & UTILIZATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DISEASE FREE PLANTING MATERIAL

  A Seed Vertical has been set up under the World Bank financed Assam Agribusiness and Rural Transformation Project (APART). The key activities in the seed vertical are foundation seed production on the seed farms of ASCL and Directorate of Agriculture.(recently around 40 seed farms of Directorate of Agriculture have been handed over to ASCL through an agreement for better and focused utilization of these land resources), certified seed production with the Farmer Producer Companies, strengthening of ASCL, Assam Seed and Organ'ic Certification Agency, Seed Science wing of Assam Agricultural University, training & capacity building etc.

  Currently foundation seed production is going on in paddy (120 ha) '(harvesting stage), Toria (42 ha), lentil (15 ha) and paddy certified seed production is ongoing with 15 FPCs covering an area of around 550 ha. Similarly, certified seed production in Black gram is ongoing with two FPCs in 40 ha area. Also mustard/ Toria is certified seed production ongoing with two FPCs in 75 ha area. These seeds will buy back by ASCL and supplied to farmers in various Govt schemes as per requirement placed by Directorate of Agriculture. This would meet a part of State's seed requirement through in house production.
