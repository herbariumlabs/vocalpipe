Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER)

Background

  Realizing the potential of organic farming in the North Eastern Region of the country Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare launched a Central Sector Scheme, now a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (with 100% GoI share), titled “Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER)” for implementation in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura, during the 12th plan period with an allocation of ₹ 400 crore. The scheme aimed at the development of certified organic production in value chain mode to link growers with consumers and to support the development of the entire value chain starting from inputs, seeds, and certification, to the creation of facilities for collection, aggregation, processing marketing, and brand building initiatives.

  Since the scheme was in value chain mode, it has been able to create concentrated production clusters of specific commodities with necessary postharvest infrastructure and market linkages. All these clusters were targeted for export focus crops and certified under National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) which is a third-party certification process.

  Three phases of MOVCDNER have been concluded covering 1.79 lakh ha and 379 FPOs. The phase IV of the scheme will cover an additional 50,000 ha and 100 FPOs.

Objectives

  The mission aims at development of crop commodity specific organic value chain and address gaps in organic crop production, wild crop harvesting, organic livestock management and processing handling and marketing of organic agricultural products in north eastern states through:

i.  Developing crop specific organic production clusters with necessary infrastructural, technical and financial support.

ii. Facilitating partnership between farmers and organic businesses: Local enterprises and / or Farmer Producer Companies based on back-to-back long- term trade relations with clients in domestic and export markets.

iii. Providing enabling environment for project initiatives and development programs with necessary support for organic value chain development and create market access.

iv. Empowering producers with program ownership by organizing them into FIGs with the final aim to federate into farmer producer organizations/ companies.

v.  Replacing conventional farming/subsistence farming system into local resource based, self-sustainable, high value commercial organic enterprise.

vi. Providing training and consistent support to farmers on organic farming methods at farmer, FIG and FPO levels to enhance the quality and productivity while facilitating market access for improved price realisation.

vii. Developing commodity specific commercial organic value chain under integrated and concentrated approach with end-to-end facilities for production, processing, storage and marketing.

viii. Creating organic parks/zones that come equipped with facilities that support collection, aggregation, value addition, processing, storage, and market- linkages for specific commodities that require high-end technological investment.

ix. Develop NER products as brands/labels through brand building and facilitating stronger marketing access under the ownership of growers’ organizations/ companies.

x.  Creating state specific lead agency (Organic Commodity Board or Organic Mission) for coordinating, monitoring, supporting and financing the development and operationalization of entire value chain.

SLAs and SPs shall ensure full disclosure of documents required for these evaluations.

x.  States should take up third-party based concurrent, mid-term and final evaluations from time to time.

General Guidance

  As MOVCDNER is a program where farmers are supported for the transformation of conventional agriculture to organic with quality assurance and market linkages alongside end-to-end value chain infrastructure, there is a need for a well-defined institutional network at the state level for effective implementation and continuous handholding. Farmers under such a strategy will be clubbed into clusters of FIGs of 20 ha each and then 25 FIGs in a block or district to be aggregated into FPOs. However, Chairperson of DLMCs may propose smaller FPOs by providing necessary justification and approval by SLEC. The following minimum requirements should be ensured:

i.  A dedicated MOVCDNER Mission office with devoted staff and an officer in charge is to be created for effective implementation, evaluation, and monitoring at the state level.

ii. Clusters and groups of clusters to be developed in the concentrated mode as far as possible in the nearby and contiguous areas in a village or nearby group of villages.

iii. Only willing farmers to be enrolled and efforts should be made to cover the entire landholding of participating farmers. Benefits under the scheme will be restricted to a maximum of 2 ha per farmer.

iv. States should ensure the convergence of MOVCDNER with various other Government programmes from DA&FW and other ministries like NRLM and NREGS of the Ministry of Rural Development, PM Kisan Sampada Yojana of the Ministry of Food Processing and any other related schemes of GoI.

v.  The farmers should commit to sell their produce through the FPOs and register transactions in the FPOs accounts. This includes transactions with local middlemen. Frequent transactions in the FPOs account builds up a balance sheet which enables credit worthiness.

vi. Hiring of SPs should be done by a committee chaired by Commissioner (Agriculture/Horticulture) or Secretary (Agriculture/Horticulture) of the respective states, with the Mission Director of SLA as convener. General procurement procedures prevailing in the state should be followed to select the credible SPs.

vii. While selecting service providers, SLA should ensure that those potential SPs who are in the business of organic or chemical input manufacturing, distribution or sales should give an undertaking stating that their products will not be sold in the respective state. It should also be ensured that no service provider should be given more that 50% of the total area/ FPOs allocated to the state in that phase. Regular feedback and appraisal of SPs should be collected and SPs not performing satisfactorily should not be allowed to implement the scheme.

viii. All farmers mobilized/enrolled under the scheme should also be enrolled in Soil Health Card Scheme.

9.  Components

    1.  Value Chain Institutional Development

        1.  Formation of FPOs

  Crop/commodity-specific production clusters will be developed in a concentrated mode for ease in training, handholding, certification, and collection and aggregation. Farmers can be grouped into FIGs at the village level and transformed into FPOs/FPCs. The SLAs may empanel Service Providers for FPO formation, capacity building and handholding. The FPOs will be formed based on cost norms and activities described in earlier guidelines and local situations as decided by SLA.

  If the SLAs assess that there are already adequate number of FPCs formed and decides not to have more FPO/FPCs, then in such case new farmers/ FIGs can be added to the existing FPO/FPCs.

  Efforts should be made to create commodity-specific clusters, where a minimum of 60% area is cropped with targeted commodity. New FPCs may be made only when the clusters are developed in new areas where there are no FPCs. Even existing FPCs in that area may be approached to include FIGs under the scheme. The funding requirements will be examined in case to case basis based on the proposal from the states, as approved by SLEC.

  FPOs formed under 10,000 FPOs scheme willing to adopt organic farming may also be supported for conversion into Organic and with necessary infrastructure (without funding for FPO formation). In such cases, the SLA should ensure that the area is contiguous and organized into clusters.

Training, handholding, ICS management, documentation, and certification of crop production through SPs

  A budget provision of ₹ 10,000 per ha for three years has been made for hiring the services of competent SPs for providing training, handholding, ICS management, documentation and organic certification through the third-party system under NPOP. SPs must ensure that ICS personnel or Local Resource Persons (LRPs) are hired only from among the participating farmers/ local SRLM group/member FPO/FPCs so that the activity can continue even after the contract conclusion of service providing agency. It should also be ensured that for every 75 farmers, one LRP is deployed to coordinate trainings, meetings, data collection and monitoring. In FPOs, where lower number of FIGs are present, lesser number of LRPs may be deployed, subject to approval of DLMC.

  LRPs will have the following roles and responsibilities:

i.  Visit each farm once every month to monitor farm activities and understand challenges faced by the farmers.

ii. FIG level meetings every week to train farmers, interact and understand challenges faced by farmers, FPO functioning and marketing activities and maintain farmer diary. Each farmer should maintain at least 75% attendance in such meetings.

iii. Weekly trainings/ farm demonstrations to farmers at FIG level and provide solutions for challenges faced by farmers, to build a strong connect of farmers to FIGs and ultimately to the FPO.

iv. Register farmers on Krishi Mapper & provide regular updates on the MOVCDNER IT Portal.

v.  Facilitate collection of Aadhaar Authenticated Bank Accounts

  The states may choose to engage services of ATMA, ICAR, KVKs, SAUs, CAUs, NCONF or any other government institution for the training of farmers on organic farming and on-farm and off-farm input application based on their competencies & divide the budget for training accordingly, between the SPs and these government agencies as per the guidelines.

  All documents for ICS management, training, transactions and other FPO activities should be maintained at the office of the FPO. In addition, the coordinator of the Service Provider should also operate from the office of the FPO for effective coordination.

  The SLAs may engage the support from Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) to handhold FPOs towards compliance with exports.

Value Chain Production

1.  Incentive to farmers for on-farm and off-farm inputs – A sum of ₹. 15,000 has been provided for assistance to farmers for on-farm input production infrastructure and off-farm inputs. The amount shall be provided to farmers as a Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) in their Aadhaar Authenticated Bank Accounts through Aadhaar Enabled Payment System. The funds shall be released in two instalments each year for three years. The second instalment should be released to the farmer only after ascertaining that the farmer has become a member of the FPO and has deposited his/her share capital, as decided by the states. The funds provided as DBT should be used by the farmers for developing on-farm input production infrastructure, such as vermicompost beds, and for off-farm inputs such as neem oil, cakes, bio- fertilizers, waste decomposers, etc.

2.  Value Chain seed and planting material – To ensure quality and varietal uniformity, registered farmers will be provided with quality seed/ planting

  material. Assistance for quality seed/ planting material will be limited to 50% of planting material cost based on the prevailing cost norms in MIDH for horticulture crops and 50% on actuals for agricultural crops.

  For effective implementation, SLA should engage with ICAR institutions (CAU, SAU, KVKs, etc.), SRLMs, PACS, government farms, FPOs formed in previous phases and empanelled/ accredited nurseries to source disease- free high-quality planting material. The states should also enable the FPOs developed in the current phase to produce their seeds through organised seed clusters. Sufficient planning to place orders by FPO should be done to ensure timely distribution of planting materials, preferably one year before the sowing or planting season.

3.  Custom Hiring Centres (CHC) - To facilitate the creation of an input facilitation service centre and agri-machinery custom hiring centre at commodity cluster / FPC level a sum of ₹. 10.00 lakh per Custom Hiring Centre (or prevailing cost norms for Farm Machinery Bank for Custom Hiring in SMAM) is provisioned. States should allocate at least on CHC to each FPO being formed. These facilities shall provide need-based agriculture machinery, implements or any other equipment needed by the farmers under the ownership of each FPO/FPC. Facilities created may depend upon the crop and activities being undertaken. If there are requirements for additional CHCs, the SLA may facilitate the same through Sub-Mission for Agriculture Mechanisation and part of subsidy can be covered under MOVCDNER, as per the approved AAP by DA&FW.

Value Chain Primary Post-harvest

  Each FPO will be provided with the following basic minimum postharvest handling infrastructure to ensure that primary postharvest and handling facilities are available. FPOs formed in previous phases may also be supported under this component who have a “Excellent” performance record, ascertained using the FPO grading tool, issued from time to time. The facilities may also be extended to Cluster Level Federation (consisting of farmers and practicing organic farming), developed under SRLM, at par with FPOs so they can also play an active role in the value chain

1.  Seed stores/ warehouses/small cold store – Each FPO will be supported in setting up a seed store/ warehouse/ cold store as per their requirement for storage and pre-shipment. Assistance will be capped @ 75%, maximum of ₹

  7.5 lakhs (75% assistance or ₹ 7.5 lakhs against TFO of ₹ 10 lakhs). Smaller units may also be sanctioned to the FPOs subject to the overall budget head in the guidelines.

2.  Collection and aggregation centre - Each FPO will be supported in setting up a collection and aggregation centre with basic facilities for cleaning, grading and packing. Assistance will be capped @ 75%, maximum of ₹ 11.25 lakhs (75% assistance or ₹ 11.25 lakhs against TFO of ₹ 15.00 lakhs). Smaller units

  may also be sanctioned to the FPOs subject to the overall budget head in the guidelines.

3.  Transport vehicle of 2 MT capacity - Each FPO will be supported for procurement of a commercial transport vehicle of a two MT capacity. Assistance will be capped @ 75%, maximum of ₹ 7.5 lakhs (75% assistance or 7.50 lakh against TFO of ₹ 10.00 lakh). Smaller units may also be sanctioned to the FPOs subject to the overall budget head in the guidelines.

Postharvest Value Addition and Processing Infrastructure Development

  North Eastern States being constrained by higher costs of transportation, the commercial produce must be subjected to some value addition and processing for reducing the bulk volume and for increasing the value. Therefore, provisions are being made in the scheme for financial assistance for setting up of necessary processing infrastructure. The value addition and processing infrastructure can be set up either by FPO/FPCs or by private entrepreneurs/ companies, Govt agencies, or Joint ventures with or without state Government as partners. Financial assistance will be provided @ 75% to FPO/FPCs and Cluster Level Federations and 50% to private entities/ Govt agencies or Joint Ventures. Any proposed unit that has already availed subsidy from any other state or central government department/ agency shall not be considered eligible under the scheme. FPOs formed in previous phases may also be supported under this component who have an ‘excellent’ performance record, ascertained using the FPO grading tool, issued from time to time. The process would be conducted and monitored through the MOVCDNER MIS.

Primary mobile/ minimal processing unit/ pre-cooling/ cold store/ ripening chamber/ integrated pack house/ refrigerated transport vehicle components

  – Having facilities for cleaning, grading, postharvest processing, ripening, packaging, transport etc. Maximum assistance will be restricted to 75%, maximum of ₹ 37.5 lakhs (75% subsidy or 37.50 lakhs against TFO of ₹ 50.00 lakhs).

2.  Integrated processing unit - Maximum assistance will be restricted to 75% of TFO for FPOs or 50% of TFO for private entrepreneurs, with both restricted to a maximum assistance of ₹ 6 Crores.

  Note: It is recommended that the project components of warehouse /seed store/small cold store; collection and aggregation centers and Primary/Mobile/Minimal processing including packhouse and cold chain components should be developed together for optimizing civil infrastructure sparing more funds for procurement of equipment/ machinery.

Procedure for grant and release of subsidy component for postharvest infrastructure

  Role of key stakeholders for post-harvest infrastructure

a)  SLEC– Sanctions for all the components covered under Postharvest value addition and processing will be done by the SLEC. Primary Processing Units are meant for FPOs and CLFs of SRLMs while Integrated Processing Units should preferably be granted to entrepreneurs who have credit linkages. The SLEC should ensure that proposals by entrepreneurs and FPOs are considered for approval within three months from the date of submission. Investment decisions by entrepreneurs and FPOs are based on predictable timelines. Delays could result in cost escalations, missed opportunities, and impact on business sentiments.

b)  SLA: The SLA shall be responsible for the selection of eligible proposals under the scheme through an open invitation for Expression of Interest on an annual basis. The beneficiary will be required to submit the project proposal including an application for subsidy. SLAs should ensure that all documents required for claiming subsidy are provided by the applicant before consideration by SLEC. The SLA will also be responsible for due diligence of projects under component 9.3.1. and utilise the support of engineers, specialists from other line departments for expertise.

  DLMCs should play an active role in supporting FPOs and entrepreneurs in their respective districts to submit their applications.

Sanction/Grant of Subsidy for Primary/Mobile/Minimal processing including packhouse and cold chain components (Maximum TFO of Rs. 50 lakhs)

i.  The subsidy will be available for the creation of postharvest value addition and processing infrastructure as per the list and details given in earlier.

ii. The rate of subsidy will be up to 75% of the Total Financial outlay (TFO) limited to the ceiling prescribed for that component for FPO/FPCs created under MOVCDNER.

iii. SLA/ DLMC shall be responsible for inviting applications (including DPRs and necessary documents) and sanctioning of subsidy after explicit approval by SLEC.

iv. The SLA may form a technical committee consisting of specialists from other line departments to evaluate the applications and DPRs submitted by FPOs, as per the prevailing norms of the state.

v.  The front-ended subsidy shall be released in three instalments with each instalment linked to the achievement of pre-defined project milestones, in the DPR, including utilization of beneficiary contribution, validation of which will be done by SLA/ DLMC.

Sanction/Grant of Subsidy for Integrated Processing Unit

i.  The State Lead Agency shall partner with a scheduled commercial bank which will be responsible for maintaining the subsidy funds and extending credit to entrepreneurs, FPOs and other eligible beneficiaries.

ii. States will invite applications through an open EOI from FPOs, entrepreneurs, CLFs of SRLMs, government agencies and public-private joint ventures every year based on allocations. Proposals may also be forwarded by DLMCs.

iii. SLA shall ensure that all documents for subsidy claim, including term loan sanction letter from the scheduled commercial bank are submitted by the applicant. The partnered scheduled commercial bank will conduct a project appraisal for granting the loan which has to be leveraged by the SLA for techno-commercial feasibility assessment of the project.

iv. The SLA shall seek approval from SLEC for eligible applications. The SLEC shall select and approve the applications within three months from the date of submission.

v.  The guidelines of the lending bank will be followed in addition to the following:

    - A joint pre-sanction site inspection will be done by the Subsidy Sanctioning Committee, consisting of officials from SLA and the lending bank. Based on the assessment of the physical progress/status of the project compared to pre-defined milestones in the DPR, the subsidy amount will be sanctioned and released on a pro-rata basis depending on the utilization of the beneficiary contributions. The subsidy is expected to be released in three (3) instalments, before which a site visit by the Subsidy Sanctioning Committee is mandatory.

vi. FPO/FPCs will be exempted from the requirement of credit-link, provided it arranges its share through member contribution on a prorated basis of the instalments of subsidy release and route project development expenditure through bank transactions. For due diligence on such projects, SLA may take assistance from relevant experts, the cost for which (as per prevailing norms in the state) can be part of project cost.

vii. Only the entrepreneurs/ companies, Govt agencies or joint ventures with or without state Govt as partners willing to process the commodities produced by FPOs under MOVCDNER, should be considered for grant of subsidy. Interested entrepreneurs/companies, Govt agencies or Joint ventures need to ensure that at least 50% of the installed capacity will be used for processing the produce from MOVCDNER FPOs. The applicant must enter into agreements with MOVCDNER FPOs to procure this produce. The banking partner shall monitor the same by seeking an annual report (including documentary proof) from the beneficiary and associated FPO.

viii. SLAs shall ensure that at least 10% of the TFO is based on credit from a scheduled commercial bank to ensure financial due diligence. This loan shall be released along with subsidy instalments.

ix. The value of land for the proposed unit will be considered while calculating the beneficiary/promoter contribution. However, while calculating the beneficiary contribution, the cost of land should not exceed 10% of the total project cost.

x.  Financial institutions/banks shall sanction the loan as per their procedure and issue the necessary sanction letter for submission to the SLA of the state Government.

xi. Promoter shall submit the bank loan sanction letter along with DPR and copy of agreements with FPO/FPC (in cases of promoter being agency other than the MOVCDNER FPO/FPC) to SLA for the sanction of SLEC.

Insurance Coverage

  The assets created by beneficiaries under the scheme shall be covered under the loan insurance protection plan during the credit period. The cost of insurance coverage should be included as part of the project cost, which is also eligible under capital subsidy.

Screening of Loan applications

  Screening of loan applications will be done as per the loan financing norms of Commercial Banks/Financial Institutions. Detailed appraisal and sanctioning will also be made as per the loan financing norms of Commercial Banks/Financial Institutions. Once the proposal is accepted for financial assistance, detailed scrutiny of all the aspects of the project like managerial competence, technical feasibility, market prospects, commercial viability and financial soundness along with other compliance issues indicated in the Operation Guidelines will be assessed while obtaining necessary sanction for the loan proposal. The loan sanction information by Commercial Banks/Financial Institutions shall be communicated to SLA/ DLMC for onward approval by the SLEC and release of subsidy. The loan component is expected to be released in three instalments.

  The loan sanctioned to the beneficiaries should have a minimum repayment period of five years and the bank should monitor the adherence of the established processing unit to the requirements stated in this guideline, especially procurement and processing of organic produce. If the beneficiary fails to comply, SLA should necessary action to recover the subsidy amount disbursed under the scheme.

Value chain Marketing:

1.  Branding, brand promotion, Seminars/ conferences, workshops, Buyer- seller meets, Auction meetings, festivals and hiring spaces in prime markets

  North Eastern states collectively and independently need to build their brand identity to visually propagate values, narratives and quality parameters. Marketing and advertising agencies can be engaged to create this unique identity. Communication and outreach to the potential markets are key to success in changing the perception of organic as a luxury purchase to an affordable and accessible commodity for the good of soil, environment and human health. Brand building/ brand promotion also requires programs to train farmers and FPOs in inculcating branding principles in their packaging and their handling of the products. Programs are also needed to train logistics providers, marketers and other value chain partners in upholding the brand value from time to time. SLA/ DLMC shall draw a comprehensive plan in consultation with the Project Management Unit to have synergistic efforts by all states to realize the goals. SLA/ DLMC can assist farmers and FPCs in developing common packaging and labelling, common literature and common brand promotion material as a part of branding and market initiatives.

  To create awareness in the market and trading fraternity, SLA/ DLMC shall organize seminars/ conferences, workshops, buyer-seller meets in their state or at places of market importance in other states. Participation in exhibitions, trade fairs and organic festivals can also be facilitated.

  SLA/ DLMC shall draw a comprehensive plan for the systematic launching of campaigns for consumer awareness and product information through print and electronic and social media publicity, distribution of quality literature, video films, and local advertisements.

  SLA/ DLMC shall facilitate effective marketing launch of their value-added organic products through periodic market campaigns in selected cities of the country by hiring spaces in prime locations (within and outside the state) and malls to create awareness and demonstrate the quality and uniqueness of their products.

  If additional funds are made available, the SLA/ DLMC may develop a revolving fund with their respective banking partners to help FPOs have a common pool of working capital as and when required. Guidelines for the revolving fund will be provided by DA&FW in this regard. This would enable the states to monitor the marketing activities and also enable FPOs to have effective aggregation and linkages with institutional buyers.

Innovative components not covered in any other schemes:

  The objective of the scheme is to develop an ecosystem for promotion of organic value chain. To achieve this, the SLA/ DLMC may propose innovative projects which are not covered in any other scheme and may be examined and sanctioned by IMC.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT AT THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL

1.  Project management at the State level – 2.66% of funds of total plan allocation to the state under the scheme will be earmarked for project management, resource hiring (staff on contract (including for IT), Office infrastructure, hiring of professional agency) at the state level, publicity etc.

2.  Project management through mission management Cell, surveillance, evaluation, and professional support services at the National level – 2.66% of the total plan budget of the overall scheme will be earmarked for the Project Management Unit, Professional support services at the National Level including hiring of professional agencies.

  DA&FW may also deploy professional firms with technical experts as Project management Units in consultation with states for market linkages, capacity building, handholding and assistance in professional service/ technology facilitation. Capacity building, exposure visits and market outreach activities including participation in national and international exhibitions, B2B meets etc. at the national level for the project management team will also be taken up under this component.

Checklist of activities for FPOs

  This is an exhaustive list of activities to be completed during the implementation phase. The states need to fill the sheet for each FPO by clearly stating the responsible entity (SLA, service provider, ATMA, KVK, etc) and submit to DA&FW to ensure accountability. Subsequently, the activities of the states will be monitored by DA&FW every quarter based on this checklist.
