# “Turning Climate Commitments into Action: India’s Carbon Offset Plan Hits the Ground ”

Posted On: 28 MAR 2025 8:05PM by PIB Delhi

Towards India’s commitment on emission intensity reduction, Government of India has already notified The Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, 2023 in June 2023, and laid the foundation for the Indian Carbon Market (ICM) by establishing the institutional framework, including the National Steering Committee for Indian Carbon Market (NSCICM). In December 2023, the scheme was amended to introduce the Offset Mechanism, enabling participation from non-obligated entities through voluntary climate mitigation projects.

Moving the journey of carbon market forward, the Government of India has now approved the Detailed Procedure for the Offset Mechanism and eight different methodologies under Offset Mechanism. This marks a major step forward in the operationalization of the Offset Mechanism under ICM.

The Offset Mechanism will encourage voluntary participation by entities for developing projects that reduce, remove, or avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This framework enables businesses, industries, and organizations—particularly those not covered under the compliance mechanism—to participate in climate action and receive carbon credits for verified emission reductions. This mechanism will enable our country to tap climate change mitigation from sectors not covered under the compliance mechanism and can incentivize actions in such sectors.

Eight methodologies under Offset Mechanism, approved by Central Government, include methodologies for renewable energy (including Hydro and Pumped storage), green hydrogen production, industrial energy efficiency, landfill methane recovery, and mangrove afforestation & reforestation. These methodologies are expected to support a wide range of climate-friendly projects for voluntary carbon credit generation.
