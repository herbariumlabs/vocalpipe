PGS-India Standards

General Note

  PGS-India standards have been defined in tune with National Standards for Organic Production (NSOP) prescribed under National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) to maintain uniformity in organic production process and quality of organic products in the country. For ease of functioning and understanding standards are presented here in easy to understand and simplified form. For further clarification and correct interpretation readers may refer to National Programme for Organic Production available at http://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/organic/ORGANIC_CONTENTS/National_Pro gramme_for_Organic_Production.htm as amended from time to time.

  Appendix 1

 Organic Crop Production

Scope

  Crop production standards prescribed here refer to cultivation of any agricultural and non-agricultural crops/ plants for the production of food and fibre and their derivatives or by-products and collection of non-timber wild harvest produce from natural forests.

Habitat Management and General Requirements

a.  Maintain sufficient diversity on farm through maintenance of diversity plantations, biological nitrogen fixation bushes and trees on farm boundary or as hedge rows. Integration of randomly located multipurpose trees on farm bunds and in utility spaces help in creation of habitat for maintenance and survival of different beneficial life forms.

b.  Integration of agro-forestry, if feasible should be considered

c.  Adequate measures should be adopted to conserve and harvest rain water

d.  Preferably the entire land holding with livestock should be converted to organic according to these standards.

e.  If it is not possible to convert the entire farm (split production) then the measures must be in place to ensure that organic and non-organic parts are clearly and continuously separate.

f.  Simultaneous production of same crop (parallel production) in organic and non- organic needs to be avoided.

Diversity Management

a.  Organic farming systems should avoid monocropping and ensure continuously changing farm diversity. Diversity is also a key to maintain soil fertility and to effectively manage the pressure from insects, diseases and weeds. Diversity should also help in maintaining or increasing soil organic matter, soil fertility, microbial activity and general soil health.

b.  Diversity can be achieved by adopting mixed cropping, intercropping and crop rotations. Cover crops, trap crops and multi-layered farming practices are also effective tools for diversity management. Soil fertility can be maintained by integration of legumes or deep rooted plants in cropping systems, frequent use of green manures, planned rotations and fertilization with organic inputs.

Integration of livestock

  As organic farming systems largely depend upon farming system approach, therefore it is important to integrate livestock along with crop production. This will not only help in overall farm diversity but will also ensure continuous availability of dung and urine for manuring and soil fertility management.

Soil and Water Conservation

a.  Soil and water resources to be managed in sustainable manner and measures to be taken to prevent erosion and salination of soil, excessive and improper use of water and the pollution of ground and surface water.

b.  Clearing or destruction of forest is prohibited, burning of straw or biomass shall be restricted to minimum

c.  Measures to be in place to prevent land degradation and pollution of ground and surface water.

Contamination Control

a.  Adequate measures to be taken to prevent contamination through water, air drift, mixing or comingling through:

b.  Raised bunds and escape channels to prevent rain water runoff from non- organic fields

c.  Buffer zones between organic and non-organic farms

d.  Separate storage in time and space both for inputs and farm produce

e.  Cleaning of machines and tools while using in organic farm

f.  Any other measure suggested by the group/ certification programme

Conversion requirements

a.  For a farm and its crop production products to be certified organic, it is mandatory that the farm and entire farming operations of organic production unit has under gone a period of conversion, complying with all the standard requirements for following period:

    i.  36 months for perennial plants

    ii. 24 months for plants/ crops other than perennials

b.  In cases where de-facto requirements under these standards have been met for several years and the same can be verified from available documents, conversion period can be reduced to 12 months at the discretion of Regional Council.

c.  In default organic areas where there is no history of prohibited substances use and administration has imposed the ban on use of such substances and adequate measures are in place to prevent entry of such prohibited substances, the requirement of conversion period can be dispensed with. But such exception can be granted only by the PGS Secretariat on recommendations of RC after physical verification.

Seeds and planting material

a.  All seeds and planting material shall be certified organic. When certified organic seed and planting materials are not available (Local group need to ensure non-

  availability), chemically untreated conventional seed and planting material can be used.

b.  Use of Genetically modified seed/ planting material/ transgenic plants, microorganisms (GMO) or their products, directly or indirectly are strictly prohibited

Soil fertility and nutrient management

a.  Green manuring, legume cover crop/ intercropping, multi cropping, effective crop rotations and recycling of organic farm generated plant biomass through composting or mulching should form the basis of nutrient management

b.  Sufficient quantities of biodegradable material of plant or animal origin should be used

c.  Biodegradable material of plant/animal origin must be composted through aerobic composting method where pile temperature has been maintained between 131⁰ and 170⁰ F for minimum 5 days.

d.  Raw dung-urine products should be used only after controlled fermentation

e.  Mined mineral fertilizers in their natural composition can be used. In case of micronutrient deficiency, micronutrients can be used mixed with compost.

f.  Off-farm/ purchased inputs should be evaluated before use by the group to ensure that no prohibited substances have been used in their making and method of production is physical, mechanical or biological.

g.  Off-farm/industry produced inputs approved by NPOP accredited certification body as approved input for use in organic farming can be used without further approval of the group.

h.  Microbial preparations such as biofertilizers, biodynamic preparations, EM solutions etc can be used.

i.  Use of mineral nitrogen and all synthetic fertilizers, chemical hormones, synthetic growth promoters, directly or indirectly are prohibited.

j.  Use of sewage, sludge, human excreta or their products are prohibited

Insect pest, disease and weed management

a.  Insect pest and disease management should rely primarily on best management practices such as balanced soil fertility management, use of crops and varieties resistant to pests and adapted to local situations, diversity management, effective crop rotations, multi-cropping/ intercropping, green manures, manipulation of planting and sowing time and habitat manipulation through diversified plats, hedge rows, insectary plants, trap crops etc.

Products approved for use in organic farming by certification bodies accredited under National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) can also be used.

d.  Natural mined products and biological products such as microbial biopesticides can be used

e.  On-farm produced plant extracts, oils or fermented products can be used provided no synthetic ingredients is used in such preparations,

f.  Weed management can be done through mulching with biodegradable material, mowing, livestock grazing, hand or mechanical weeding, flame, heat or electrical means or by using plastic or other synthetic mulches, provided that such mulches are removed from the field after harvest.

g.  Use of synthetic herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and other chemical preparations including synthetic plant growth regulators and synthetic dyes are strictly prohibited. Use of genetically engineered organisms or products are also prohibited.
