What is Natural Farming?

  Natural Farming is a chemical- free farming system.

  Bio-inputs used in Natural Farming are prepared on-farm. Optimum utilization of locally available raw materials such as cow dung, cow urine, bio- resources etc.

Is this natural farming a new technology?

  No, Natural Farming is not a new

  technology.

  This is ancient Indian tradition and based on wisdom of farmers

  What is the base of Natural Farming?

  Natural Farming is Based on Five main Components (Panchsutra )

  Panchsutra

6

  Which are the 5 Components of Natural Farming ? (Panchsutra)

  Minimum Soil Disturbance & Whapsa

  Mulching & Cultural Practices

  Natural Farming

  Multi-Cropping

  Plant & Animal Based Bio-Inputs

  Bio-Diversity

7

Minimum Soil Disturbance & Whapsa

What is Minimum Soil Disturbance?

  The activities adopted during soil preparation in natural farming which reduces the disturbance in soil.

How it can be achived?

  Reduced tillage practices (such as ploughing, harrowing, and all the tillage operations ordinarily applied to prepare the soil for seed germination. Direct seeding.

  Direct application of Bio- inputs for soil Health.

Benefits of Minimum Soil Disturbance

  Improves soil stability & structure Increase soil organic matter Reduce soil erosion

  Reduce fuel use (as minimum agriculture machinery used) Increase carbon storage

  Enhances water infiltration

  Increased soil fertility through enhanced nitrogen stocks (in the long term) Improves soil, water, and air quality

What is Whapsa?

  It is the condition where there are both air molecules and water molecules

  present in the cavity between two soil particles. It is the soil’s microclimate on which soil organisms and roots depend for most of their moisture and some of their nutrients.

What are the benefits?

  It increases water availability Enhances water-use efficiency

  Builds resilience in plants against drought.

8

Multi-Cropping

What is Multi-cropping?

  Multi-cropping is growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land.

Benefits of Multi-Cropping

  Improves soil fertility Increase in crop yield

  Refuse from one crop plant help in the growth of the other crop plant and vice-versa.

  It is an insurance against crop failure due to abnormal weather conditions.

  It is done to reduce the competition between component crops for light, nutrients and water. If one crop fails due to shortage of moisture or insufficient availability of nutrients, the other crop can cover the risk of complete failure.

  Growing multi-crops ensures enough fodder stocks for cattles.

  Growing a variety of crops together minimizes pest problems and makes efficient use of soil nutrients, water, and land.

  It helps to suppress weeds, as weeds find it difficult to grow alongside some crops.

  Example: Finger millet may be mixed with pearl millet, maize, sorghum, groundnut, tapioca, pulses and vegetables.

9

Bio-Diversity

  What is Bio-Diversity? Biodiversity is the number and variety of plants, animals and

  other organisms that are living in an ecosystem.

Importance of Bio-Diversity

  Biodiversity helps farmers understand how different species interact with one another in an ecosystem.

  It helps in creating healthy soils, leading to better crops that contain more nutrients that are needed for human consumption.

  Ensures food security by providing many different types of foods in a single area so that if one type of crop fails due to drought or other conditions then others will still be available for harvest.

  It also helps provide pollinator species such as bees and butterflies that are necessary for pollinating plants such as wheat, soybeans, and corn.

  It also provides predators which manage populations of harmful pests Biodiversity is important for agriculture because it provides us with food, fiber, and medicines.

How Natural Farming Helps in Maintaining Bio-Diversity

  Natural Farming helps to increase organic matter in soil. Healthy soil supports more soil biodiversity such as beneficial microbes, earthworms etc.

  Natural farming helps in maintaining population of beneficial insects/birds/pollinators.

  Crop diversification increases the adaptation capacity of agricultural systems to climate change by improving soil fertility and structure, soil water holding capacity and water and nutrients distribution through the soil profile, helping to prevent pests and diseases, and increasing yield stability.

  2)Live Mulch:

 Mulching

  What is Mulching? Mulching is defined as covering of soil surface using both live crops and straw (dead plant biomass).

What are the types of Mulching?

  There are two types of mulching-

  1) Crop Residue Mulch:

  Crop materials leftover after harvesting such as: dried leaves, straw, small twigs etc. are used to cover the soil.

  Live mulching is practiced by developing multi-cropping/inter cropping patterns of short durational crops in the rows of a main crop.

  Example: planting wheat/rice (supply nutrients such as potash, phosphate and Sulphur)with pulses (nitrogen-fixing plants)

Benefits of Mulching

  Prevents soil against severe sunlight, cold, rain etc. Saves seeds from birds, insects, and animals.

  Conserve moisture

  Lowers soil temperature around plant roots Prevent soil erosion

  Reduce runoff Reduce weed growth.

  Reduce the demand of a particular type of plant nutrient

Procedure of Mulching

  Carefully remove all weeds from the area where mulching has to be done. The soil should be well loosened.

  Once the soil is well-prepared, you can apply the mulch. Generally, mulch layers with a height of between 5 and 15 cm. have proven successful.

  When spreading the mulch, be sure to leave enough distance from the

  stems of the plants. 18

Cultural Practices in Natural Farming

Land Preparation

  100 Kg FYM mixed with 100 Kg Ghanajeevamrit per acre should be

  applied before sowing

Seed Treatment

  Seed should be treated with Beejamrit for controlling seed born

  disease and to increase viability of seeds.

Pre Monsoon Dry Sowing (PMDS)

  Raising of Pre Monsoon Dry Sowing (PMDS) with a minimum of 9 varieties of crops comprising of Pulses, Oil Seeds, Millets, Vegetables and leafy vegetables etc. The essential principle is to have 365 days green cover.

Application of Jeevamrit

  After sowing, 200 litres of jeevamrit per acre should be given in soil with irrigation water. 200 litres of jeevamrit per acre should be given with irrigation water at an interval of 15 days in a month.

  Jeevamrit/Saptdhanyankur Spray:-

1)  1st spray, after one month of planting 5 litre jeevamrit mixed with 100 litre of water.

2)  2nd spray, after 21 days of first spray 7.5 litre jeevamrit mixed with 120 litre of water.

3)  3rd spray, after 21 days of first spray 10 litre jeevamrit mixed with 150 litre of water.

4)  4th spray, after 21 days of first spray 15 litre jeevamrit mixed with 150 litre of water.

5)  5th spray, after 21 days of first spray 3 litre sour buttermilk mixed with 100 litre of water.

6)  6th spray ,after 21 days of first spray 15 litre jeevamrit mixed with 150 litre of water.

Use of Growth Promotors

(1) Panchagavya: 4 lits in 100 litres of water/acre for 1 time at flowering stage .

(2) Saptdhanyakura tonic: 700gms of paste in 200l litre of water at pod development stage (December/January).

19

Cultural Practices in Natural Farming

Mulching

  After sowing of seeds, plant residue is used as mulching.

Crop Protection Measures

1.  Use of different concoctions (Neemastra, Brahamastra, Agniastra Dashparni, Sour Buttermilk, Sonthastra etc.)

2.  Use of Pheromone Traps

3.  Use of Light Traps

4.  Use of Yellow & Sticky traps.

5.  Use of Bird Penches
