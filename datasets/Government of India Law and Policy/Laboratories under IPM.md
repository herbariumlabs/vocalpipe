# **State Bio-Control Laboratory (SBCL):**

State Bio-Control Laboratory (SBCL), Ulubari,Guwahati-7 have been established in the year 2001 with the following aims and objectives.

# **Obejectives:**

1. Standardization of technology for protection of different crops against pests

2. Standardization of methods of mass production of predators, parasitoids & pathogens.  
3. Utilization, Evaluation of predators, parasitoids and pathogens in different agro- ecosystem.  
4. Training to the trainers and farmers in identification, production, utilization and evaluation of bio-control agents.  
5. Conservation and augmentation of natural enemies already present in the farmer’s field.

6. Multiplication of bio-agents in the laboratory and subsequent release in the farmer’s field against their target pests.  
7. Monitoring and surveillance of insect pests, disease, weeds and bio-agents.

# **Function of SBCL:**

The SBCL is under Office of the Deputy Director of Agriculture (IPM) and which is now a separate establishment as per Govt. notification No.AGA.218/ 2014/10 dtd Dispur the 23rd April/2015. Previously, it was under the establishment of District Agril. Officer, Kamrup.  
Since its inception though it had been either producing or evaluating a few bio- control agents for **bio-pesticides** such as *Pseudomonas fluorescens, Beuvaria basiana, Trichderma harzianum, Metarhizium anisopliae & Bacillus thuringiensis* and **biofertilizers** such as Azotobacter, Azosiprillum, Phosphate Solubilising Bacteria (PSB), Potash Mobilizing Bacteria (PMB) the activities cannot be continued due to some difficulties. The laboratory has also been producing bio-agents *Trichgramma japonicum, Trichgramma chilonis* (Tricho- cards) for controlling of various harmful insects of Paddy and vegetables. Trichogramma egg parasite is mass reared and supplied to the farmers for field release, so that there is conservation and augmentation of natural enemies of the pests in the field. The functions of SBCL are categorized as follows-

1. # **Pest Surveillance**

   1. Regular field surveys.  
   2. Fortnightly rapid roving surveys.

2. # **Mass Multiplication and Field releases of Bio-control Agents**

   1. Mass multiplication of parasites and predators in the laboratory.

   2. Imparting technical know-how to State extension functionaries and farmers.

3. # **Conservation to maintain natural balance**

   1. Farmers are advised to adopt such crop husbandry practices, which can preserve and conserve the crop defenders.  
   2. Popularization of AESA (Agro-ecosystem analysis) in the seasonal crops.

   3. Farmers are encouraged to collect biological information with respect to the pests and defenders of their seasonal crops.

   4. Advocacy of eco-friendly pesticides to maintain natural balance

4. # **Promotion of IPM Concept**

   1. Organizing of Farmers’ field schools on seasonal crops so that message of IPM can percolate to the grass root level.

   2. Participation in Kisan melas, local fairs, seminars etc. to promote and publicize the concept of IPM.

   3. Organization of Farmers awareness programmers.

   4. Maintenance of effective liaison, co-ordination with State Department of Agriculture, State Agricultural University, Research Stations, KVKs, NGOs and other concerned organizations.

5. # **Publicity**

   Pamphlets, leaflets and relevant literature are prepared in local language so that the message can be conceived by the rural folk with an overwhelming response
