**OFFICE MEMORANDUM**

**Subject: Approved Sectors in Offset Mechanism under CCTS by Central Government**

The Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022 empowered the Central Government to specify the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme. The framework for Indian Carbon Market was developed by notifying the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) vide S.O. 2825(E), dated 28th June 2023 and amendment notification S.O. 5369(E), dated 19th December 2023.

Under the CCTS, the Central Government has constituted the National Steering Committee for Indian Carbon Market (NSC-ICM) co-chaired by Secretary Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Secretary, Ministry of Power to have direct oversight of the functioning of Indian carbon market. With reference to the sub paragraph
