\*\*\*

# **CHAPTER 2**

### **MANDATORY ACTIVITIES**

**PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL PLAN OF OPERATION FOR MANDATORY AND OTHER ACTIVITIES**

1. #### **Compensatory Afforestation (Including Additional and Penal):**

1. The Compensatory Afforestation (CA) primarily aims at compensating the loss of forest, tree cover and ecosystem services due to diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes.

2. The CA is to be implemented in the project/ mission mode aiming at holistic ecological restoration of the earmarked CA site(s), which are in varying degree of land degradation. The efforts should be directed to create forest-like vegetation representative to the site quality of the locality by the end of the project period.

3. The estimates of CA should factor site-specific requirements of creating suitable conditions for facilitating quick growth of natural vegetation representing the forest type of the area. Various stages of ecological succession should be taken into consideration while preparing comprehensive plan for ecological restoration, restoration and enrichment of local biodiversity and the forest productivity. There should be proper evaluation of the needs of protection of forest/ plantation site from anthropogenic and natural factors including fire etc. The eco- restoration measures should address drivers of forest degradation.

4. Timely completion of all CA and other mandatory activities specified in respect of any proposal for diversion of forest land approved under Van (Sanrakshan evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam, 1980 are to be accorded highest priority by the concerned States/ UTs and accordingly should be included in the proposed APO immediately after the grant of final approval.

5. The CA should be taken up only after the issuance of the Stage – II clearance (final FC approval) has been granted unless otherwise mentioned specifically in the terms and conditions of the approval of the project for the diversion of forest land for non-forestry use by the Government of India.

6. The backlog of CA, if any should be planned and completed on the highest priority.

7. The site(s) of the CA must be the same as has been approved under the proposal of diversion of forest land by the Central Government. KML files/ Geo referenced maps of the CA sites should match the details of the uploaded and approved KML file on PARIVESH Portal mentioned in the FC clearance.

8. In case of any change in the site(s) of CA and other mandatory activities, approval of competent authority should be obtained.

9. The demand of CA is raised by the concerned State/UT Forest Department with the user agency based on the approved estimates submitted with the proposal for obtaining forest clearance from the Government of India. Therefore, the amount for the proposed mandatory activities should be according to the approved estimates and escalation with justifiable reasons should be covered from the interest component under Rule 6(a) of CAF Rule, 2018\.

10. Before initiating the CA, the baseline data with respect to site(s) should be created on the existing vegetation, fauna in the area and surroundings, including the information on climatic, edaphic (soil quality and water availability) and topographic conditions, drivers of degradations like vulnerability to forest fire, soil erosion, grazing and anthropogenic pressure etc.

11. **Demarcation of site:** The afforestation site should be properly demarcated on the ground and secured with proper fencing before starting CA and other mandatory activities based on the site approved in the forest diversion approval. The activities involved in the CA plantation/ eco restoration scheme should incorporate relevant site-specific components.

12. #### **Creation of compensatory afforestation**

    1) **Preparatory Activities:**

       1) Afforestation site should be properly fenced to protect the plantation from anthropogenic/ biotic pressure.

### **NET PRESENT VALUE**

1. #### **Utilization of NPV Funds for improvement of quality of forest:**

1) The permissible activities are outlined in the sub-rule 5(2) and sub-rule 5(3) of the CAF Rules, 2018\. In addition, the National Authority gives suitable instructions from time to time to regulate utilisation of NPV funds for achieving measurable and verifiable positive outcomes in qualitative improvement and ecological restoration of degraded forests. NPV activities should lead to development of a normal forest type of vegetation representative of the local site quality.

2) Excessive reliance of the States/UTs on NPV funds for routine forestry activities will thinly spread precious NPV funds and will reduce fund availability for sustained maintenance of plantations, Artificial Regeneration (AR), Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR), nurseries, and other assets created through NPV funds in subsequent years. The use of NPV and Interest funds require fiscal discipline and diligent planning to ensure the regular availability.

3) The sub-rule 5(2) of the CAF Rules, 2018 mandates that at least 80% of NPV funds are to be allocated to afforestation and related activities, which is vital for enhancing forest cover quality, restoring degraded lands, and enriching biodiversity. The sub-rule 5(3) of CAF Rules, 2018, mandates that 20% of the NPV funds be used for essential infrastructure supportand capacity building that has direct impact on extension and improvement of forest cover and wildlife habitat.

4) In preparing States/UTs Annual Plan of Operations, priority should be given for maintainingANR, AR and other plantations established in prior years. Completion of ongoing works of previous years should be considered before proposing new activities.

5) As a principle, not more than 20% of the available NPV funds should be utilised annually with an additional 5% allocation permissible only for boundary demarcation and the voluntary relocation of villages from Protected Areas limiting maximum NPV expenditure up to 25%.

6) The NPV works should priority to undertake identified activities in those villages which have been affected due to diversion of forest land. States/UTs to prioritise for preparation of the Annual Plan of Operation the referred explanation 1 of the CAF Rules, 2018 under sub-rule 5(2) and sub-rule 5(3) as below:

   1) Priority shall be given to undertake identified activities in those villages which have been affected due to diversion of forest land;  
   2) Priority shall be given to undertake those identified activities which has employment potential for local communities and creates community assets for the benefit of local community;  
   3) Afforestation and plantation of indigenous plant species shall be undertaken in consultation with the local community dependent on forest.

   2. #### **Perspective Plan**

   The utilization of NPV funds, as per Rules 5(2) and 5(3) of the CAF Rules, 2018, requires strict financial discipline. Therefore, it is essential to prepare a perspective plan for a minimum of five years, similar to the Working Plan. This plan should include a periodic assessment of available NPV funds and forecast future funds requirement focusing on Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) and Artificial Regeneration (AR) to restore forests, strengthening forest protection infrastructure including construction of residential and office buildings for forest frontline staff, procurement of necessary IT and monitoring tools, firefighting equipment, and support for the voluntary relocation of villages from protected areas. This perspective plan will ensure the effective and sustainablemanagement of NPV funds.

   An OM vide File No. NA-5/1/2020-NA dated 22nd July 2024 and a letter vide no. NA-5/1/2020- NA dated 30th May, 2023 circulated on the Guidelines for preparation of APO of States/UTs CAMPA-Utilization of funds under Net Present Value and Interest components ***\[Annexure II, Annexure III\].*** NPV and Perspective plans discussed in EC are outlined in Chapter 7\.

   3. #### **Preparation of the Annual Plan of Operation for NPV activities**

      1. **Net Present Value Activities**

   As per Rule 5 (2) NPV funds are to be used for regeneration, including plantations (both artificial plantation andassisted natural regeneration) and ecological restoration activities to compensate for forest andecosystem loss. NPV activities focus on improving forest quality and wildlife habitats. While CA funds are site-specific and mandatory for carrying out compensatory afforestation, NPV funds aim to improve the quality of forest cover, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem services.

   There is a need to align utilization of NPV strictly with the CAF Rules and Working Plan prescriptions and the DFOs are advised to consider the following instructions while formulating the APOs:

1) #### **Utilization of 80% or above Rule 5(2) for following activities:**

   1. **Selection of Area:** The area selection for Assisted Natural regeneration should fall under the category of degraded forests (\<40% of density class) which has sufficient root stock available and can be restored by creating favourable conditions of natural regeneration, controlling drivers of degradation, soil-water conservation and augmentation with plantation of local species to 200-600 saplings per hectare. After the ANR efforts, it is expected that on completion of the efforts, the area will shift to higher density class with enrichment/ conservation of of biodiversity.

   2. #### **Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR):**

      1) ANR or AR plantation should be taken up in a large area by selecting a Forest Block, Series of Compartments with varying degrees of degradation of forest part of Protection/ Conservation Working Circle in accordance with a suitable plantation cycle so that the area is covered in 5-10 years with use of minimum fencing on the vulnerable sites.

      2) ANR and AR plantations should be taken up in a project mode to cover as much as possible forest area in a landscape approach through integrated action. Efforts should be made to

   secure thearea from biotic factors and initially the peripheral area should be covered so that the forest area of the interior gets time to regenerate itself.

      3) In afforestation, locally suitable species should be used to enrich and enhance biodiversity.

      4) A mix of species including various *Ficus* spp., fruit bearing plants/ fodder/ NTFP/ medicinal plants/bamboo, etc. should be planted.

      5) Natural regeneration should be facilitated by cultural operations.

      6) Soil and moisture conservation shall be integrated with afforestation activities.

      7) At least one fourth of the tree species should be fruit bearing as per agro-climatic suitability.

      8) As per practice, most of the APOs received from DFOs are pertaining to plantation including gap planting by clearing the area and planting of locally growing major tree species. It is advised to consider **“Assisted Natural Regeneration”** and use standard practices of ANR for important species like Teak, Sal, Sissoo, Sandalwood, Fir, Deodar, Kail, Chir and other dominant species (as provided in the working plans) including those available in forests as per Working Plan prescriptions.  
   3. **Artificial Regeneration (AR)**: Forest areas in high degree of degradation (scrub or low density open forests) with less natural regeneration potential should be covered under artificial regeneration/ plantation supported by soil and water conservation, control of forest fire, protection of area and plantation of local species as per site conditions, Soil type keeping in view the State specific norms/ standards of plantation. With the afforestation (AR) efforts, the area is expected to shift to moderate or higher density forest representative to the forest type of the area on completion of treatment.

   Normally, the area selected for Artificial Regeneration or Plantation under NPV should be restored in a period of 4-6 years. If the degraded forest is in severe degree of degradation and will require major efforts and significantly longer period for ecological restoration, such sites should be covered under compensatory afforestation.

   4. **Silvicultural Operations in Forests:** The Silvicultural Operation involving pruning, training, coppicing, singling etc. should be undertaken as per Working Plan prescriptions.

   5. **Protection of Plantation and Forests**: The consolidation of forest area and securing their boundary is the highest priority to ensure protection of the forest from encroachment and fragmentation. Therefore, survey and demarcation of the forest area should be done if not already carried out in the past. The forest area should be secured by erection/ re-fixing of boundarypillars.

   6. **Pest and Disease Control in Forests:** The Pest and control activities should be taken up with the advice of expert agencies viz. ICFRE institutions.

   7. **Forest Fire Prevention and Control Operations**: The APO should consider all possible site specific silvicultural sound fire prevention measures like creation and maintenance of effective fire lines, planting of fire- resistant evergreen species along the fire lines and suitable Water Harvesting Structures to ensure moisture retention and minimize fire incidents and increase fire resilience.

   The proposed activities for controlling and prevention of forest fire in the APO of State CAMPA should include the following:

      1) The proposal should be in conformity with the approved State Forest Fire Action Plan

      2) The plan should prioritise vulnerable areas based on the data of fire incidences shared by FSI or the Forest Department and need assessment.  
      3) The existing length of Fire lines and their geo-tagged (kml) files.  
      4) New fire lines proposed, if any should be as per approved Plan .  
      5) The maintenance of fire lines should mention the length of firelines being maintained from State Fund, CSS and others and the works proposed under State CAMPA APO.  
      6) Procurement of firefighting equipment and other activities proposed should be clearly mentioned under CAMPA, CSS and State Plan.  
      7) The existing inventory of firefighting equipments should be furnished alongwith the fresh requirements.  
      8) The vehicles proposed for engaging on hired basis should be for the fire-season only.  
      9) Utilisation of CAMPA Funds in a fire control and prevention activity should be on stand alone basis without mixing of CAMPA funds with other funds.

   8. **Soil and Moisture Conservation Works in the Forests:** SMC works in the forest should be based on site specific requirements after a scientific study of the topography alongwith suitable vegetative measures to prevent soil erosion to ensure that the treated area is able to retain moisture during dry periods, contributes to revival of streams, springs and recharge of ground aquifers. This will also help in natural regeneration and growth of grasses/ shrubs etc. and mitigate forest fires, human-animal conflict.

   9. **Supply of wood-saving cooking appliances and other forest produce saving devices in forest fringe villages:** Under *Ujjwala* Scheme, Government is providing LPG to all States/UTs, hence providing an LPG option under this component may not be encouraged. However, in some remote areas, there may be a need for providing alternatives to firewood or go for efficient systems like improved cook stoves or solar heating options, which reduce pressure on forests for removal of firewood. Hence, the Controlling Officers must guide the DFOs and exercise due diligence in ensuring developing an innovative APO focusing on alternatives to mitigate pressure on forests and creation of livelihood as a spin-of.

   10. **Management of Biological Diversity and Biological Resources:** There is a need to conserve and enrich local biodiversity in the forests including the unique biodiversity endemic to the area.

2) ### **UTILIZATION OF UP TO 20% RULE 5(3) FOR FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES:**

   1. Part of the funds under the 20% component shall be utilized for creating and upgrading infrastructure to enhance the capacity of frontline staff involved in forest protection and management, to ensure effective implementation of conservation efforts.

   A comprehensive need assessment (survey) shall be conducted to evaluate the existing infrastructure for frontline staff, including offices, quarters, check posts, control rooms, transportation, communication devices and equipment, to identify gaps, deficiencies, and priorities to upgrade or development. In case of the infrastructure proposed for frontline staff following is required:

1) Office – Range office, Beat office, Camp office, check posts, labour shed

2) Residential – Range office Quarter, Dy. FRO, Forester, Forest Guard

3) The total requirement of office and residences of the frontline staff of the States should

   be assessed based on already existing infrastructure.

4) New requirement need to be phased out for at least 5 years.

5) 	CAMPA fund will not be used for maintenance of the existing infrastructure for residence and offices of the frontline staff except of those who are directly assigned for implementation of the CAMPA works.

6) CAMPA Funds will not be utilized for repair/ upgrade of buildings/ infrastructure developed by using funds other than CAMPA.

| S. No. | Type	of buildings | Total Requirement for the State/UT for next five years | Existing | Additional requirement |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  |  |  |  | From CAMPA | From	Other Schemes |
| **Offices** |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Forest	Range office |  |  |  |  |
|  | Beat office |  |  |  |  |
|  | Check Post |  |  |  |  |
|  | Labour Camp |  |  |  |  |
|  | Others |  |  |  |  |
| **Residential Quarters** |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Forest Ranger |  |  |  |  |
|  | Dy.	Forest Ranger |  |  |  |  |
|  | Forester |  |  |  |  |
|  | Forest Guard |  |  |  |  |
|  | Others |  |  |  |  |

   2. Likewise, the requirement of vehicles for patrolling for frontline staff, if any, should be accordingly worked out by taking into account the existing vehicles and additional requirement with priority to vulnerable areas.

   3. Production & utilization of Quality Planting stock is the backbone of plantation activities. The planting stock may vary from just a quality seed, seed ball, a stump or root cut, or a well nurtured and hardened seedling/ sapling.

   4. To enhance capacity of forest nurseries for meeting growing demand of seedlings and planting materials, upgrading existing facilities is essential. This can be achieved by incorporating additional infrastructure, such as shade houses, mist chambers, seed storage facilities, potting mixture yards, specialized nursery equipment, and root trainer nursery facilities. These upgrades will significantly improve production efficiency and enable the supply of high-quality planting materials, ultimately supporting successful afforestation and reforestation efforts.

### **INTEREST FUND**

1. #### **Utilisation of Interest Fund**

1) The permissible activities of the Interest amount are outlined in Rule 6(a) and 6(b) of the CAF Rules, 2018.The first priority of Interest Fund is to meet the enhanced expenditure on account of increase in wage rates and material costs.

2) As per Rules, provision of not less than 60% of the interest fund available and accrued on the State Fund are to be spent on activities for the purpose of conservation and development of forest and wildlife on the following:  
   1) Incremental cost due to increased wage rates

   2) Salary and allowances of the State Authority  
   3) Sitting fees and allowances to nominated members  
   4) For activities referred to in sub-rules (2) and (3) of Rule 5

3) The CAF Rules also provide that not more than 40% of the interest fund available and accrued on the amount available in the State Fund shall be spent for the non-recurring and recurring expenditure of the State Authority on the following:  
   1) Management of office establishment

   2) Office equipment for the State Authority  
   3) Hiring of staff cars for officials of the State Authority  
   4) Hiring of buildings on lease for office establishment and residences of the officers  
   5) any other activity of the forests and wildlife not referred to in sub-rules (2) and (3)

4) The mixing of the interest accrued on the monies in State Fund with any other state budget either for capital or spillover works is not permitted.

5) Works undertaken under Interest will be on standalone basis with no duplication.

6) States/UTs should first evaluate provision of future requirements of funds from the Interest Fund to complete the backlog of compensatory afforestation from previous years since 1980, if any.

7) The State/UT CAMPA should carry out proper estimation of the funds required from interest. The National CAMPA in order to rationalize annual expenditures from the available interest fund has capped a limit of 10% provision of available interest fund for utilisation of interest amount during a year with exceptions under Rule 6(a)(i) to (iv) where actual costs due to wage revision/ increase in cost of material may necessitate higher allocations.

8) An OM vide File No. NA-5/1/2020-NA dated 22nd July 2024 circulated on the Guidelines for preparation of APO of States/UTs CAMPA-Utilization of funds under Net Present Value and Interest components. ***\[Annexure II\].*** Activities under interest component

   discussed in EC are outlined in Chapter 7 \[7.4\].

   2. #### **Perspective Plan for utilisation of Interest:**

   Utilization of interest funds, as stipulated in Rules 6(a) and 6(b) of the CAF Rules, 2018, requires adherence to strict financial discipline. It is essential to develop a perspective plan of five to ten years detailing year-wise activities planned to be implemented from interest fund, similar to the Working Plan, which will include periodic assessments of available interest funds and projections for future requirements. The perspective plan should prioritize covering increased costs in compensatory afforestation, catchment area treatment, and wildlife management due to rising wage rates, along with the payment of salaries and allowances for State Authority staff and members. Furthermore, the perspective plan should assess funding needs for activities under Sub-Rules 5(2) and 5(3), as well as non-recurring andrecurring expenses of the State Authority, such as office management, procurement of equipment, leasing of buildings, staff vehicles, and other necessary activities.

   3. **: Creation of Advance Nurseries:** The States/ Union Territories in the mountainous temperate Region viz. Himalayan landscape, where saplings are required to be kept in nurseries for multiple years i.e. around 3 years or more to achieve suitable size for plantation, the provision can be made in the interest portion for maintaining a sufficient stock of saplings in perpetuity. These saplings from such nurseries can meet immediate requirement of CA and ANR plantations in future by making appropriate accounting adjustment. Like-wise, such advance nurseries can be created and maintained for having a pool of tall/ plantation ready saplings in other parts of the country.

\*\*\*

      6) On transfer of the executive and supervisory staff, the afforestation site should be properly handed over to the successor official with proper records and observations along with the records.  
      7) There has to be proper internal monitoring mechanism for monitoring and evaluation of compensatory afforestation and other activities. It has to be ensured that monitoring and evaluation, apart from survival percentage and growth statistics also includes suitable criteria and indicators for measuring the process of ecological restoration such as growthpattern of local species, enhancement of biodiversity, improvement in soil productivity and moisture regime, vegetation structure and composition, etc.  
      8) Internal Monitoring should be done by the official other than those of implementing Forest Division at the peer Group level and at the State level. The Range of inspection and verification at various level should be specified as per State’s Norms. However, a minimum of 50 % of the work should be verified by the concerned Divisional Forest Officer at the peer group level.  
      9) The calendar of monitoring and evaluation should be prepared well in advance. The Internal Monitoring should be done annually by the officials independent of the team, which has implemented the works.

      10) Third-party monitoring and evaluation is to be done regularly and periodically by selecting suitable agencies/ institutions having desired professional expertise in the field selected after due process. The monitoring reports of Internal and Third Party monitoring and evaluation should be uploaded on digital platform.  
      11) The monitoring reports should not only reflect the objective assessment of the afforestation efforts, but also the constraints, shortcomings, gaps in implementation alongwith recommendations and suggestions to address them timely.

      12) The monitoring process should also comment on the measures taken on the previous recommendations of various monitoring committees.

      13) The report on Internal as well as Third Party Monitoring to be sent timely to the National Authority and Monitoring Group of the National Authority.
