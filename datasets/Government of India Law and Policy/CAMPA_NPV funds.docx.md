**Sub: Perspective plan for utilisation of NPV funds for improvement of forests and wildlife habitat. Reg**

Sir/Madam,

The 22nd meeting of the Executive Committee of National Authority was held on 31st March, 2023, wherein the issue of utilisation of NPV was deliberated at length. It has been reiterated that CAMPA funds are an additional fund for compensating the loss of forest land and ecosystem services due to diversion of forest lands for non-forestry purposes and are not supposed to replace normal State funds. The protection of forests and wildlife, creation/ strengthening of forest related infrastructure, human-wildlife conflict mitigation and other ancillary activities are primary responsibility of the State/ UTs concerned and are required to be supported through State and other funds viz. State Plan, CSS etc. Therefore, the States/UTs CAMPA authorities should propose funding of routine protection and forest management activities from CAMPA as a matter of exception and only after giving adequate justification.

2. CAMPA funds are to be utilised for undertaking regeneration (both artificial and assisted natural regeneration) to compensate the loss of forest and create/enrich more forests, for improvement in quality of forests and the wildlife habitat including augmentation of fodder and water for wildlife. Whereas, CA funds are site-specific and mandatory for raising of compensatory afforestation, NPV funds are meant for improving the quality of forest cover, conservation of biodiversity and enhancement of ecosystem services. Instances have come to notice that the activities of routine nature are proposed from the NPV head. Forest/Wildlife Protection Force/Mobile Squad is routinely proposed for funding under CAMPA, which is primarily the responsibility of State Government/UT Administration. The NPV amount available with most of the States is limited and is likely to be exhausted if used without due diligence and proper planning.

3. The permissible items of works/activities are provided in CAF Rules, 2018\. The National Authority has been giving guidelines/instructions from time to time in various meetings of the Executive Committee and the Governing Body for giving priority to afforestation, forest conservation & restoration activities including soil and water conservation. As a principle at least 80% of the NPV funds should be utilised for the purpose of forest regeneration and improvement in quality of forest and maximum of 20% only be used for essential infrastructure support and capacity building that has direct impact on extension and improvement of forest cover and wildlife habitat.

4. Use of CAMPA funds for Van Mahotsav, publicity for public awareness and community engagement for forest protection, capacity building of field staff etc. should be linked to forest regeneration and improvement in quality of forest/wildlife habitat in area tenns. Area (in Ha) should be the monitorable parameter for these activities and correct geo-coordinates (polygons) of treated sites should be uploaded one-Green watch portal.

5. For improvement of wildlife habitat, CAMPA fund is to be utilized for planting locally suitable plant and trees for enriching fodder and fruit bearing trees, grasses, soil and moisture conservation and control of invasive weed species etc. Fencing and construction of essential protection infrastructure, if required in exceptional circumstances may be done under CAMPA fund by using locally available eco-friendly materials and only after assessing sites specific requirement.

6. The digitisation of forest boundaries and consolidation of forest land should be accorded high priorities. In this regard, States should focus on timely completion of survey, demarcation and digitisation of forest boundaries.

7. All major activities in Protected Areas should be part of approved Wildlife Management Plan. The wildlife species-based conservation activities are to be proposed in the sanctuaries.

8. The soil and water conservation should be carried out scientifically from ridge to valley approach. It has been observed that in a number of State APOs, unifonn structure with identical physical and financial outlays are proposed which are expected to include site specific requirement of appropriate dimension as per topological requirement in the field indicated with correct geo-referenced location on the attached /annexed map.

9. During afforestation and ANR works locally suitable plant and tree species should be planted with adequate care and protection in accordance with working plan prescriptions including, soil moisture activities and root stocks treatment for creating conducive environment for natural regeneration.

I0. Improvement of forest roads should be done from State Funds other than CAMPA Funds.

11. In view of above points, it was decided that all States/UTs should have a perspective plan fo, r utilization of NPV from where the APO should include a subset of the yearly activities.

12. While preparing APOs first charge should be given for meeting cost of committed liabilities

i.e. maintenance of ANR/ Plantation and completion of spill over works of previous financial years.

Therefore, NPV allocations are required to be rationalised to around 20% of total NPV funds available with the State/UT during the financial year 2023-2024. In case, states have some genuine issues while implementing ongoing CAMPA activities, they may write to the National Authority, CAMPA, for supplementary requirement giving due justification.

Yours faithfully,
