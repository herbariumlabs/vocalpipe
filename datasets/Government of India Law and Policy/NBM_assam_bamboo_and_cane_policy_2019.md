  The Assam Bamboo and Cane Policy, 2019

  State Bamboo Development Agency

  Industries and Commerce Department Government of Assam

Preamble:

  Bamboo has been an integral part of the cultural, social and economic traditions of the state of Assam. It is a renewable and versatile resource and an important component of the wealth of Assam. It grows in the natural forests and is cultivated in homesteads, groves and on private plantations. The important characteristics that make Bamboo so useful are- (i) It has a short growth cycle which makes it highly renewable (ii) Different parts of the plant have different uses and are obtained at different stages of its growth thus rendering the plant useful during its entire life span (iii) Bamboo shoots of some species are edible and have high nutritional value (iv) The plant improves the environment in many significant ways including acting as an atmospheric and soil purifier. (v) It is hardy, light and flexible, thus a good substitute for wood (vi) In the hilly and mountainous areas as well as riverbanks elsewhere it protects the slopes from erosion as an effective soil binder. (vii) Bamboo forests are also home to many endangered wildlife including a large number of birds. For the Wild elephants, endangered Hollock Gibbons and some other fauna, it forms a major part of their diet.

  Statistics reveals that the NER constitutes as much as more than 60% of the country‟s growing stock of bamboo and Assam is one of the major source of both naturally and home grown bamboo in the entire North East Region. This bamboo sector if harnessed properly has the potential to generate ample employment and revenue.

  The Government of Assam too felt the importance of the sector and its potential for employment creation and livelihood generation and the new “State Bamboo and Cane Policy2019”‟is a reflection of that endeavour.

The Vision- Bamboo and Cane(Rattan):

  The Government of Assam will encourage, promote and support the Bamboo sector in a comprehensive manner through a multidisciplinary, multidepartment and multi- dimensional integrated approach to provide economic benefits to the people of the State apart from realizing the social and environmental potential of the bamboo resource of Assam.

  The Government of Assam will promote and support the Cane (Rattan) sector through a programme of conservation and development of rattan resources of the States and through support to the craft and small enterprises involved in cane (rattan) sector. The Government shall also encourage value addition in cane (rattan) based handicrafts through improved processing, product diversification, design development and enhanced shelf life.

Aim and objectives:

  Broadly the policy aims at sustainable development and utilization of bamboo and Cane resources in the State through scientific management and stakeholders‟ participation. More specifically, the policy aims at:

1.  Protection and conservation of biodiversity associated with bamboo and Cane forests and bamboo growing areas.

2.  Enhancement of resources through promotion of bamboo and Cane plantation in forest areas, wastelands as well as in private lands and through it‟s sustainable and scientific harvesting.

3.  Improvement of productivity by use of improved planting stock and scientific management practices.

4.  Promotion of bamboo based industries at cottage, small, medium and large scale levels for utilizing the available resources at a sustainable level and towards generating assured income. Cane based industries will also be promoted.

5.  Revival and promotion of traditional sector for producing handicrafts and other value added items. Promotion of product diversification and value addition in the organized sector.

6.  Enhancing employment opportunity and livelihood security of the bamboo and Cane dependents at all levels through assured supply of raw materials and establishment of appropriate institutions.

7.  Improvement and promotion of traditional bamboo houses and establishment of modern bamboo houses, thereby reducing pressure on forest wood

8.  Use of bamboo and Cane for environmental protection, greening up of degraded lands and other diversified activities such as watershed protection and river banks and as geo material in construction of roads and bridges.

9.  To promote skill development, capacity building, awareness generation for development of bamboo sector from production to market demand.

10. Development of effective marketing for Bamboo and Cane based products.

Approach:

  The approach of the policy in achieving the above mentioned objectives would be based on the following :

1)  Community and private individuals participation along with the various departments in bamboo and Cane development

2)  Support to activities focussed on conservation of bamboo and Cane resource

3)  Plant propagation.

4)  Enhancement of the production base

5)  Management Information System (MIS), inventory and database development

6)  Promotion of handicrafts for Cane and Bamboo

7)  Promotion of furniture making for Cane and bamboo

8)  Industrial utilisation and entrepreneurship development for Bamboo sector

9)  Use of Bamboo and Cane for soil erosion prevention and for the reclamation of waste lands

10) Bamboo utilisation in building material and low cost housing

Strategies :

  The strategies will be as follows:-

Conservation of the resource

a)  Providing better source of income generation through cultivation of Bamboo & Cane and sustainable harvest will definitely pave the way for conservation of the vast resource.

b)  Covering maximum area under plantation programme, preferably with superior species having wider uses like Bambusa tulda , Bambusa balcoa and Calamus rotang.

c)  Introduction of high yielding varieties for commercial cultivation after proper Research & Development by appropriate Government Agencies.

d)  A Bambusetum, which would contain a live collection of different bamboo species, would also be established within the next 2-3 years, to enable local artisans, bamboo growers and farmers to get first hand information about morphological features, aesthetic properties and growth characteristics of these plants. Information systems would be put into place for all to be made aware of this facility and to encourage overall and specific varieties‟ usage.

Plant propagation

  Plant propagation is essential as there is shortage of bamboo planting material for large scale cultivation

a)  Existing use of rhizome as planting material will be continued as the rural masses are using this method traditionally and have the expertise but only rhizomes that are 1.5-2 years old can be used for propagation. Hence, alternative methods of propagation will be explored.

b)  Establishment of Nurseries-A sizable quantity of quality planting material will be required to meet the targets set. Nurseries (Small, Big & High-tech) shall be established in public & private sector. Tissue culture raised planting materials of superior germ plasm should be resorted to wherever required to ensure quality and productivity.. Vigil will be kept on incidences of bamboo flowering and adequate arrangements will be made for collection and utilization of the seeds as it flowers gregariously. These measures may be through Forest Departments, User Industries, Research Institutions, Universities, Farmers Groups, Self Help Groups, KVKs / NGOs and individual farmer / unemployed youths. Commercial production in private sector shall be encouraged for regular and sustained supply of planting material

  In order to ensure quality of planting material, the Rain Forest Research Institute(RFRI) will be the certifying Agency.

  The types of Nurseries to be established as per National Bamboo Mission Guidelines are:-

i.  Hi Tech Nurseries: For supply of quality planting material in large quantities, which is free from diseases and viruses, Tissue Culture Units shall be set up. Efforts will be made to set up these units in Regional Forest Research Institute, Jorhat & other organisations in private/ public or cooperative sector. Tissue culture Units would be set up under the close supervision and technical support from RFRI. Each nursery shall produce a minimum of 50,000 nos. of sapling/ seedlings per ha per year of mandated species duly certified for its quality. Nursery should have own composting unit, drip irrigation system and green house /shade/mist chamber for temperature regulation. It should have its own tissue culture lab or tie up with accredited tissue culture lab.

ii. Big Nursery: Each nursery shall produce a minimum of 25,000 nos. of sapling/ seedlings per ha per year of mandated species duly certified for its quality.

  Nursery should have own composting unit, proper source of certified seeds/propagule/ irrigation system and green house /shade/mist chamber

iii. Small Nursery: Each nursery shall produce a minimum of 16,000 nos. of sapling/ seedlings per year of mandated species duly certified for its quality. Nursery should have own composting unit, and proper source of certified seeds/propagules.

  The departments like Forest, Panchayat and Rural Development and Agriculture having permanent Nurseries will also be approached for increasing the production of saplings.

  Rattan is mainly propagated through seeds. Both the Govt Agencies and Departments and private parties will be approached for providing certified saplings. Tissue culture is also an option. Facilities in RFRI and Assam Agriculture University will be explored for Cane propagation.

Plantation:

  Plantation can be carried out either in Forest land or Non- Forest land. The Forest Department will carry out the plantations inside the Forest area through their own schemes. The sustainable harvesting shall be done as per the Working Plan. The nearby Joint Forest Management Committees shall also be involved in plantation and harvesting activities.

  The State will mainly focus on plantation outside the Forest area. For Bamboo, new plantations can be raised either in Government/Panchayat/ community land including waste lands or in Farmers field either as block plantations or in their homestead gardens. The identification of land is a pre-requisite for raising new plantations. The State Bamboo Development Agency will advertise from time to time regarding the requisite of areas for the plantation. The preference will be given to individual Farmers, Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs), Village Producers' Organizations (VPOs), Self Help Groups (SHGs) and the like. All plantations are to be geo- referenced.

  The provisions under National Bamboo Mission are as follows:-

i)  High density plantations: The species to be planted would be as per the approved plan. Certified planting material to be used so as to ensure quality and high yields. Maintenance funds in subsequent 2 years shall be linked to survival percentage - minimum 80% after 1^(st)year and 100% after 2^(nd)year, with replacementsaplingsofthesameageasthatoftheremainingsurvivingones.

Block plantation/boundary plantations on farmers’ fields: Expected

  numbers would be 375-450 plants per ha at least. It should be ensured that certified planting material of desired species is provided to the farmers along with proper agronomic practices so as to maximize overall returns from bamboo + agricultural crops. Maintenance in subsequent 2 years shall be linked to survival percentage- minimum 80% after 1^(st)year and 100% after 2^(nd)year, with replacement saplings of the same age as that of the remaining surviving ones.

  Free sapling distribution will also be arranged amongst the farmers who will be going for plantation in the area less than 0.5 Ha.

  Cane can be preferred for reclamation of wastelands. Since, it‟s a thorny species, it is generally not preferred in homestead gardens.

Transfer of Technology:

  Transfer of technology through training, frontline demonstration, publicity and training of the trainers are an integral part of the Policy. Under this programme, skill development / training of farmers, field level workers and Entrepreneurs will be taken up. Appropriate training is required to be imparted to the farmers for the adoption of scientific measures (pre and post harvest management) for high yielding plantations of bamboo and harvesting as per respective end utilization. These important activities are to provide resource material to the trainees and acquaint them with various farming techniques through exhibitions and demonstrations. This activity will be carried out both by the government as well as private sector and NGOs in accordance with the

  National Skill Qualifications Framework (NSQF) and respective Sector Skill Councils. Training to bamboo farmers on scientific harvesting of bamboos and bamboo shoots will also be encouraged.

Post-harvest storage and treatment facilities:

  Bamboo is affected by several insects and fungi during growth, storage and after product manufacture. Preventive and remedial measures employing physical, chemical and biological techniques are available. Integrated pest management is suggested for managing these problems. Raw bamboo falls in class-III (non-durable category) .However, with technology developed so far, its durability can be increased beyond 50 years if treated with preservatives. Pre-harvest and post-harvest treatments are effective in reducing damage by fungi and insects. Several preservatives have been developed and commercialized. It is also possible to treat bamboo with fire retardant chemicals but the cost is generally high. Finding a suitable and cost-effective treatment for protection against biodegradation and fire needs further research. The processes leading to engineered bamboo products also protect it against biodegradation. Once the bamboo crop is harvested from the field, it is required to be transported safely and stored properly. For this purpose, suitable warehouses need to be constructed near the villages. While storing the produce, it needs to be treated to enhance its durability.

  Establishment of primary processing units close to the production area is imperative to reduce transportation costs, utilize the entire bamboo to move towards zero wastage and improve economies. Dovetailed will be the micro/medium processing units so as to improve livelihoods of the local communities through upgradation of traditional artisanship and introduction of new skills.

  Bamboo Market Research is essential for assessing the needs, requirements and profitability of low and medium value bamboo products that are being made. This market survey, apart from estimating the demand supply chain and present players and future demands, will also highlight how bamboo products will have to be positioned and the market entry strategy thereby indicating pricing, supply position and branding. This project based activity would be done by the NBM/ BTSG‟s directly through a suitable Agency to be identified, after floating tenders and assistance will be 100%.

  Incubation Centre is drawn from a similar scheme of the Ministry of MSME and similar norms and processes will be followed.

Encouragement of Bamboo entrepreneurs

a)  Small and medium scale industries would be promoted through entrepreneurship development and by providing appropriate incentives and linkages with appropriate agencies such as the Indian Plywood Industries Research & Training Institute (IPIRT, Bangalore), Building Material & Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC, New Delhi), NECTER, Shillong, TIFAC, Bamboo Technology Centre, Guwahati, Assam North East Bamboo Development Council, etc.

b)  A Diagnostic Study and Revival Plan of the existing sick as well as closed units would be done. The closed plywood industries of Assam would also be explored for converting the same to bamboo processing areas.

c)  Appropriate funding mechanism would be established under the aegis of North East Development and Financial Institutions (NEDFI), AIDC, KVIC, Assam Gramin Vikash Bank etc.

d)  Bamboo utilization in bulk sectoral uses of agarbati sticks, fishing rods and umbrella handles and other export applications, would be promoted through market linkages and appropriate incentives.

e)  Use of bamboo housing particularly in rural areas would be promoted through appropriate standardisation of species, grouping and preservation techniques/processes for different structural elements to make it a fire resistant, durable and tough building material under local conditions. International Network of Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR) would be associated for a project on low cost bamboo- based housing.

f)  Bamboo Processing Zones (BPZ) are to be set up at identified locations where the facilities from primary processing stage to manufacture of value added finished products would be made.

g)  Facilities for bamboo quality verification and testing would be developed at all CFCs along with appropriate processing and treatment facilities for value addition. A system of certification would be put up in place to promote sustainable improved quality material in order to meet the buyer needs.

h)  Local talent for product design, development and diversification would be promoted by providing regular tie up with market and design institutes such as National Institute of Design (NID, Ahmedabad, Jorhat) and other agencies. An extension/exchange based program would be structured for ongoing inputs into the design process involving artisans.

i)  Market Research which is targeted towards working backward and forward linkages would be conducted.

j)  Tie up with Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), Diploma Institutions and Engineering Colleges for introduction of bamboo and cane technology subjects in the curriculum to provide technical manpower required for the sector.

k)  Promotional activity to build the market, to create awareness about bamboo wood timber shall be made by way of News Paper Advt., Hoardings, audio-visual aids etc. Also bamboo product showrooms at high footfall areas like Railway Stations, Airports etc. Also efforts shall be launched for developing the necessary market mechanism with support towards promotion and marketing of finished products, participation in exhibitions to artisans.

l)  Interactive workshops, buyers-sellers meets, preparation/updation of catalogues and showcasing of products and capabilities would be promoted. Support from the organizations such as National Informatics Centre (NIC) would be sought whose Community Information Centre program will help increase the reach of learning materials through the web. Various digital media could be leveraged for providing training as well marketing of the products.

m)  Government would actively consider the use of value added bamboo products for its own requirements and programmes. This will motivate the people to use bamboo as a wood substitute. Bamboo housing would be promoted through District Rural Development Agencies (DRVs), Rural Development Deptt. and other similar agencies.

n)  Handholding support to be provided to the Entrepreneurs right from the availability of quality raw materials, their Primary Processing, land and other infrastructures, encouraging of handicrafts though improved processing, product diversification, design development and enhanced shelf life, to produce quality products at par with international standards and to increase the trade in home and export. Free toolkit & training to the needy local artisans to be arranged.

o)  Appropriate funding mechanisms would be established under the aegis of North East Development and Financial Institution (NEDFI),which has a mandate to perform this task in the North East. Banks will also be approached for providing “Green Loan”

p)  If possible, International organizations/ Foreign countries will be approached for funding in Cane and Bamboo sector.
