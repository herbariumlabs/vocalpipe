# PRICE SUPPORT SCHEME (PSS): THE OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES

**CHAPTER – I INTRODUCTION**

Assurance of a remunerative and stable price environment for growers/farmers is very important for increasing agricultural production and productivity. The market price for agricultural produce many times tends to be unstable and volatile which may result into undue losses to the growers and discourage adoption of the modern technology and required inputs.

The Government’s price policy for agricultural commodities seeks to ensure remunerative prices to the growers for their produce with a view to encourage higher investment and production and to safeguard the interest of consumers by making available supplies at reasonable prices with low cost of intermediation. The price policy also seeks to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure in the perspective of the overall needs of the economy.

Towards this end, the Government announces, Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 25 major agricultural commodities each year in both the Crop seasons after taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).

CACP recommends MSP for twenty two (22) crops and Fair & Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane. Apart from Sugarcane for which FRP is declared by the Department of Food &Public Distribution, twenty two crops covered under MSP are Paddy, Jowar, Bajra, Maize, Ragi, Arhar, Moong, Urad, Groundnut-in-shell, Soyabean, Sunflower, Seasamum, Nigerseed, Cotton, Wheat, Barley, Gram, Masur (lentil), Rapeseed/Mustardseed, Safflower, Jute and Copra.

In addition, MSP for Toria and De-Husked coconut is fixed by the Department on the basis of MSP’s of Rapeseed/Mustardseed and Copra respectively.

Besides, announcement of MSP, the Government also organizes procurement operations of these agricultural commodities through various public and cooperative agencies such as Food Corporation of India (FCI), Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), Jute Corporation of India (JCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC), National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED), National Consumer Cooperative Federation of India Ltd. (NCCF), and Small Farmers Agro Consortium (SFAC). Besides, State Governments also appoint state agencies to undertake PSS operations.

While deciding the MSP for various agricultural commodities, the recommendations of CACP, the views of Central Ministries and State Governments and such other relevant factors which are important in the opinion of the Government are considered. The CACP, while recommending the Minimum Support Price keeps in view (i) the need to provide incentives to the producers for adopting improved technology and for developing a production pattern broadly in the light of national requirements (ii) the need to ensure rational utilization of land, water and other production resources and (iii) the likely effect of the price policy on the rest of the economy, particularly, on the cost of living, level of wages, industrial cost structure etc.

NAFED, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC)National Consumer Cooperative Federation of India Ltd. (NCCF), Small Farmers Agro Consortium (SFAC) are the central agenciesfor procurement of oilseeds & pulses. However, NAFED is also an additional central agency for procurement of cotton, in addition to Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) under theDAC.

The cost of cultivation/production includes all paid out costs, such as, those incurred on account of hired human labour, bullock labour/machine labour (both hired and owned) and rent paid for leased in land besides cash and kind expenses on use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges including cost of diesel/electricity for operation of pump sets, etc. Besides, cost of production includes imputed value of wages of family labour and rent for owned land. The cost also covers depreciation of farm machinery and buildings, transportation and insurance charges. As such, the cost of production covers not only actual expenses in cash and kind but also imputed value of owned assets, land and family labour.

## NECESSITY FOR FRAMING OF PSS GUIDELINES:

Although the Price Support Scheme is in existence for more than 3 decades, there are no guidelines at present to regulate PSS operation. Experience in implementing the PSS over the years has shown the necessity to prepare comprehensive guidelines for effective implementation of the scheme to ensure that the farmers are benefited and to put in place a system of efficient marketing, development of non-traditional/new markets, processing of agricultural produce for value addition and the sales through network of retail points.
