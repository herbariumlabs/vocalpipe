Computerisation of PACS

  Posted On: 19 DEC 2023 6:36PM by PIB Delhi

  []In order to strengthen Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), the project for Computerization of 63,000 functional PACS with a total financial outlay of ₹2,516 Crore has been approved by the Government of India, which entails bringing all the functional PACS onto an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) based common national software, linking them with NABARD through State Cooperative Banks (StCBs) and District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs). Out of the total budget of Rs. 2,516 crore for the project, the shares of Government of India (GoI), State Governments and NABARD are Rs. 1528 crore, Rs. 736 crore and Rs. 252 crore, respectively.

  So far, proposals for computerization of 62,318 PACS from 28 States/ UTs have been sanctioned, for which Rs. 475.55 Cr. has been released as GoI share to the States/UTs concerned. The proposed revised estimate of GoI share for financial year 2023-24 is Rs. 350 Cr. which can be released to States/UTs & NABARD after utilization of funds released earlier to them. Details of number of PACS sanctioned and GoI share released till date to States/UTs are enclosed as Annexure.

  The National Level Common Software for the project has been developed by NABARD and ERP trial run has started in 5,673 PACS in 26 States/ UTs so far. Hardware procurement and digitization of legacy data by the States and Union Territories are under process.

  Implementation of Common Accounting System (CAS) and Management Information System (MIS) at PACS level under this project would improve governance and transparency in PACS, thus leading to speedy disbursal of loans, lowering of transaction cost, reduction in imbalances in payments, seamless accounting with DCCBs and StCBs and will also increase efficiency. It will enhance trustworthiness in the working of PACS among farmers, thus contributing towards realizing the vision of “Sahakar se Samridhi”.

  Computerization of PACS project will provide a comprehensive ERP solution for all the economic activities prescribed under the Model Byelaws for PACS covering various modules such as financial services for short, medium & long term loans, procurement operations, Public Distribution Shops (PDS) operations, business planning, warehousing, merchandising, borrowings, asset management, human resource management, etc

  The project will improve farmers access to short-term, medium-term and long-term credit. In addition, through inclusion of different modules for various economic activities, as mentioned under Model Byelaws for PACS, computerization will also enable farmers to obtain these services at PACS level itself. It will also help in diversification of PACS economic activities, thus enabling the farmer members to get additional & sustainable sources of income.
