The DAO will monitor at least 5% of the total completed units and will submit the report to this Directorate, based on which the fund will be released by means of DBT to the beneficiaries accounts. The format is enclosed herewith for necessary action in connection with completion certificate of the pending vermin compost unit under MOVCD. You are requested to arrange for completion of vermin compost units construction by the fam1ers for entire 500 nos. of each MOVCD clusters.
