5. #### **PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL AND IMPLEMENTATION**

   **STRATEGY AND ROADMAP**

   1. States will prepare the existing perspective/strategic plan and road map for overall development of horticulture crops including Bamboo in respective state, duly projecting the targets to be achieved during the XII Plan period. This will form the basis for preparing Annual Action Plan (AAP). The Strategy & Road Map formulated by States should invariably contain information on geography & climate, potential of horticulture/bamboo development, availability of land, SWOC analysis, strategy for development and plan of action proposed to be taken to achieve goals in each district of the State. The document should focus on crops having comparative advantage and natural potential for development in the State, adoption of cluster approach for production and linking with available infrastructure, or to be created, for post harvest management, processing, marketing and export. While selecting the cluster, preference should be given to those areas where natural resource base and water resources have been developed under watershed

      development programmes, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), etc. Priority should be given for development of such crops, which are required to meet current and future demands.

      **ANNUAL ACTION PLAN**

   2. In this context, AAP needs to be supported with data/write up on outcome of past interventions covering the details of area expansion (variety/species introduced, increase in productivity achieved and number of clusters created), water resource development as per felt need of the State (amount of irrigation potential created, whether linked with micro irrigation, maintenance etc), INM/IPM (including requisite infrastructure created and how these are being utilized for benefit of farmers) and organic farming. Area expansion should be determined based on availability of planting material and a seed/planting material sub-plan shall be prepared separately as part of AAP.

   3. Ministry of Agriculture will communicate the tentative outlay for the year to each State / NLA, which in turn will indicate sector-wise/district-wise allocation. Agencies at District level will prepare AAP keeping in view their priority and potential and submit the plan to State Horticulture/Bamboo Mission within the allocated sum. The States may engage TSG/Consultancy services for preparation of Perspective/Strategic/Annual Action Plans. State Horticulture/ Bamboo Mission in turn will prepare a consolidated proposal for State as a whole, get it vetted by the respective State Level Executive Committee (SLEC) and furnish the same, including copy in electronic format, to Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) for consideration by National Level Executive Committee (EC). All issues relating to horticultural/Bamboo development, covering production, post harvest management and marketing will be covered by SHMs/SBDAs. Formats for submission of Annual Action Plan to DAC are specified in **Annexure IV (a) & (b)**.

4. While finalizing the AAPs, due attention will be paid for earmarking specific targets for Scheduled Caste,

   Scheduled Tribe and women beneficiaries. As an inbuilt provision under MIDH scheme, higher rates of subsidy have been envisaged for taking up activities like creation of infrastructure for post harvest

   management and marketing of horticulture produce along with area expansion by beneficiaries in the North Eastern States, Himalayan States, Tribal Sub Plan areas, Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands.

6. #### **FUND FLOW MECHANISM** {#fund-flow-mechanism}

   1. Flow of funds and the utilization by the Implementing Agencies / SHMs / SBDA/ NLAs / PRIs etc from Government of India and utilization of funds shall be governed by extant financial norms. Funds will be released to the State Governments. State Government will release funds to the SHMs / State Level

      Implementing Agencies, who in turn would make funds available to DMC/ District Implementing Agency. As far as possible, efforts to make on-line payment to all Implementing Agencies would be ensured, which in turn will make arrangements for making payment to beneficiaries through electronic transfer, preferably to their respective bank accounts. Flow chart for release of funds under MIDH is given below

| State Govt., NHM States \+15% to SHM States |  |  |  |  |
| :---: | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

|  |  |  |

   2. Implementing agencies would be required to undertake activities within the funds released by the GOI and corresponding state share in respect of NHM. No claims of pending liabilities relating to expenditure over and above released funds will be entertained by DAC.

7. #### **MISSION INTERVENTIONS** {#mission-interventions}

   1. The Mission will be demand and need based in each segment. Technology will play an important role in different interventions. Technologies such as Information Communication Technology (ICT), Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System will be widely used for planning and monitoring purposes including identification of sites for creating infrastructure facilities for post harvest management, markets and production forecasts.

   2. The interventions envisaged for achieving desired goals would be varied and regionally differentiated with focus on potential crops to be developed in clusters by deploying modern and hi-tech interventions, duly ensuring backward and forward linkages. Revised cost norms and pattern of assistance, as given in

      **Annexure-V to VIII**, will be adopted. Detailed guidelines in respect of NHB, CDB and CIH schemes, including modalities of approval of projects will be issued separately for effective implementation of these schemes
