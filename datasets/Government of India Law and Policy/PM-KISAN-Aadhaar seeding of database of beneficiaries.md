  Subject: Aadhaar seeding of database of beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Klsan

  $Amman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme - regarding Madam/ Sir,

  The Government has amended para 8.1 of the Operational Guidelines of the PM-Kisan Scheme providing for relaxation of mandatory Aadhaar seeding of database before release of second installment. However, availability of Aadhaar number is mandatory. A copy of the amended para 8.1 is annexed, which has also been uploaded on the PM-Kisan Portal.

2.  Many States like Bihar, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are already providing data which is Aadhaar authenticated. Therefore, it is imperative that other States also undertake an

  exercise in earnest for Aaoh,&.9r authentication using technology and the platform and facilities already available in this respect. In the interest of the scheme and authenticity of the

  beneficiary data provided by the State Governments, it will be appropriate that the State Governments may simultaneously undertake the following exercise:-

(i) The name of the beneficiary should be the same as that provided in the Aadhaar card the details of which have also been collected so that the Aadhaar authentication through demographic information is successful for majority of the beneficiaries.

(ii) The UIDAI may facilitate making available its authentication platform to the State Governments to undertake Aadhaar authentication. This exercise may start immediately by the State Governments for those beneficiaries who have been provided first installment.

(iii) Aadhaar authentication can happen through demographic and biometric authentication process. In the first stage the State may undertake demographic authentication using UIDAI facility which may possibly lead to authentication of Aadhaar numbers of 40 to 50% beneficiaries (as names may not match exactly).

,,._

(iv) Efforts may also be made to undertake an exercise wherein the Aadhaar number as provided in the beneficiary database match with Aadhaar number which has been seeded with the beneficiary bank accounts. Since a large share of the beneficiary bank accounts are Aadhaar seeded, it may also lead to Aadhaar matching of database to confirm that Aadhaar number is same as that seeded in the account number for the beneficiaries which has already been verified by the State Governments.

(v) For those beneficiaries where Aadhaar is still not authenticated, they may have to undertake biometric authentication at nearest CSC centres to complete the authentication process. Possibly there are agencies authorized by UIDAI who can undertake Aadhaar authentication of beneficiaries going house to house after payment of a fee. This possibility can also be explored by States and funds required may be spent by State Governments as part of administrative expenses.

(vi) The details of the PFMS report are being shared with the State Governments. The State Governments should compare the names of the beneficiaries as provided by them and the names of the beneficiaries as mentioned in the PFMS account details. The payments of those beneficiaries where there is a discrepancy will be withheld up to the time this discrepancy is resolved by the field level functionaries.

3.  The States are advised to make all efforts for Aadhaar seeding of database so that when the third installment becomes due the entire data base is Aadhaar seeded.

Yours sincerely,

  AMENDMENT TO PARA 8.1 OF OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES OF PM-KISAN SCHEME (AS ON 11.03.2019)

  Para 8.1 of the Operational Guidelines of PM-Kisan Scheme have further been amended and shall be read·as follows:

  "The Scheme shall be implemented through an Aadhaar linked electronic data base containing details of all members of the Small and Marginal landholder farmers whose names appear in the land records. For transfer of the first installment of financial benefits to the eligible farmers, Aadhaar number shall be collected for those beneficiaries where it is available and for others alternate prescribed documents can be collected for identity verification purposes. It is to be ensured that all such beneficiaries shall have to be compulsorily enrolled under Aadhaar, since payment of third installment onwards shall be done only on the basis of Aadhaar seeded data base. However, Aadhaar number shall be compulsory for release of second Installment onwards. States / UTs shall ensure that there is no duplication of the payment transferred to eligible families.

  The funds pertaining to income support benefit as well as administrative charges shall be released from Government of India to the States' designated account/mechanism. The benefit shall be transferred by Government of India to the beneficiaries through a mechanism wherein district wise beneficiaries' lists shall be certified and uploaded by the States/UTs and the funds will be electronically transferred via State Notional Account (similar to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS)] to the beneficiaries' bank account on the basis of their account numbers and IFSC code. However, where the states verify that Aadhaar linked accounts are not the loan accounts of beneficiaries, the Aadhaar linked payment system can be adopted. For ease of implementation the States may consider assigning the job of sponsoring bank for the scheme to the same bank being used by concerned State for MGNREGS."
