Govt. of India is committed to promote Organic Farming to ensure sustainable productivity, food security and enhancement of soil health, Government is being promoted through dedicated schemes **i.e. Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER)** since 2015.

1.  Paramparagat **Krishi Vikas** Yojana **(PKVY)**

The PKW Scheme is implemented in a cluster mode with min. 20 ha size and states have been asked to implement in cluster size of 1000 ha in plain area and 500 ha in hilly area to facilitate marketing of organic produce. All farmers are eligible but within a group a farmer can avail benefit up to a maximum of 2 ha. and the limit of assistance is Rs.50, 000 per hac., out of which 62% i.e., Rs. 31,000 is given as incentives to farmer for organic conversion, organic inputs, on farm inputs, production infrastructure, etc., provided directly through DBT during the conversion peilod of 3 years.

**Objectives**

1.  To promote natural resource based integrated and climate resilient sustainable farming systems that ensure maintenance and increase of soil fertility, natural resource conservation, on-farm nutrient recycling and minimize dependence of farmers on external inputs;
2.  To reduce cost of agriculture to farmers through sustainable integrated

organic farming systems thereby enhancing farmer's net income per unit of land.

1.  To sustainably produce chemical free and nutritious food for human consumption.
2.  To protect environment from hazardous inorganic chemicals by adoption of eco-friendly low-cost traditional techniques and farmer friendly technologies.
3.  To empower farmers through their own institutional development in the form of clusters and groups with capacity to manage production, processing, value addition and certification management;
4.  To make farmers entrepreneurs through direct market linkages with local and national markets

Funding pattern: PKVY is a centrally sponsored scheme with the funding pattern of 90:10 in hilly states, 100% central share for UTs and for remaining states central and state Govt share in a ratio of 60:40

## How to avail the benefits and join the scheme

Farmers interested for adoption of organic farming as long term goal can contact Director of Agriculture at state level and District Agriculture office of at local level. Under Namami Gange Programme, 5 km belt along the river Ganges is also targeted for organic conversion. Farmers in these area is also can contact their District Agriculture office.

*   1.  Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Paddhti (BPKP):

BPKP scheme, a sub -scheme of PKVY have been promoting traditional indigenous practices which gives freedom to farmers from externally purchased inputs and largely based on on -farm biomass recycling with major stress on biomass mulching, use of cow dung -urine formulations; and other plant based prep arations.

| Component | Rs/ha for 3years | Cost per clusterof 20 ha Rs |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Total | 12,200/ha | 2,44,000 |

*   1.  Large Area Certification (LAC)

Under PKVY - LAC schemes, states can transform their large contiguous traditional/ default organic areas (such as tribal areas, hill districts) into certified organic through PGS -India Certification. In this large contiguous areas with no agro -chemical inpu ts usages history can be transformed into certified using one village one group concept. Under this component financial assistance is available only for certification facilitation @ Rs 2700/ha for 3 years.

1.  **Mission Organic Value Chain** Development for North Eastern **Region (MOVCDNER)**

For promotion of certified organic farming for development of domestic and export market of organic produce, Government of India have launched MOVCDNER schemes in North Eastern States to help farmers to develop value chains of production, processing, certification and marketing through FPO/FPC formation.

Objectives

The scheme aims at development of commodity specific, concentrated, certified organic production clusters in value chain mode to link growers with consumers and to support the development of entire value chain starting from inputs, seeds, certification, to the creation of facilities for collection, aggregation, processing, marketing and brand building initiative. The main focus of the scheme is on export of produce. The scheme was approved with an outlay of Rs. 400 crore for three years during the year 2015 -16. The scheme has completed two phases of three years each and is now moving forward in Phase III.
