1.  The Union Cabinet has approved Digital Agriculture Mission on 2nd September 2024. Agri Stack, a component of Digital Agriculture Mission, is a farmer-centric Digital Public infrastructure (DPI) being built as a public good like Aadhar for efficient, easier and faster service and scheme delivery to the farmers. It is being built in a federated structure as a collaborative project between the various agencies of the Central and State Governments and the Union Territories. It consists of three foundational registries or databases in the agriculture sector, i.e., the Farmers' Registry, Geo­ referenced village maps and the Crop Sown Registry, all created and maintained by the State Governments/ Union Territories.

2.  Taking this forward, the Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DoA&FW) signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with State Governments, for conducting Digital Crop Surveys, creating Farmer Registries, and including village land maps. In the implementation of DPI for Agriculture, the MoU plays an important role as it outlines Centre and State responsibilities in a collaborative framework under which States are supported with training, technical and financial assistance in the form of Reference Application and funds for building and maintenance of various building blocks of DPI. The Mou also enables a mechanism of aggregate data sharing between the Centre and the State.

3.  Farmer Registry/database is linked dynamically to State Record of Rights (RoR) system. This registry is essential for streamlining government processes pertaining to farmers, enhancing service delivery, and minimizing the duplication of benefits. Each State will maintain its Farmer Registry, the State Farmer Registry, which will include basic data on farmers such as

  The following are critical administrative decisions required to be undertaken by the State Government for successful rollout and implementation of State Farmers Registry.

1.  Policy Decisions: States need to conduct deliberations and establish ground rules, for clear policy decisions and directions on three important aspects of land ownership for the purpose of State Farmer Registry:

Decision on Legal Heirs of Deceased owners:

- How to handle deceased owners? Whether state Government intends to assign land parcels of deceased owner to their legal heirs in the state farmers registry pending mutation in land records? How does State Government identify the legal heirs? What documents to be insisted for the same?

- Would state Government not put legal heirs in State Farmer registry before they are formally updated in ROR? How does State to provide farmer centric benefits to the legal heirs of deceased owners in case as State Government

  does not include them in the State Farmer Registry?

Distribution of Land area in case of Joint Ownership:

- How does State Government intend to distribute the a given plot area among joint owners? Does the state adopt the logic of imputed full or imputed equal?

- Would the State Government like to enable declaration of share by joint owners as imputed equal?

- What are the acceptable documents for updating declared / consented share? In case of imputed full, how would the farmer centric benefits be apportioned among owners?

Farmer benefits during Mutation update process (in-situ):

- Handling buyers who have completed registration and mutation process is in progress. Including statutory notice period, mutation process may take anywhere between 60-75 days. How does buyer avail benefits during this period as agriculture is time critical activity and mutation has not completed and hence farmer registry doesn't have his name.

2.  Intra-State, Inter departmental Coordination: State Government needs to notify a joint committee of seniormost Revenue and Agriculture officials to coordinate and collaborate, on critical needs of decision making in lieu of State Farmer Registry. This
