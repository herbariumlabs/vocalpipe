[][]GREEN BUDGET IN ASSAM

FOR FY 2025-26

  []PREFACE

  Assam, the gateway to Northeast India, is renowned for its vast tea gardens, the mighty Brahmaputra, rich biodiversity, and vibrant cultural heritage. The state is home to 18 wildlife sanctuaries and 7 national parks. Assam’s economy is deeply intertwined with its environment, making it highly vulnerable to climate change. Rising global temperatures have had a severe impact, with Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Adaptation Planning in India using a Common Framework report identifying 25 districts in Assam among the 100 most climate-vulnerable districts in India. The analysis further shows that approximately 90% of districts in Assam have a high level of vulnerability.

  To address these challenges, Assam has implemented robust frameworks, including the State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC), the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Roadmap 2030, the Assam Solar Energy Policy, 2017, and the Assam Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy, 2021, to mitigate environmental risks and promote sustainable development.

  Under the leadership of Hon’ble Chief Minister Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma, Assam has taken significant steps to integrate climate action into its financial planning. Assam was the third state in India and the first in the Northeast to introduce Climate Budget Tagging in FY 2023-24, with other states following suit. The Green Budget serves as a critical tool to align government spending with climate and environmental sustainability goals.

  As a result of these concerted efforts, Assam’s Green Budget has seen steady growth. This year, 32 line departments participated in the Green Budget—more than double last year’s participation—with a total allocation of Rs 24,607.71 crores, accounting for 15.8% of the total state budget. A well-defined methodology, comprehensive guidelines, and structured capacity-building programs have been instrumental in achieving this progress.

  The ‘Green Growth for Greener Assam’ initiative, under the ‘Astadash Mukutor Unnoyonee Mala’ of FY 2024-25, has introduced innovative interventions and made remarkable strides in sustainable development. A key achievement of Green Budgeting has been the significant increase in public procurement of greener alternatives, reaffirming Assam’s commitment to advancing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

GREEN BUDGET IN ASSAM

FOR FY 2025-26

  For FY 2025-26, several green initiatives have been proposed in the Assam Assembly (detailed in Section IV). A major highlight is the approval of the Assam Integrated Clean Energy Policy, 2025, which focuses on solar power, wind energy, small hydro projects, pumped hydro storage, battery energy storage systems, green hydrogen, biofuels, and electric mobility.

  As we present the Green Budget for 2025-26, we reaffirm our commitment to integrating environmental and climate priorities into our fiscal policies. We also emphasize the need for robust monitoring mechanisms to track expenditures, assess the impact of green initiatives, and ensure accountability in achieving environmental sustainability objectives.

GREEN BUDGET IN ASSAM

FOR FY 2025-26

  Green Budgeting is a strategic public finance management tool that ensures budgetary processes align with the state’s environmental and climate goals. By enabling the efficient allocation of resources, it reinforces Assam’s initiatives in climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, and environmental sustainability while advancing multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and other SDGs, fostering a more sustainable and resilient future in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement and other national and state commitments. and aligning with India’s commitments under the Paris Agreement. In Assam, Green Budgeting has helped to:

  Streamline environmental sustainability and

  climate resilience into fiscal framework and governance

  Reinforce the need to look at public procurement from the ‘Green lens’

  -sustainable expenditure

  Encourage departments to align with national and international commitments towards climate change

  Enabled through Green budget, Guwahati Municipal Corporation piloted a 20 KLD Faecal Sludge Treatment Plan in Guwahati. The sustainable bio-resources based project leverages Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket to treat sewage and contributes towards rejuvenation of Borsola Beel at Guwahati. This is a significant step towards the challenge of 130 MLD waste generation in Guwahati every day and exemplifies how green budgeting can drive innovative and sustainable solutions for urban challenges.

  This year, 18 departments have reported under the Green Budget Statement, in addition to the 14 that participated last year, marking more than a twofold increase from the previous year, covering nine vulnerable sectors to climate change as identified with Assam State Action Plan on Climate Change (ASAPCC). These include:

  GREEN BUDGET IN ASSAM

  FOR FY 2025-26

  The following steps have been followed for carrying out Green Budgeting in Assam in FY 2025-26:

  Step 1: Identification and selection of schemes by the departments

  Departments have identified and mapped budgetary allocations for schemes that directly or indirectly contribute to climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, and environmental sustainability. The focus was on prioritising schemes with clear environmental objectives.

  [][][]Identification of four categories based on their impact on the environment

+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|   Categories            |   Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |   Green Budget share                                           |
+=========================+:===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+================================================================+
|   Highly Favourable     |   The schemes where the principal intent is to address climate action and impact would fall under this category. These Schemes would bring highly favourable direct impact for the environment and climate change.                             |   100% of the allocation is towards Green Initiatives          |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|   Moderately Favourable |   The schemes where the principal intent is not towards climate action but the impact is favorable towards climate action goals or environmental protection. These schemes would bring indirect impacts on the environment and climate change. |   At least 40% of the allocation is towards green initiatives  |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|   Neutral               |   Schemes that do not target or not have a relevant impact for the environment and climate change.                                                                                                                                             |   Less than 40% of the allocation is towards green initiatives |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|   Less favourable       |   Schemes that need improvement for climate action.                                                                                                                                                                                            |   No allocation towards green initiatives                      |

FOR FY 2025-26

  Step 2: Mentioning the scheme objectives

  Each department has clearly stated specific objectives for the identified schemes. This helped in assessing their relevance and impact on climate change and environmental sustainability.

  Step 3: Selection of the broad domain

  Each scheme was categorised under one of the three broad domains, as per the Assam State Action Plan on Climate Change (ASAPCC).

  Explanation of three broad domains

It also help in increase in production and productivity of agricultural and horticultural crops. It also create employment generation for rural youths through installation of Drip and Sprinkler irrigation systems. As Micro Irrigation promotes precision irrigation, hence water use efficiency is far better that traditional irrigation systems. In traditional irrigation, water use efficiency is about 30-40% whereas in Micro Irrigation system, water use efficiency is as high as 70-90 %. |                          |

It also help in increase in production and productivity of agricultural and horticultural crops. It also create employment generation for rural youths through installation of Drip and Sprinkler irrigation systems. As Micro Irrigation promotes precision irrigation, hence water use efficiency is far better that traditional irrigation systems. In traditional irrigation, water use efficiency is about 30-40% whereas in Micro Irrigation system, water use efficiency is as high as 70-90 %. |                          |

It also help in increase in production and productivity of agricultural and horticultural crops. It also create employment generation for rural youths through installation of Drip and Sprinkler irrigation systems. As Micro Irrigation promotes precision irrigation, hence water use efficiency is far better that traditional irrigation systems. In traditional irrigation, water use efficiency is about 30-40% whereas in Micro Irrigation system, water use efficiency is as high as 70-90 %. |                          |

As such, it does not aim to have any direct or measurable impact on environmental protection or climate change. Given its narrow scope, which prioritizes scientific development without addressing ecological concerns, the scheme is considered neutral in terms of environmental impact. It neither contributes to nor detracts from environmental sustainability, making it effectively neutral with respect to its effect on the environment and climate change. Therefore, the scheme does not aim to influence environmental outcomes. |   0.0                    |
