1. # **Background:**

   2. **About Assam:**

Assam covers an area of 78,438 km2 (30,285 sq. mi) and notably situated in a high rain fall zone, which makes the state naturally potential to support production of food grains in abundance with heterogeneous population with socio-cultural and ethnic diversity. Agriculture and allied activities are the primary source of livelihood engaging about half of the total working population and generating roughly one-third of the State’s gross product.

Assam has taken many initiatives in the recent past to boost its production and services segment that include policies like Industrial and Investment Policy of Assam, 2019, Assam Startup Policy 2018, Assam Agarwood Promotion Policy, 2020, Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam, 2021 \&Assam Ethanol Production Promotion Policy, 2021\. This sets Assam as one of the highest Growth State in the North East region.

The State has dedicated Tea Park, food processing park and four oil refineries to capitalize on its pool of natural resources (tea, oil and natural gas to name a few). Industries in Assam contribute 39% to the State’s GSDP and provide direct employment to approximately four lakh people and indirect employment to around 20 lakh people.

Although, Assam is known for its premium tea and petroleum refineries, the fact is that nearly 70% of its workforce is employed in agriculture or related activities, thus showing the huge gap between the state and rest of the country in terms of growth in industrial infrastructure. Agro-based industries of Assam broadly include tea industry, sugar industry, grain mill products industry (rice, oil, and flour mill), and food processing industry. Assam’s proximity to some neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan benefits its trade. Assam is situated in the north-eastern region of India, bordering seven states including Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, and West Bengal. Assam also serves as a regional hub for the north Eastern states of India given its vital role in connecting with the rest of India through the chicken’s neck corridor. Assam’s proximity to countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, and other ASEAN markets puts the state in a unique geo-strategic locational

advantage. Myanmar lies in about an hour’s distance connected to the easternmost part of Assam. Assam has geostrategic locational advantage as not only a gateway to North-East India but also as a growth corridor to ASEAN countries.

Transport and logistics are vital factors in economic development. An efficient logistics system is a pre-requisite for economic and social transformation. Given the crucial role of logistics in facilitating mobility of goods and people for production, marketing, trade and commerce, public services delivery, social interaction/cohesion, and regional integration, it becomes essential to strategize interventions in the field.

An essential activity in the logistic function is to support economic utilities of space and time. Doing this in a “green” environmentally friendly, sustainable, and inclusive manner is a necessity. There is a need for a vision that serves the ambitions of Assam while addressing future constraints (resource depletion, environmental pollution, and congestion).

Three major areas of logistics development that Assam Government intends to address are:

1) Establish, improve and maintain progressive policies and regulation, and institutional frameworks to ensure effective operation of logistics sector and to create a fair and equitable competitive environment.

   2) Ensure progressive development of logistics sector towards safe, green, energy efficient and inclusive services sector

      3) Develop policies where market mechanisms do not work effectively, for e.g. in improving infrastructure, in enhancing use of information technology and in developing technical standards of services.

With the above purpose and role of Government in mind, this policy aims at making Assam a regional Logistics hub to augment the economic development

2. # **Transport Infrastructure and Services:**

Transportation comprises an important part of logistics efficiency. The major modes of transportation in Assam are roadways, railways, airways, and inland waterways. At present, there are two roads-cum-rail bridges and one Road Bridge over the Brahmaputra River. Assam accounts for approximately 60% of the total road length in the north-east. The major towns in the state are connected by national highways.

With a total rail route length of 2435.13 kms, Assam has a railway network connecting the state to the rest of the country. Within the state, a broad- gauge rail network connects all the major towns.

The Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport at Guwahati is 22 km from the city centre, and is well connected to New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai. There are also regular intra-state air services connecting six airports in Guwahati, Tezpur, Jorhat, Dibrugarh, Silchar, Kokrajhar and North Lakhimpur. Nearly 600 flights operate every week from LGBI Airport. Under the UDAN Scheme, Assam had proposed subsidized international connectivity from Guwahati to six destinations in South and SE Asia \- Singapore, Dhaka, Yangon, Kathmandu, Kualalumpur and Bangkok.

Inland Waterways \- 891 kms long National Waterways-2 & 121 kms long National Waterways-16 forms the inland waterways network in Assam. The Assam government aims to develop the rivers of the North East as viable and sustainable means for cargo and passenger transportation.

1. # **Excellence in Public and Business Service Delivery:**

   * Government of Assam in its endeavor for excellence in Public and Business service delivery in Logistics and Transport sector has launched 25 Aadhaar-based contactless services in the recent past

   which has the potential to save over than 3.5 million person-days annually. Few of these contactless services are:

     * Fully built Motor Vehicles shall be registered directly by the MV Dealers against Aadhaar-authentication of the customer. The RCs will also be printed at the dealer-point & thus there will be no requirement to visit DTO office

       * Special permit is provided to Transport vehicles for allowing it to ply temporarily for a limited period not exceeding 10 days on special occasion/ground on route/routes, other than the permitted routes

       * Periodic Permit may be taken by the owner of a transport vehicle for a period of either 1 year or 3 to 5 years

       * On expiry of validity of PUCC, it is required to pay Rs. 500 to get the PUCC renewed, which can be deposited online now onwards without the requirement to visit DTO office

     * Assam government in its endeavor for excellence in Public service delivery has already launched 13 Nos of Aadhaar-based contactless services relating to Driving Licence and vehicles by making necessary arrangement in Sarathi & Vahan Software in collaboration with NIC. Few of the contactless services are:  
       * Issus of Learners Licence

       * Renewal of Driving Licence

       * Duplicate Driving Licence

       * Transfer of Ownership of Vehicle

       * Change of address in RC

     * More than 7 Lakhs Citizens have availed the benefit of the above mentioned Online Contactless Services since September 2021 without visiting DTO offices. This has saved more than 20 Lakh productive man days in a year

     * After successful launch of the above contactless services, the department is ready to launch more contactless services related to Driving License and Vehicles, which is expected to reduce footfalls significantly in DTO Offices

3. # **Policy Vision & Objectives:**

        * Integration of multiple modes of transportation is a key objective of the policy.

     4. # **Focus on Inland Water Transport for Logistics Movement:**

        * With 15 National Waterways (NW), Assam has nearly 10% of cumulative navigable length of all 111 NWs in India. 24-hour Night navigation facilities are put in place by IWAI from Dhubri up to Dibrugarh. Government of Assam has identified four ports which will be used as immigration checkpoints, namely, Silghat, Pandu, Karimganj and Dhubri.  
        * IWT is an energy efficient and cheaper mode of transport for bulk commodities, especially those originating and terminating on the water fronts. It is environment friendly and has high employment potential. It is estimated that 1 litre of fuel can move 24 MT on road, 85 MT on railways and 105 MT on inland water.  
        * Government of Assam, through this policy shall strive to promote and incentivize logistics movement through Inland Water Transport especially on National Waterway-2 and National Waterways-16.

     5. # **Safe transportation of hazardous materials (Hazmat), Dangerous Goods (DG) and Over Dimensional Cargo (ODC):**

Model Concession Agreements and Financial support framework to PPP shall be developed.  
        * Will foster the growth of modern logistics service providers that apply state of art logistics concepts and advanced transport management models.

     7. # **Encourage use of technology in logistics sector:**

        * Policy also promotes and incentivizes use of modern technology to monitor cargo in transit, specifically time and quality sensitive cargo such as perishables, Tea, Minerals, Pharmaceuticals, Agro-products etc  
        * Use of digital technology like RFID, GPS, geo fencing technologies by logistics service providers to ensure enforcement of regulations in Assam shall be encouraged

        * Construct and effective system to strengthen the technical capacity of transport operators

     8. # **Enhance ease of doing business:**

        * Single window clearance mechanism: All permissions/licenses such as Trade License, building plan approval, Labour approvals etc. pertaining to Logistics and Warehousing will be granted on submission of dedicated common application form through Ease of Doing Business Portal of Single Window Agency of Department of Industries, Commerce & Public Enterprises. Dedicated relationship

   managers shall be appointed assisting the projects in obtaining necessary clearances.

        * Promote the creation of unified technical standards

        * Encourage the formation of responsible trade associations in the transport industry

     9. # **Focus on skill development:**

        * Through this policy, Government of Assam envisages to create over 15,000 jobs in the logistics sector within the State. With such projections and adoption of new & sophisticated technologies and specialized procedures; need for skilled manpower will surge to maintain the quality of services in this sector.

        * For this, sector specific skilling programs/ courses shall be initiated to build manpower capability in the sector. This shall be undertaken through tie-ups with national and state level educational institutions and government bodies such, IIT Guwahati, Gauhati University and Assam Skill Development Mission, among others.  
        * Reports suggest that despite of a large potential, women’s participation in logistics and transport has been limited. One of the biggest entry barriers for women in the sector has been a lack of skills and training that enables women to work. Government of Assam, through this policy seeks to provide adequate training support to women enabling them to participate in the logistics and transport workforce. There are 28 Industrial Training Institutes in Assam of which 5 of them are dedicated for development of female workforce. These ITI’s offer Draughtsman (Civil), Surveyor, Turner, Machinist, Mechanic (Motor vehicle), Information Communication Technology & System Maintenance, Fabricator and several other engineering and non-engineering trades.

        * The upcoming Assam Skill University Project will assist the Government of Assam in strengthening its skills education and training system to ensure decent employment for all and accelerate sustainable and inclusive infrastructure and industrial development. It will create pathways for skills progression and mobility between technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and higher education through the establishment of a skill university and will raise skill levels to enhance the productivity and competitiveness of

   industries in Assam. The project will enhance skills and employability of youth and adults, especially women and those from disadvantaged groups, and improve their prospect of getting higher-paying, decent jobs.

     10. # **Steps towards ensuring sustainability in logistics sector:**

         * Government of Assam shall adopt several interventions to promote use of clean fuel in logistics activities:  
         * Promoting use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) for internal/ short movement at logistics facilities and intra city level to reduce carbon footprint.  
         * Identify priority corridors for development of charging infrastructure for EVs for freight and e-commerce activities as part of logistics master plan.  
         * Explore feasibility and promote use of alternate greener modes of transport for suitable commodities to reduce vehicular emissions.  
         * In this effect, the Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam 2021 envisages to bring about a material improvement in Assam’s air quality by bringing down emissions from transport sector. To do so, this policy will seek to drive rapid adoption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in a manner where they contribute to 25% of all new vehicle registrations by 2026\.  
         * The Electric Vehicle Policy of Assam 2021 also aims at phasing out all fossil fuel based commercial fleets and logistics vehicles in all cities by 2030\.

     11. # **Enable robust crisis management:**

         * The recent pandemic affected the supply chains and transportation across sectors and highlighted the importance of crisis management for logistics sector. To ensure hassle free movement of commodities and to address bottlenecks created by emergency situations, a Logistics Crisis Management Group (LCMG) will be established within the state to facilitate the movement of commodities under emergency circumstances.

     12. # **Standardization:**

         * Assam Government will work with Government of India and with standard setting bodies for logistics in India such as the Bureau of India  Standards,  Indian  Institute  of  Packaging  to  customize
