Soil Health Card

Soil Health Card 2.1. Introduction Soil is a living medium which serves as a natural nutrient source for growth of plants. The components of soils are mineral, organic matter, water and air, the proportions of which vary and together form a system for plant growth. Soils are studied and classied according to their use. Soil surveys are made for Natural Resource Management and soil testing is conducted as part of Fertilizer Use and Management. 2.2. Nutrient Status of Soils 2.2.1. In India, intensive agriculture has resulted in impressive growth in food grain production powered by improved varieties of seeds, application of fertilizers and assured irrigation. The existing NPK consumption ratio in the country is skewed at 8.2:3.2:1 (2012-13) as against the preferred ratio of 4:2:1. A great variability is observed in fertiliser consumption among States from 250 kg / ha in Punjab, 212 kg / ha in Bihar, 207 kg / ha in Haryana to 4.8 kg / ha in Nagaland and 2 kg / ha in Arunachal Pradesh in nutrient form during 2012-13. However, imbalanced application of fertilisers have caused deciency of primary nutrients (i.e. NPK), secondary nutrients (such as sulphur), and micronutrients (boron, zinc, copper etc.), in most parts of country. 2.2.2. Site specic nutrient management involving soil test based application of fertilizers is critical to enhance fertilizer use efciency. A fertilizer not suitable to a soil type can be called as an incorrect fertilizer used for that soil, and in such case, fertilizer consumption ceases to be efcient to increase production. Different types of fertilizers are required to be used in acidic/ alkaline soils. Fertigation involving the use of water soluble fertilizers through drip and sprinkler irrigation is expected to give better use efciency for water and fertilizers. Therefore, it is necessary to promote use of required sources of plant available forms of nutrients coupled with use of soil amendments in acidic/ alkaline soils so as to enhance soil nutrient availability. In India, in general, blanket fertilizer recommendations are followed for N, P & K which rarely matches soil fertility need, and often ignoring secondary and micro nutrients, in various cropping systems followed by small and marginal farmers. Keeping in view the above facts, Government of India is promoting integrated nutrient management (INM)i.e. balanced and judicious use of chemical fertilizers, along with bio fertilizers and locally available organic manures based on soil testing to maintain soil health and crop productivity. 2.3. Soil Testing Programme 2.3.1. Soil testing programme was started in India in the year 1955-56 with the setting up of 16 Soil Testing Laboratories (STLs) under "Determination of Soil Fertility and Fertilizer Use" programme. Total nutrient content varies from soil to soil, and plant available forms of nutrients are chemically determined in soil testing laboratories. Till 1980, the laboratories generally used to analyze for pH, texture, electrical conductivity, organic carbon (as an index of available N), and available P and K. 2.3.2. The process of setting-up of soil testing laboratories has continued with nancial support from Government of India, year after year. In 2012-13, the soil analyzing capacity in the country was 128.31 lakh soil samples per annum. The soil testing facility is provided by State Governments to the farmers free of cost or with some nominal fee. 15

2.3.3. In view of the critical role played by soil testing in ensuring balanced and efcient use of fertilizers, states have been advised from time to time to enhance and improve their soil testing programme. The State Governments are preparing district wise and also block wise fertility maps. Some states have prepared village level fertility maps too. Other states have introduced soil testing on a ten hectare grid basis and are issuing soil health cards. Some state governments have started computerization of soil test data, which the farmers can access online and advisory can be sent through SMS to their mobile phones. Several states including Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh have made commendable progress in soil testing programme. They have taken up expansion of testing facilities, popularized the soil test analysis in a campaign mode and used information technology in delivering soil nutrient status and appropriate recommendations to farmers. 2.3.4. As seen from above, no uniform norms are followed in the country for soil analysis and distribution of Soil Health Cards. There is also a need to devise a mechanism to issue soil health cards every 3 years in respect of all landholdings in order to capture the soil fertility changes occurring due to plant uptake or other natural causes. More attention is required on the follow up measures on the soil nutrient deciencies identied in soil health cards. Along with soil health cards that diagnose fertility related constraints small and marginal farmers need technical support to apply site specic fertilizer recommendations. Therefore, Soil Health Card scheme is proposed for periodic testing of soil and to recommend nutrient management. 2.3.5. The scheme will be implemented in all the States to promote the soil testing services, issue of Soil Health Cards and development of Nutrient Management Practices. The scheme on Soil Health will be implemented in accordance with the guidelines described here under. Cost of the interventions proposed under the scheme will be shared in the ratio of 75:25 between the Central and the State Governments. 2.4. Scheme Objectives Objectives of scheme Soil Health Card are as follows: 2.4.1 To issue soil health cards every 3 years, to all farmers of the country, so as to provide a basis to address nutrient deciencies in fertilization practices, 2.4.2 To strengthen functioning of Soil Testing Laboratories (STLs) through capacity building, involvement of agriculture students and effective linkage with Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) / State Agricultural Universities (SAUs). 2.4.3 To diagnose soil fertility related constraints with standardized procedures for sampling uniformly across states and analysis and design taluqa / block level fertilizer recommendations in targeted districts, 2.4.4 To develop and promote soil test based nutrient management in the districts for enhancing nutrient use efciency, 2.4.5 To build capacities of district and state level staff and of progressive farmers for promotion of nutrient management practices. 2\. 5\. Scheme Components 2.5.1 Issue of soil health cards: Aims at periodic distribution of Soil health cards to all the farmers to provide information on soil fertility along with recommendations for application of plant nutrients. 2.5.2 Training for soil analysis: One-week hands-on orientation training to soil chemists, students/JRFs for soil analysis and fertilizer recommendation in the batches of 20 participants will be organized at SAUs/ICAR Institutes. 2.5.3 Financial assistance for package of nutrient recommendations: Aims to provide 16

nancial assistance to farmers to apply corrective measures for nutrient deciencies and popularizing balance and integrated nutrient management practices for their cropping systems. 2.5.4 Capacity building and regular monitoring and evaluation: Orientation for technical and line staff along with SAU/ ICAR institutions will be conducted by states. 2.5.5 Mission Management: For mission management, Project Management Team (PMT) will be constituted. 2.6. Ongoing programmes on Soil Health Management Soil Testing Programmes are also being implemented through National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY). They would continue to be implemented subject to these guidelines. The soil testing techniques & INM practices developed under this mission will be implemented in all the DAC programme. 2.7. Expected Outcome The Scheme envisages: 2.7.1 Distribution of Soil Health Cards to all the farmers in a round of every three years to promote Soil Health Management. 2.7.2 It will promote balanced and judicious use of plant nutrients. 2.7.3 Promotion of integrated nutrient system is expected to reduce the consumption of chemical fertilizers by 20%. 2.7.4 The productivity of selected crops is expected to increase signicantly. v. The demand for organic sources of plant nutrient like bio-fertilizers, organic manure, vermi-compost, slow release nitrogenous fertilizer like neem/sulphur coated urea will increase, which in turn improve the soil fertility as well nutrient use efciency. 2.8. Interventions Interventions proposed for the Scheme includes development of modalities for soil sample collection along with standard sampling norms, quality control in the soil analysis, training of sampling staff and STL personnel, intensive use of ICT for database management for faster delivery of soil health cards in PPP mode and popularizing soil test based INM through eld demonstrations/eld days. 2\. 9 Component 1: The Soil Health Card 2.9.1 Soil health card is eld-specic detailed report of soil fertility status and other important soil parameters that affect crop productivity. Besides, soil health, it also provides an advisory on soil test based use of fertilizers and amendments. 2.9.2 Details in a Soil Health Card 2.9.2.1 Information regarding Soil Fertility. . 2.9.2.2 Dosage of fertilizer application in crops. . 2.9.2.3 Information on soil amendments of saline or alkaline soil. 2.9.2.4 Recommendation on integrated nutrient management.

Soil Health The details of various components under Soil Health are given below and pattern of assistance is given at Annexure-I. 3.1 Setting up new Soil Testing Laboratories (STLs) and Mobile Soil Testing Laboratories (MSTLs) for macro nutrients and micro nutrients analysis. 3.2 Strengthening of existing State STLs for micronutrient analysis. 3.3 Capacity building through training of STL staff/extension ofcers/farmers and eld demonstration/workshop etc. 3.4 Creation of data-bank for balanced use of fertilizers, which is site specic. 3.5 Adoption of village by STLs (10 villages each) through Frontline Field Demonstrations. 3.6 Preparation of digital district soil maps (using Global Positioning System) and soil fertility monitoring system by ICAR/ State Agriculture Universities (SAUs). 3.7 Providing portable soil testing kits to eld level ofcers of State Govt. 3.8

Promotion and distribution of micronutrients.

3.9 Strengthening of Fertilizer Quality Control Laboratories 3.9.1 Strengthening/up-grading existing State Fertilizer Quality Control Laboratories. 3.9.2 Setting up of New Fertilizer Quality Control Laboratories by State Governments. 3.1. Setting up new Soil Testing Laboratories (STLs) and Mobile Soil Testing Laboratories (MSTLs) for macro nutrients and micro nutrients analysis 3.1.1 Setting up of new Soil Testing Laboratories (Static and Mobile)- In order to promote soil test based balanced and judicious use of chemical fertilizers, 100new static/mobile STLs will be set up in the country during the 12th Five Year Plan. 3.1.2 Norms for Assistance- 75% of the project cost, subject to a limit of Rs. 56 lakh, will be provided as subsidy for purchase of machinery & equipment, chemicals & glass wares, miscellaneous laboratory articles and contingencies as per indicative list at Annexure II. In case of Mobile STLs, nancial assistance from DAC shall be 75% of the project cost subject to a maximum of Rs. 56 lakh per Mobile STL as per indicative list at Annexure III. The suggested list of equipment can be changed in special circumstances only with the specic approval of INM Division. 3.1.3 Expected Outcome- It is expected that each of these static STLs equipped with AAS could analyse about 10000 soil samples per annum for NPK and Micronutrients. Efforts will

37

need to make for ensuring that one out of every three samples (preferably from the same locality) shall also be tested for micronutrients. Similarly, capacity of every MSTL is 5000 samples per annum, which should be optimally utilised. In case of Labs with ICP, this capacity will get enhanced to atleast 1 lac samples. 3.1.4 Involvement of Private Sector- Whereas normally Soil Testing labs will be set up by state government through state agencies, it is expected that state government will encourage involvement of other agencies such as Private Companies associated with Agriculture Extension in some way such as Fertilizer Companies, Agriclinics, NGOs, Cooperative Societies and private entrepreneurs(Agri-preneurs). The State Governments will need to announce clear guidelines for involving these private sector agencies in the operation and management of these Soil Testing labs. State Governments are encouraged to announce innovative PPP Guidelines for involvement of Private sector for running of these Labs. The guidelines should, inter alia, clearly dene all the terms and conditions including the soil testing charges to be charged from farmers and the MOU/Agreement to be signed with these private agencies, clear cut monitorable targets. State Governments will monitor and review performance of these private sector labs periodically. 3.2. Strengthening of Existing Soil Testing Laboratories 3.2.1 At present, there are 1087 soil testing laboratories (930 STLs and 157 MSTLs) working in the country having annual analyzing capacity of about 12 million soil samples. Many of the existing STLs do not have facilities for micronutrient analysis and the existing capacities of analysing NPK also is not being fully utilised. A onetime grant shall be provided to create facilities for analysis of micro-nutrients such as Zinc, Iron, Copper, Manganese, Boron, etc. Atleast 125 existing STLs will be strengthened during the 12th Five Year Plan period. 3.2.2 Norms for assistance- Rs. 30 lakhs per/lab for creating micronutrient analysis facilities through purchase of Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrophotometer ICP)/Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS), its accessories with required chemicals and glassware of standard quality as per indicative list at Annexure-IV. 3.2.3 Normally Existing STLs/MSTLs working under the control of the State Governments/UTs will be eligible for strengthening. For strengthening of STLs having no micro-nutrient analysis facility, performance assessment should be made keeping in view the existing staff before any assistance is given. Only working STLs should be supported. The State Government should carefully study the existing performance level of the STL and whether it requires any process change to achieve higher efciencies. Moreover, a system of

38

bench-marking should clearly be put in place. State Governments are encouraged to announce clearly dened and transparent guidelines for taking help of private sector as dened in para 1.4 above for operation and management of existing STL and MSTL , along with strengthening under the scheme. 3.3

Capacity Building through training of STL staff/extension ofcers/ farmers and eld demonstration/ workshops etc. on Soil health management/INM/balanced use of fertilizers

3.3.1

Training Programme for Staff The training programme to be organized for STL staff and eld functionaries on Balanced Use of Fertilizers will be a two day programme. The course content shall inter alia, include Importance of Soil testing in Soil Fertility Management; Sampling Methodology; Testing protocols; Interpretation of soil test results and calculation of nutrient requirement; Cropping system based nutrient management & Importance of balanced nutrition on productivity and quality of produce and soil health maintenance etc.

3.3.2. Training Programme for Farmers The training programme to be organized for farmers on Balanced Use of Fertilizers will be a two day programme. For organizing the two day training for farmers on Balanced Use of Fertilizers, the course content shall include, topics such as Importance of Soil Testing in Soil Health Management; Importance of balanced fertilizer use in crop productivity and Soil Health Management; Sampling protocols and sending samples to testing laboratories; Importance of organic manures and biofertilizers in balanced nutrition; Implementation of soil test results for soil fertility management as per the requirement of crop etc. 3.3.3. Field Demonstrations Field Demonstrations on Balanced Use of Fertilizers should be conducted at the farmers' eld. The entire package of practices except fertilization should be taken up uniformly. Cultural practices such as ploughing, disking, leveling, etc should be done before sowing/planting. The demonstration plot should preferably be of one acre (4000 sq. mt.) each in one single patch. Two or more well divided plots of total one acre can also be selected. Each demonstration plot should be divided into 2 equal parts i.e. Control part \- based on

39

existing practices adopted by the farmer and Treated part \- based on soil test based balanced fertilization including economic fertilizers such as SSP, Neem coated Urea, Sulphur Coated Urea, Zincated Urea, Customized Fertilizers, micro nutrients and Bio-Fertilizers & soil amendments, if required. All other cultural practices should be kept uniform till harvesting. 3.3.4. Farmers' fair A one day farmer's fair should be organized at a time when the crop is at almost grain forming/ fruiting stage or on the day of harvesting. 50 farmers from the nearby villages should be invited to demonstrate the impact and usefulness of balanced and soil test based fertilization practice. Efforts should be made to supply technical literature in the regional language. Two subject matter specialists should also be invited for proper technology transfer and for addressing farmers' queries. 3.3.5. State Governments may implement this component though any of the selected agencies such as ICAR institute/SAUs/KVK/Agriculture Department/state agency/Fertilizer Industry or may also involve any agriculture graduate or progressive farmer in its implementation. The number of programs will be decided by the INM division based on proposal received from states and UTs. Details of Norms for assistance and duration have been given in Annexure V. 3.3.6. GOI or state Government will organize or assist organization of regional and national workshop/seminar/exhibition through central agency or state agencies for promotion of Soil Health Management, Integrated Nutrient management or Balanced use of fertilizers. 3.4

Creation of Data Bank for site specic Balanced Use of Fertilizer

3.4.1 Objective- For promoting balanced use of fertilizers, it is essential to maintain region specic and location specic data on soil fertility. As on today, there is no systematic data or system available in the country for recommending site-specic nutrient requirement and delineation of secondary and micronutrient deciencies. It is proposed to create a National Data Bank. 3.4.2 State Governments can implement this intervention by any agency of their choice such as ICAR institute/SAUs/National Informatics Centre etc or even private sector, but the proposal should specically cover an action plan for the use of this data for educating

40

farmers. Transparent guidelines for selection of Private sector will need to be in place for approval of the proposal. 3.5

Adoption of village by STLs (maximum 10 Villages per STL) through Frontline Field Demonstration (FFD)

3.5.1 Objective For condence building of farmers about usefulness of balanced use of fertilizers, it is essential that STLs' recommendations are effectively demonstrated in villages. It is proposed to adopt8000 villages by 800 Soil Testing Laboratories to conduct frontline eld demonstration on balanced use of fertilizers. These 800 STLs shall be chosen by the State Government, a list will be sent to GOI along with the proposal. 3.5.2. Around 10 farmers belonging to the adopted village should be selected. A eld day shall invariably be arranged for farmers of the same or nearby villages. Subject matter specialists should explain the requirement and usefulness of soil test based fertilization and the importance of soil amendments. 3.5.3. Norms for Assistance-Rs. 20,000 per FFD as per the details at Annexure VI. 3.6

Preparation of Digital District Soil Maps and Global Positioning System (GPS) based Soil Fertility Monitoring

3.6.1. Objectives Lack of GPS based district soil fertility maps is the major hindrance in adopting balanced use of fertilizers. During 11th Plan IISS, Bhopal was entrusted the work of preparation of fertility maps of 171 districts in 19 major States. It is proposed to prepare digital district soil maps and GPS based soil fertility monitoring system in remaining agricultural districts during the 12th Five Year Plan. 3.6.2. State Governments/SAUs/ICAR Institutes/National Informatics Centre/KVKs or other central/state Government agency can be associated for implementation of this project. 3.6.3 Norms for Assistance will be restricted to around Rs. 6.00 lakh per district. 3.7.

Portable Soil Testing Kits for Balanced Use of Fertilizers For faster and on-farm testing of soil nutrient for balanced use of fertilizers assistance to State Government subject to maximum of Rs. 0.15 lakh/per kit will be provided. It is proposed to distribute 3000 soil testing kits to eld functionaries during 12th plan period. Preference will

41

be given for kits having micro nutrient facility. Technical suitability of kit will be decided in consultation with IARI, New Delhi. 3.8.

Promotion and Distribution of Micronutrient Intensive agriculture is experiencing widespread deciency of micronutrients particularly of Zinc followed by Iron, Manganese, Boron, etc. It is proposed to promote and distribute micronutrients during the entire 12th Five Year Plan. Assistance will limited to 50% of the cost of requisite nutrients subject to a maximum of Rs. 500 per hectare.

3.9

Strengthening of fertilizer quality control system

3.9.1. Strengthening/Up gradation of the existing State Fertilizer Quality Control Laboratories i.

In order to check the quality of the fertilizers sold in the country, at present there are 74 FQCL working under the control of different State Governments. Since quality testing is a statutory requirement under the Fertilizer Control Order (FCO), it is imperative to maintain all the instruments and equipment and to ensure supply of quality chemicals and glasswares for the analysis. This requires time-to-time upgradation and replacement of the equipment. Many of the State Laboratories are also facing acute nancial problem to maintain these facilities. Therefore, in order to maintain the high standard of analysis potential, it is proposed to upgrade and strengthen the existing FQCLs.

ii.

Eligible Agencies-FQCLs under State Governments. Assistance will be provided to only those State laboratories, which are functional and working well and there will be no recurring liability on the part of the Central Government.

iii.

Norms for Assistance-Rs.30 lakh per laboratory is to be provided for purchase of machinery & equipment, chemicals, glasswares and miscellaneous laboratory articles as indicated Annexure VII.

3.9.2. Setting up of new Fertilizer Quality Control Laboratories by State Governments Considering that the total number of dealers in the country by the end of the 12th Five Year Plan would be about 3.25 lakhs, the minimum requirement of fertilizer samples to d for ensuring quality is 6.50 lakh (to cover each dealer during kharif and rabi). The capacity of existing testing facilities (1.25 lakh) is quite inadequate and is only around 20 per cent of the requirement. It is, therefore, proposed to set up 20 new FQCLs by the State Governments for quality testing with annual analyzing capacity
