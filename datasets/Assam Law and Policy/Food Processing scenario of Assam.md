**FOOD PROCESSING SCENARIO OF ASSAM:-**

* Food processing sector of Assam is in infantry stage and % of Agriculture based Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) is only 20%.  
* Department of Industry and Commerce being the Nodal Department there should be an attempt to set up an independent structure or department for Investment in Assam.  
* Need of a platform to encourage Agri Entrepreneurs which need policy reform like implementation of state Food Processing policy.  
* Reducing the post harvest losses so that the income of farmers can be increased.  
* Post Harvest losses of Agriculture in general and horticultural commodities in particular are very high as Horticultural commodities are perishable in nature.( 25-40 %)  
* There is need to create an environment so that the stakeholders can learn about latest initiatives and opportunities available in the field of food industries.  
* Number of Food processing industries as well as the % of increase of MSME will be the indicator for Agriculture development in the state in coming years.  
* For sustainability of these Agro based enterprises there is need of a strong supply chain.  
* Now, it is the time of the stake holders to assess the requirement of these industries, so that farmers of State and the region can locally produce the same to meet the demand.  
* It is observed that the existing Agri-based industries have to collect the raw materials from outside the state, due to lack of volume as well as the quality.

* Linking up of Agro-based MSME with the Agricultural production clusters is the sustainable approach.  
* The requirement of raw materials and the quality is to be clearly determined well in advance, so that the farming community can be ready to produce abundantly to act as feeder of these industries.  
* We usually speak that unemployment problem can be resolved through development of Food processing sector. But it is time to attract unemployed towards these sectors showing the real path to get employment.  
* The state is having some of the niche commodities like scented rice, Komal rice, red rice back rice. The growth of Maize is very significant. Horticultural commodities like Pine apple, Banana, Ginger, Turmeric, Chillies and vegetables can contribute a lot for Setting up of Agro processing industries.  
* Black pepper and Arecanut both are industrially important crops which can be grown together having Arecanut as support of black pepper.

* Fibre less varieties of Ginger like Nadia and highly curcumin content varieties of turmeric are available in the state. But volume of these produce as we as the number of enterprises/ industries to process these produce are closely correlated.  
* Assam as well as North Eastern Region (NER) is rich in Medicinal Plants. Organization like Patanjali, Dabur have come forward to set up Agro –processing units, hence we have to be ready to develop these sector as done for tea. Because Assam is known for tea only due to processing, branding and proper marketing.

* Govt of India as well Assam Government has set up target to doubling the farmers’ income by 2022 and Agro processing is one of its solution to double the farmers income.  
* Setting up of Mega Food Park at Tihu in Nalbari district and the Food Processing Industrial park at Chaygaon is a milestone in Food Processing sector.  
* Horticulture & Food processing Department is looking after the Primary Processing and the Small scale Food processing units in the state.  
* However, MIDH and MOVCD are two schemes which kept scope to attract investor in medium scale Food Processing sector.
