### **Capital Investment Subsidy Scheme under National Bamboo Mission Procedure for Sanction and Release of Subsidy**

There are a number of activities under NBM which are to be financed by a credit linked back ended subsidy by Financial Institutions (Fis) including banks. The following is a gist of the procedure to be followed, to be read along with the flow chart and formats annexed:

1. ### **Advance Subsidy**

   50% of the eligible subsidy amount will be released as advance by State level Bamboo Development Agency to the participating Fl (bank) on submission of a project scrutiny note cum claim form as per requirement and the norms of Nl3M. The same would be kept in a Subsidy Reserve Fund Account of the concerned borrowers, to be adjusted finally against 1oan amount of the bank towards the end of the repayment period and completion of project as per the time schedule.

2. ### **Final instalment of subsidy**

   The remaining 50% would be disbursed to the participating banks by State level Bamboo Development Agency. after conduct of an inspection by the Joint Monitoring Inspection Committee consisting of officials from the financing bank, State and District level Bamboo Development Agency and their recommendations lo that effect.

3. ### **Adjustment of subsidy to Borrower's Account**

   The subsidy released to the bank for individual project will be kept in a separate borrower­ wise account. The adjustment of subsidy will be back-ended. Accordingly, the full project cost including the subsidy amount, but excluding the margin money contribution from the beneficiary , would be disbursed as a loan by the banks. The repayment schedule will be drawn on the loan amount in such a way that the total subsidy amount is adjusted after the full bank loan component with interest is liquidated.

4. ### **Utilisation Certificate**

After release of final instalment of subsidy, a Utilisation Certificate is required to be submitted by the financing bank certifying that the full amount of subsidy received in respect of the project has been fully utilised (by way of crediting to the "Subsidy Reserve Fund Account \-Borrower-wise") and adjusted in the books of Account under the sanctioned terms and conditions of the project within the overall guidelines of the scheme.
