**SCHEMES UNDER CMSGUY**

**Distribution of Combined Harvester under CMSGUY**

**INTRODUCTION:**

Harvesting is one of the most labour intensive operations in agriculture, which is required to be done at appropriate time so as to obtain optimum yield. Delay in harvest will have a direct impact not only on the yield but also on quality of produce. Further, the method of harvest and wastage of produce are interlinked. Traditionally, harvesting is done manually in rural areas and particularly in small land holdings. 

In Assam, as elsewhere in India labour shortage is on a rise, so harvesting crops with a Self-Propelled Combine Harvester can save time as well as human labor, and bring down work costs for farmers. In addition, these machines can also increase agricultural output since the harvesting is carried out in a more efficient manner, and this, in turn, can make farming more profitable. 

**OBJECTIVES:**

Presently the availability of combine harvesters are not spread uniformly due to high capital cost and therefore needs to be transported from more mechanized States such  
as Punjab and Gujarat to other States. The Director of Agriculture, Assam with the financial assistance from CMSGUY proposes to distribute one   Mini Combine Harvester in each Legislative Assembly Constituency of Assam at subsidized rate to Farmer groups viz. ASG, PPS, FPC \&FPO or private Entrepreneur with an intention to make the machinery available locally to intending farmers on custom hiring basis in order to facilitate and perform timely harvest operation and to reduce the operation cost. 

**PROVISION OF SUBSIDY :**  
The department proposes to give 80% (Eighty percent) subsidy under CMSGUY scheme for procuring  Mini Combine Harvester . The department proposes to distribute 126 mini combine Harvester in each of the Assembly Constituencies of Assam in 1st phase.	

**FEATURES OF SELF-PROPELLED COMBINE HARVESTER WITH WHEELS:**

A combine harvester is an essential equipment for the modern farm operation.  The combine harvester, or simply combine, is a machine that harvests grain crops. The name derives from its combining three separate operations comprising harvesting (reaping), threshing, and winnowing—into a single process. A combine is a reaper and thresher wheel together to harvest, thresh and clean the grain from the straw in one operation. This allows the crop to be harvested more quickly and efficiently, and enables farmers to harvest larger amounts. To be more precise, work of a combine may be stated as follows:

1. Harvesting.  
2. Feeding of crops to the threshing unit.  
3. Threshing the seed from the head  
4. Separating the seed from the straw  
5. Cleaning the seed from the chaff
