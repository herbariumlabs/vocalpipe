### Introduction

The existing Extension & IT Schemes from 11th Plan have been strengthened, expanded and up-scaled appropriately and implemented as components of **Sub Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE)** under **National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology (NMAET)**. With the approval of NMAET all the IT Schemes of DAC have been subsumed with the Mission. The Mission Mode Project, **National E- Governance Plan in Agriculture (NeGP-A)** introduced during last phase of the 11th Plan, to achieve rapid development of agriculture in India through the use of ICT, has been continued during 12th Plan as a part of SMAE.

Besides this, following Department and State specific e-Governance initiatives in Agriculture & allied sectors at the Centre and States/UTs will also continue during 12th Plan period in conjunction with NeGP-A:

1.  Strengthening of IT apparatus in Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (Hqrs), Field Offices and Directorates of DAC
2.  Strengthening of IT Apparatus in Agriculture and Cooperation in the States and Union Territories (AGRISNET)
3.  Development of Agricultural Informatics and Communication
4.  Kisan Call Centre

All the IT initiatives of DAC will be integrated to enable the farmers in making proper and timely use of the information available through multiple ICT channels including Web Portals, Common Service Centres, Internet Access Points, Touch Screen Kiosks and SMSs through State Wide Area Network & State Data Centre and availability of Government to Citizen (G2C) Services.

### National e-Governance Plan in Agriculture (NeGP-A)

##### Background:

NeGP-A is proposed to be implemented across the country and aims at offering Government to Citizen / Farmer (G2C or G2F), Government to Business (G2B) and Government to Government (G2G) agricultural services in an integrated manner through the Central Agriculture Portal (CAP) and State Agriculture Portals (SAPs).

##### The key objectives of the Project include:

*   Bringing farmer centricity & service orientation to the programs
*   Enhancing reach & impact of extension services
*   Improving access of farmers to information & services throughout crop- cycle
*   Building upon, enhancing & integrating the existing ICT initiatives of Centre, and States
*   Enhancing efficiency & effectiveness of programs through process redesign
*   More effective management of schemes of DAC
*   Promoting a common framework across states

##### The scheme is expected to bring the following benefits to the Stakeholders – Farmers, business and Government(s):

*   Provide uniform face of government to agriculture sector stakeholders (especially farmers)
*   Service-level governed service delivery with built-in checks and balances to increase efficiency
*   Streamlined processes which make Government efficient and effective for service delivery
*   Integration of existing initiatives with new ones, thus creating sustainable balance of ICT
*   Improved monitoring of compliance, MIS and utilization of public money
*   The Project would make current service delivery mechanisms more efficient, transparent and accountable. Further, it would facilitate farmers to have easy accessibility to these services through multiple service delivery channels. The Project will also help the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC) to optimise its costs in delivery of services to various stakeholders. The Project will generate efficiencies in the system and the benefits shall be realised immediately after implementation which will more than offset the total cost of the Project over a period of time.

The farmer value proposition emanating from this Project can be succinctly depicted as follows:

The Mission Mode Project on Agriculture is one of the 27 Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) under the State Category of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) duly approved by the Union Cabinet in May, 2006.

##### Implementation Strategy

*   Delivery of services to various stakeholders shall be done through multiple modes including Government Offices, Internet Touch Screen Kiosks, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), Kisan Call Centres (KCCs), Agri-Clinics, Common Service Centres (CSCs) and Mobile Phones (Broadcast, IVRS, Voice-recognition and Interactive Messaging, using USSD i.e. Unstructured Supplementary Service Data). Central Agriculture Portal and State Agriculture Portals developed under this Project will not only standardize and facilitate data flow within and outside the State, but will also capture best features of various applications already implemented in different parts of the country.
*   For this purpose, the scope of the project includes Data / Disaster Recovery Centres (including media streaming servers), computer hardware down to the Block level, site preparation, project management, application development / customisation, data digitisation, capacity building and training & change management. The underlying approach is to identify best e-Governance

practices in the country, up-scale & upgrade the same and integrate various applications to get a national platform while giving requisite adaptability for State level variations.

*   As NeGP-A would bring within its ambit all the activities essential for dissemination of information through various ICT enabled delivery channels including software development applications, ensuring availability of hardware and software system, networking, manpower training, data digitisation etc., the States participating in this Programme shall be granted financial assistance under the AGRISNET Project under the Central Sector Scheme “**Strengthening/Promoting of Agricultural Information System**” only for those development activities which do not get covered under NeGP-A. However, the prescribed norms of AGRISNET for seeking financial assistance from the GOI shall be adhered. Computers and peripherals will be provided to the field locations after considering existing availability of hardware at field locations from various resources of the State Government and AGRISNET. **Unspent balances under AGRISNET (without any definite plan of action) will be considered as part of Government of India resources available for NeGP- A.**
*   Common applications (with adequate provision for localization) with respect to

**12 Clusters of Services** will be deployed down to the Block level across country. These 12 Clusters consist of 23 Services which, in turn, have about

75 Components on the whole. The Clusters as identified during Phase-1 of NeGP-A have been listed at [http://dacnet.nic.in/AMMP/AMMP.htm](http://dacnet.nic.in/AMMP/AMMP.htm) along with as on date SRS Documents and brief presentations thereon. **The States may give further suggestions and input for additions / improvement in SRS Documents or even addition of Services latest by the end of 15 June, 2014.** It will be seen that in terms of software design & development, complexity of implementation and physical outreach, NeGP-A is equivalent to many other Mission Mode Projects put together. These Clusters / Services / Components are to be implemented throughout the country down to the Block level during a period of 05 years from 2014-2015. The Government of India support will extend in respect of different components for various periods as stated in these Guidelines.

*   In addition to strengthening IT infrastructure down to Block level and developing clusters of services, NeGP-A specifically envisages:
    *   Requisite hardware and application software for e-Pest Surveillance at 2100 locations in tandem with hand-held devices being provided under ATMA Scheme.
    *   Strengthening of IT infrastructure in more than 1000 markets and introducing e-Mandis at select locations in an integrated manner and preferably using an integrated web-based software. Work being done as part of the Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing will be dovetailed in this regard.
*   National Informatics Centre (NIC) has been selected as an organisation to develop the Solution Design and System Requirement Specifications (SRS), Solution Development, Solution Testing & Acceptance, Solution Implementation, Training & Change Management (pertaining to the application software), Solution Warranty and Support and other activities as stipulated in the Services Level Agreement signed with them. Subject to techno- administrative feasibility, more services and components can be added based on suggestions received from various States. Implementation Agency (ies) (IA) shall be appointed after following a competitive bidding process for Supply, Installation, Commissioning, Operation & Maintenance of Hardware & System Software and Training on basics of IT. The Project is already under implementation in 187 districts and 1505 Blocks in 7 States viz. Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. It will now be rolled out in the remaining Districts and Blocks of the country. Number of Blocks in a State will be considered at the same level as in case of ATMA Scheme subject to the provision contained in foot-note in **Annexure-IA**.

### Management Structure

## Steering Committee

A Steering Committee comprising of key officials from Ministry of Agriculture, NIC and NISG is already in place to provide strategic direction and to address policy level issues.

In addition to the above following officers shall be co-opted from different States on rotation basis.

*   04 Principal Secretary Agriculture.
*   02 Principal Secretary(IT)
*   04 Principal Secretary Horticulture
*   02 Principal Secretary Animal Husbandry/Fisheries

The existing structure of Steering Committee as shown in the above figure will be responsible for the following functions:

1.  Provide strategic direction and guidance to the Agriculture MMP
2.  Decide on policy level issues that need to be addressed from time to time
3.  Be the final authority for approving all the deliverables

## Operations Committee

Representatives of State Government can be co-opted as needed. Key functions of the Operations Committee include:

1.  Review the progress of implementation at the central and state levels
2.  Provide technical and functional support to the implementation teams at a strategic level
3.  Facilitate States in the implementation of the projects
4.  Operational review with the Central Programme Management Unit.

### Role of State Governments in NeGP-A

The responsibility to ensure overall coordination between the IA and NIC shall be of the State Government (through the Commissioner Agriculture/Director Agriculture). In fact, the State Agriculture Department along with the State IT

Department will need to take complete ownership of the Project with respect to all key activities taking place in the States.

##### Key activities to be undertaken by the State Governments :-

*   1.  Civil Infrastructure Preparation (including provision of space for Help Desk and, if any component of a Service is to be developed in the State, for the outsourced programmers)
    2.  Backup power arrangements, wherever needed
    3.  Hiring of manpower on contract basis
    4.  Setting up of State Project Monitoring Unit (PMU)
    5.  Comprehensive inputs on SRS documents and feedback on pilot run of software packages
    6.  Infrastructure and logistic related support to NIC for training and capacity building
    7.  Data digitization, localization (including translation of web-pages in language of the State) and updation of data regularly by various stakeholders in the State
    8.  Receipt and Acceptance Testing of the computer hardware and system software
    9.  Recurring expenditure on power and consumables except to the extent of funding by the Government of India.
*   Since the entire task is to be accomplished in a time bound manner, the States will need to complete all the preparatory work expeditiously.
*   Animal Husbandry Department has not been included as of now in the Departments to be provided computer hardware as the same has been covered under a different national level project. It is also possible that some States may have offices, which are critical from operational point of view for this Project, at intermediate levels viz. zonal level (over a group of districts) and sub-divisional level (over a group of blocks). The State may propose hardware for these locations also so long as the overall numbers broadly remain within the norms given in **Annexure – I B**.
*   State Agriculture Department in respective States will act as Nodal Department for implementing NeGP-A. State Agriculture Department will be responsible for collecting, collating information & coordinating all activities with State Horticulture and Fisheries departments also.
*   Some States may have one or more of the services envisaged in NeGP-A already in place. **The States may also have some other pressing need to which it may like to give greater attention. Therefore, 25% of the amount earmarked for software development has been left to the discretion of the States to take care of their local requirements.** The remaining sum is to be used for development of additional application software packages, development on new platforms such as Android, Java, Windows Mobile, iOS etc., distribution of Mobile Resident Applications (which work without 2G / 3G connectivity) & outreach to farmers, end user trainings on applications & change management and procurement of client interface software products as per need. NIC has already prepared SRSs for 12 Clusters of Services. These SRSs will be circulated to all States for identifying needed customisation and other local additions/modifications.

##### As per the cost break-up under the Scheme, the States will need to give its share only for manpower (0%, 30% & 50% State share during first 3 years after which Government of India support on manpower will cease) and contribute to site preparation (45% State share except sites for the Training Centres which will be funded fully by the GOI). As per assumed unit cost norms and quantities, overall cost sharing pattern works out to 89.19:10.81 or say about 90:10.

*   A nodal officer not below the rank of Additional Director (preferably IT literate or IT Savvy) shall be nominated for interacting regularly with GOI and other Stakeholders. He may not be moved out of this assignment till the completion of the project.
*   States may first prepare a detailed list of existing IT infrastructure in the format available at [http://farmer.gov.in/cais/login.aspx](http://farmer.gov.in/cais/login.aspx) and summarise its overall requirement in **Annexure-I B** after deducting the hardware already available (from any other scheme or project of the Government of India or the State Government which will not become obsolete within next 3 years). Computer hardware will be supplied as per the norms given in **Annexure –I A**. For the purpose of obsolescence, a 5 years’ life of hardware has been considered.
*   In order to expedite progress of the project and also to take advantage of volume discount, hardware and system software are to be procured centrally (with five years’ comprehensive onsite warranty) with representatives of the State Government being part of the procurement committee. Therefore, a senior level officer having expertise and reasonable knowledge of techno-commercial aspects of procurement of IT goods may be nominated. There will be sufficient representation from States in the Committee set up under the chairmanship of the Joint Secretary (IT) in DAC and comprising representatives from DAC, DAHDF, DARE IFD, NIC and DeitY for procurement of hardware and system software under NeGP-A.
*   **Some States may have another IT initiative or project going on either under a State Government scheme or a programme of the Government of India.** For instance, some States might have got assistance for computerization under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY). Details of any such parallel initiative/scheme may be conveyed to the IT Division of DAC, so that duplication of efforts may be avoided.
*   The States may start planning for site preparation at the State, District and Block levels in accordance with the cost ceiling given in **Annexure–II** in Agriculture, Horticulture and Fisheries Departments as per current readiness and State’s priorities.
*   **The Web based software** (URL: [http://farmer.gov.in/cais/login.aspx](http://farmer.gov.in/cais/login.aspx) ) would be used to facilitate the process of site preparation, delivery,

installation/acceptance testing. The State would be expected to get data pertaining to three important stages at State/District level. Data Entry of all locations at District and other lower level locations within a District shall be done at the District level. Similarly, data entry for Divisional/Zonal, University, State and other similar levels above the District level will be done at the State level.

*   The States may put in place requisite manpower on contract either directly or through identified placement agency. Norms for deploying manpower at various levels and normative emoluments are given as **Annexure-III**.
*   An agency may be finalised by the States for data digitization and localization and also a place in every district headquarter where such data entry will be done. Site preparation charges and requisite IT infrastructure for such data entry will be provided from this Project only. Actual data entry can obviously start only after software modules for this purpose are provided by NIC. Till then, relevant material as per instructions to be issued by the Government of India may be collected and compiled even as process for identifying data-digitisation agency is going on. A sum of Rs. 10 lakhs is earmarked for every State for data entry purposes.
*   In case any of the services (including its sub-components) is already successfully implemented in the State, the same shall be communicated to IT Division, DAC by the concerned States. Similarly details of additional service if any to be developed for the State may also be communicated to IT Division, DAC.
*   States shall nominate a representative from the State Government not below the rank of Commissioner/Director of Agriculture/IT in the Operations Committee headed by the Additional Secretary (IT) in the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India.
*   State Empowered Committee and District NeGP-A Implementation Team shall be constituted by the States as per details indicated in **Annexure – IV**.
*   After installation of hardware by the vendor Acceptance Testing would be carried out as per detailed guidelines as may be framed separately.
*   For Block HQs where power supply is so erratic that a UPS backup of even 4 hours is insufficient, provision for power back up through Solar Panel /Diesel Generators has been provided for in the Scheme. A sum of up to Rupees one lakh per block subject to an upper limit of 33% of total blocks in the State can be provided as per requirements identified by the States. States would however be required to bear the cost of running and maintenance of generator sets. The States can also avail of subsidy provided by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy in case of Solar Panels.
*   Contingency provisions at the rate of 7.5% of overall budget have been made to meet unforeseen requirements. States may project their requirements on a case to case basis to DAC.
*   In addition to the Manpower provided for the State government, a Central PMU will also be established under the project. In addition to the positions of 7 personnel sanctioned in Phase-1 of NeGP-A (i.e. 1 Principal Consultant, 2 Senior Consultants, 3 Consultants and 1 Executive Assistant), 9 more human resources viz. Principal Consultants, Senior Consultants, Consultants and Executive Assistants will also be positioned for Phase-2 of NeGP-A. Ministerial and multi-tasking staff may be deployed on contractual basis out of contingency funds to the support the PMU. These personnel are to be deployed for a period of 3 years or more as per the actual requirement. Actual deployment will take place in a phased manner in keeping with the work-load and numbers of personnel may be ramped up or scaled down or revised depending on need of the Project.

### Duration and Nature of GOI Support under NeGP-A:

*   Hardware and System software with comprehensive onsite warranty for 5 years
*   Basic IT training to end users in various government organisations and Village Level Entrepreneurs in Common Service Centres
*   Full support for site preparation of Training Centres and 55% share for other sites
*   100, 70 and 50 percent for manpower cost for first three years
*   Connectivity charges with SWAN (for intranet & internet) or direct internet connectivity charges for end user locations for a period of 3 Years at an average of Rs. 11000 per location per year. These charges shall be paid for a period of 5 years for Data Centres at Central and State levels.
*   Touch screen kiosks @ 1 in every 2 blocks and 1 in every district
*   An amount of Rs. 7500 per block, Rs.10, 500 per district headquarter and Rs. 30,000 per State head quarter per year has been kept for consumables like printer cartridges etc. for a period of three years.
*   Process and Application Software training
*   Development of core applications and 12 clusters of services
*   Support for IT infrastructure at selected Mandis and integrated e-Mandis
*   Hand-held devices for e-Pest surveillance

### Training

##### Stakeholders Classification

Stakeholders can be classified on the basis of level, role and implementing agencies. This classification is done to group the stakeholders into specific bands for the purpose of identification of training needs. For sake of convenience, officials have been classified into four bands as described below:

**_Band A1:_** This band comprises of employees based at the Centre within the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation and attached offices.

**_Band A2:_** This band comprises of top officials at the State level from all the participating States and resources from their field level attached offices. Additionally, representatives from the State Agricultural University setups would also form a part of this band.

**_Band A3:_** The officers at the District level, who are primarily responsible for implementing the project at the District level and would be required at the front end for service delivery, would form a part of this band. Employees from this band will also act as trainers responsible for training of lower officials, transferred or new officials and conducting refresher courses.

The training of VLEs at CSCs shall also be organised at District level to enable them for implementing NeGP-A initiatives. State will actively involve CSCs in implementing the G2C services effectively. Expenditure on this account will be borne out of item A2 in the Cafeteria of Activities under ATMA Scheme. Such a training will be provided at least twice during 12th Plan period by restricting the expenditure @ Rs. 400 per day (plus lodging charges if any) by treating them as para extension workers..

**_Band A4:_** This band would consist of officials who will be involved in day-to-day activities at the ground level. This band comprises of various resources at the Block / Mandal and village levels. The resources in this band would be directly interfacing with the end beneficiaries on a day-to-day basis and would be required to facilitate the service delivery. These stakeholders would also require to be trained in all the aspects of service delivery as they would be representing the Agriculture MMP to the farmers and businesses at the village level.”

**\*** _Process Training is proposed for functionaries at the state level. This training is proposed to bring in detailed understanding of revised process and procedure for the selected services covered under the project. The process training will detail out the steps of the service process to concerned participants so as to acquaint them and help them understand the revised process. The training will detail out_

_the roles and responsibilities of the concerned participants in the revised processes._

##### Norms for the release for funds:

As per the NeGP-A Norms, an amount of Rs. 1200 per person would be earmarked for the two days of basic training course. This amount is to be utilised towards administrative expenses for the training including TA/DA of the participants.

##### Conduct of Training:

The Implementing Agency (IA) for NeGP-A, will arrange the trainers as well as course material for the trainees. No payments are to be made to them by any State on this account. IA shall design a suitable training feedback form to obtain training feedback and get sign-off on completion of training for each batch. These documents will be signed by the Head of Training Centre where training is being conducted.

##### Training Calendar:

All Training Centres need to be adequately equipped for imparting hands on training to a batch of 20 trainees. States are requested to form and schedule batches as per Training Calendar. It may be ensured that the gap between two successive batches of training is not more than a day (except in case of Sundays and holidays)

### NeGP-A Implementation Strategy

##### Connectivity

States will be responsible for ensuring connectivity of all Agriculture

/Horticulture/ Fisheries offices at District and Block level. First preference will be given to offices through SWAN. However in case it is not feasible then Broadband/Data cards connectivity will be provided. There is a budgetary provision of Rs. 11,000 per year per site (average figure per site for the State) for such sites (not on SWAN) in the project. States will compile and forward details of such locations so that requisite funds could be allotted.

##### Address Details of the Locations

Complete address details of each location where hardware items are to be delivered will be compiled and provided by each State as per format given at NeGP-A website referred to above**.**

##### Testing and Acceptance:

The acceptance testing will be conducted by DAC constituted ATP team along with representatives of Implementing Agency (IA). The purpose of ATP is to ensure that the Hardware Equipment’s as per Bill of Material (BOM) perform at an acceptable level for the users. The ATP would also help in enlisting what has been asked for in the agreement document, verifying that it is delivered and ensuring delivered items have been installed, configured and commissioned. Acceptance Testing Team for the field hardware will consist of two officers /

officials of the office (where hardware has been installed) and representative from IA. As far as possible, officials from State/District unit of NIC / State IT Department / State PMU may also be associated in this task. However, Acceptance Testing should not be delayed only because of non-availability of these technical personnel because AT procedure of field hardware (to be conveyed separately) is simple and comprehensive enough for even a layman to make objective verification based on reports.

##### Help Desk

The operational support shall be provided to the end-users using telephonic and online support through a suitable Helpdesk system during the implementation and warranty period to ensure that the solution is functioning as intended and that all problems associated with day to day operation are resolved satisfactorily. These Help Desk numbers shall be clubbed language- wise. The service will also be available in English. This Helpdesk will also provide online service status tracking facilities to users in respect of their queries. The help desk would be available from 9.00 am till 6.00 pm from Monday to Saturday. At the State level, this support will be in local vernacular language as well.

##### Reporting Physical/Financial Progress

All States will forward Physical/ Financial Progress on the implementation of NeGP-A as per Format given **at NeGP-A website referred to above.**

### Strengthening/Promoting Agricultural Information System

The **National Agriculture Policy (NAP)** lays emphasis on the use of information technology for achieving rapid development of agriculture in India. The thrust of the ICT initiatives is on **e-Governance**, i.e., to make improved services accessible to farmers and other allied groups/stakeholders, using Information and Communication Technology as the facilitator media.

##### Strengthening of IT Apparatus in DAC(HQs)/Field Offices/Directorates.

Computer peripherals and consumables have been supplied to officers and sections (up to the level of Dealing Hands) of DAC Headquarters as per the norms laid down by the Norms Committee on a functional and need basis.

##### Strengthening of IT Apparatus in DAC in the States and UT(AGRISNET)

### Objectives :

The objective of AGRISNET is to provide improved services to the farming community through use of ICT. Since the Scheme is going to be implemented in a projectised mode, the State Governments shall determine the output and deliverables for each project in terms of G2C services. Provision of G2G services would be treated as an intermediate output.

### Implementation Strategy :

*   *   *   *   The AGRISNET Project will be implemented in a projectised mode, i.e. funds under AGRISNET will be provided on the basis of specific project proposals submitted for the purpose.
                *   The State Governments shall propose a road map indicating delivery of G2C services and these should also be explicitly stated in the project proposal.
                *   The State Governments should indicate as to how they intend to deliver the services to the farmers. The delivery points should be identified and indicated in the proposals.
                *   The improvement of services to the farming community through the use of ICT, and not the services per se, would be considered for funding under AGRISNET.
                *   The items / activities eligible for funding under AGRISNET will include :

Hardware and system software (including portable

devices)

Application software

Data entry

Networking

Training of stakeholders (officials of State Agriculture Department, State

Cooperative Department, District Agricultural Officers and Extension workers)

Other specific activities.

Essential miscellaneous costs (not to exceed 10% of the total project cost)

*   *   *   *   *   The following hardware/software, avoiding duplication with other existing infrastructure or with other schemes, would be eligible for funding for setting up of end user hardware:

“The PCs and related hardware/software shall be for the use of officers and staff directly connected with the services being covered under the Project and the states shall assess the realistic requirement of the same at State/district level giving details of such officers and staff.”

*   *   *   *   *   The states shall commit to maintaining the infrastructure created under the project with their own funds after the initial warranty period is over. Initial warranty for the hardware shall be for a maximum period of three year.
                *   Infrastructure for this purpose would include hardware, software, data created and other content developed. Any up-gradation of the infrastructure will have to be done by the State government at its own cost.
                *   The State Government will commit to integrate other National / State level agriculture portals / applications with AGRISNET project. There shall be full convergence between NeGP-A and AGRISNET and no duplication of efforts or overlapping of activities should be done.
                *   The proposal will make a clear commitment that no project fund will be utilized for creation of posts or towards meeting salary / wages of staff.
                *   The States/UTs would be free to choose any agency – public, private, NGO

etc. for implementation of AGRISNET projects. The agency implementing the projects shall follow the prescribed procedures for procurement of hardware

/ software applicable to it, in respect of Government Departments.

*   *   *   *   *   However, the order placed by the procuring agency shall necessarily specify the time within which the selected vendor shall have to supply hardware. This time period shall not exceed three months. After the expiry of the specified period, the order placed with the vendor shall automatically stand cancelled and the procurement process shall start afresh. The tender documents shall suitably include this condition.
                *   The tender document shall also include the condition that prices to be paid for hardware would be that prevailing at the time of delivery of supplies and not at the time orders were placed, in case there has been decline in prices since placement of the order. If the Government of India can indicate better pricing for the same product or better configuration for the same price, the same shall be adopted.
                *   IT Division (DAC) would evolve suitable mechanism to have regular monitoring and independent evaluation of AGRISNET Project.
                *   The State Department of Agriculture are required to have AGRISNET proposals vetted by the State Department of IT before the same are submitted to the DAC for consideration.
                *   To implement the projectised approach, a Committee has been set up in the DAC to develop the guidelines for preparation and subsequent approval of projects. The constitution of this Committee is as given below:-

| (i) | Additional Secretary | Chairperson |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (ii) | Joint Secretary (IT) | Member |
| (iii) | Director (Finance), DAC | Member |
| (iv) | A Representative from the Deptt. of ITnot below the level of Director | Member |
| (v) | A representative of DG, NIC not below the rank of DDG | Member |
| (vi) | Director (IT) | Member Secretary |
| --- | --- | --- |

### Unspent balances with the States:

The State Government will implement the Project in a time bound manner and in case the State does not have definite plan of action to use the same and the state has not already surrendered the amount, the unspent balance available under AGRISNET will be considered as a part of Government of India resources available for NeGP-A.

##### Development of Agricultural Informatics and Communication:

### Development of Portals and Applications:

The objective of this component is to build a reservoir of all data related to agriculture and development of web-based applications. DAC has developed 80 portals, applications and websites (primarily in collaboration with the National Informatics Centre) covering both the headquarters and its field offices/ directorates. The important portals include SEEDNET, DACNET, AGMARKNET (prices and arrivals in Mandis), RKVY (Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana), ATMA, NHM (National Horticulture Mission), INTRADAC, NFSM (National Food Security Mission) and APY (Acreage, Productivity and Yield). DAC is getting the online data entry done right from the district level, so as to expedite the generation of requisite queries and reports in an efficient manner. The Official website of the Department: [www.agricoop.nic.in](http://www.agricoop.nic.in/) is also being revamped, re-designed and updated so as to meet the Government of India Guidelines on Websites (GIGW) guidelines/parameters. Development, strengthening and up-gradation of such portals at central level to benefit all stakeholders throughout the country will continue to be done in a symbiotic manner along with NeGP-A.

### Text and Voice Based Services on Mobile:

The Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, has created a SMS Portal for Farmers. Officers, Scientists and Experts will use this Portal for disseminating

information on various agricultural activities, giving topical & seasonal advisories and providing services through SMSs to farmers in their local languages. SMSs that are sent to the farmers can be broadly classified into three categories, viz. information, services and advisories. The content may include information about the Schemes, Advisories from Experts, Market Prices, Weather Reports, Soil Test Reports etc. The farmers registered for receiving SMS messages have been grouped based on the State, District, Block and the Crops/Activities selected by respective farmers. Grouping of farmers based on their location and their preferred crop/activity will help sending relevant messages to the farmers. The SMS Portal provides **a platform for integration of service delivery under different sectors viz.** Agriculture, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries.

The farmers can register for this service by calling Kisan Call Center on the toll free number 1800-180-1551 or through the web portal. SMS based registration is also provided. Farmer can give up to 8 choices for his preferred crops/activities. This also includes activities under Animal Husbandry, Fisheries & Dairying in addition to Agriculture & Horticulture. Farmers’ preference for Mandi Prices is also recorded. Language preference of the farmers is also being taken based on which the language of the SMS will be determined. This Portal will be strengthened further by introducing other options such as Unstructured Supplementary Services Data (USSD), IVRS, Voice Broadcast (outbound calls), mobile applications (resident and internet based) for various platforms etc.

Financial provision has been made for such mobile based services under NeGP-A as well as Development of Agricultural Informatics and Communication. These will be used in tandem with the scheme of the Department of Electronics and Information Technology. Farm families with increasing percentages are proposed to be covered with messages in broadcast or interactive mode at least with one message every week on an average. Provision has been made for the cost of about 1000 crore messages over the first 3 years of 12th Five Year Plan. Alternatively, number of messages per week can go up if requisite numbers of farm-households do not get registered. Hardware expenditure on SMS Server etc. will be met out of NeGP-A. In addition to SMS services, financial provision has been made for voice services to cover about 20 % of farm households @ 2 calls per year**.**

The amount earmarked under para text and voice based services will be mutually changeable and further subject to modification depending on extent and period of support provided by DeitY under their SMS and Voice Gateways. Number of calls and SMSs may change depending upon actual call and SMSs rates received from the Service Providers.

### Kisan Call Centres (KCCs)

##### Background

To harness the potential of ICT in agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture took a new initiative by launching the scheme “Kisan Call Centres (KCCs)” on January 21, 2004 aimed at answering farmers queries on a telephone call in farmers own dialect. These KCCs located in different parts of the country cater to the farmers from different States and UTs. All KCC locations are accessible by dialling a single nation-wide toll free number 1800-180- 1551 through landline as well as mobile numbers of all telecom networks from 6.00 A.M to 10.00 P.M. on all 7 days a week. With increased awareness amongst farmers, calls at the KCCs have increased over three fold during the last three years and the DAC intends to rapidly enhance coverage of farmers under this most important and convenient tool of agricultural extension. The operations of Kisan Call Centre shall be carried out through a Service Provider, who shall be responsible for establishing requisite infrastructural facilities/manpower and managing the KCCs as per DACs directives.

The DAC aims to have an efficient, effective and a Kisan Call Centre Service based on a dynamic database and regularly updated knowledge (through experts in research and extension system) for each National Agriculture Research Project (NARP) Zone to rapidly enhance successful call inflow by the end of 12th Five Year Plan to such an extent that at least one third of the cultivators calls KCCs once in a year on an average. This will necessitate about 1753 seats (excluding Shift Factor) in the KCCs and corresponding augmentation of IT infrastructure of KCCs.

##### Manpower to be deployed in Kisan Call Centers

The Kisan Call Centre Agents, renamed as Farm Tele Advisors (FTAs) with the prescribed minimum academic qualification in the field of Agriculture and excellent communication skills in respective local language shall attend these calls. These FTAs are considered as Level 1 (L1) support of Kisan Call Centres.

##### Minimum qualification of a FTA will be as follows:

1.  A Graduate or above (i.e PG or Doctorate) in Agriculture or allied (Horticulture Animal Husbandry, Dairying, Fisheries, Poultry, Bee- keeping, Sericulture, Aquaculture, Agricultural Engineering, Agri. Marketing, Biotechnology, Home Science etc. offered by Agricultural/ Horticultural/ Veterinary Universities) disciplines
2.  FTAs should be from the same State. In case eligible candidates from the same state are not available, the Service Provider may appoint a FTA belonging to a neighboring State in the region with proficiency in local language of the State
3.  The FTA must have fluency in the local language/ dialect and shall also have good knowledge of English
4.  Desirable: 1 year experience in agriculture and/or allied sectors

The KCC Service Provider shall appoint FTAs from varied disciplines of agriculture and allied sciences such as Veterinary, Fisheries, Sericulture etc. depending on the number of seats in each KCC and the predominant farming systems prevalent in the state. Representatives of the Government of India and the State Governments concerned will be actively associated in selection of FTAs.

Call Centre Supervisors shall be provided in addition to the FTAs who shall possess a Post-Graduation or higher qualification in Agriculture or Allied

Sciences with at least 2 years experience of working in a Call Centre. A KCC Supervisor, apart from his duties as a KCC Agent, shall also be responsible for liaising with different sstakeholders and resolving the local issues for smooth functioning of the KCC.

##### Service Conditions of FTAs

1.  The Service Provider shall be responsible to fulfill all statutory obligations regarding Employees Provident fund (EPF) and Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) etc. applicable as per norms (to be reimbursed by DAC) for the FTAs deployed at KCCs and shall submit documentary evidence for the same on quarterly basis.
2.  In order to motivate the better performing FTAs and KCC Supervisors, an annual enhancement of 7.5 % of the emoluments shall also be provided (to be paid by DAC) to them subject to continuous & satisfactory service of one year and other criteria to be specified by DAC.
3.  DAC will decide minimum remuneration of the FTAs from time to time.

##### Location of Call Centers

Locations of Kisan Call Centres have been given at [www.farmer.gov.in](http://www.farmer.gov.in/) As far as possible the KCCs shall be located in a State Agricultural University (SAU)/ State Agriculture Department (SAD) or its close proximity. The KCC locations can be increased/ decreased during the plan period depending the requirements for better performance.

##### Kisan Knowledge Management System (KKMS)

A web based portal “_Kisan Knowledge Management System (KKMS)_”, to maintain the database of state wise Agricultural Package of Practices

apart from record of the farmers calling KCC. The KKMS also has links to various schemes of the DAC, Ministry of Agriculture as well as weather related databases. The FTAs shall access KKMS over the Internet, to find instant answer to queries from farmers. Every call would be entered with details of farmers, query of the farmer and answer provided to him.

**Escalation of calls to next higher level will happen automatically after pre-set time limits without FTAs intervention. Besides KKMS, FTAs are required to go through standard books/publications of SAUs/ State Governments, browse Farmers’ Portal & various Scheme Guidelines of DAC and material provided by the DAC for answering farmers’ queries.** Farmer specific information as per KKMS (viz. gist of advice provided during a call and similar other inputs) shall be sent to the farmer by SMS while thanking him for calling KCC.

The Service Provider of KCC would ensure regular training/orientation of the FTAs in use of KKMS application and availability of latest information/ literature on agriculture related issues pertaining to various NARP Zones in the State.

##### Involvement of Common Service Centres (CSCs)

In order to supplement the efforts of FTA, it is envisaged to actively involve the Common Service Centres being established for a cluster of villages by the Department of IT, Government of India. KKMS will be used by these CSCs also.

##### Linkage with the States

1.  The KCCs shall also give a weekly feedback to the State Department of Agriculture & Allied Departments regarding the nature of calls including area specific prevalence of crop diseases, pest infestation etc. In order

to ensure that this is a two-way communication channel, the Commissioner/Director of Agriculture shall ensure that a designated KCC Nodal Officer gets across to the KCC Supervisor periodically.

1.  The States will also closely supervise the quality of extension services provided by the KCC agents. Online monitoring by using Yahoo messenger/Skype id shall also be undertaken.
2.  The States shall keep the KCC agents apprised about new scheme/programmes/contingency plans taken by GOI and State Governments. This will be achieved through monthly interfaces with Divisional/Zonal Officers, experts from SAUs, ICAR Institutes and selected KVKs. The KCC agents would also be provided with latest versions of guide books and booklets brought out by the State Government and the local Agricultural Universities.
3.  Implementation of revised escalation matrix under KKMS and monitoring by higher level on answers given at lower level.
4.  States must organize a massive publicity campaign through both print and electronic media for creating awareness amongst people. Provisions available under ATMA Cafeteria may be utilized for the purpose.
5.  Roster of experts/officers from different disciplines shall be regularly provided to KCC supervisor to facilitate call conference with the experts from different disciplines to reply to the farmers’ queries which the FTA is not able to answer.
