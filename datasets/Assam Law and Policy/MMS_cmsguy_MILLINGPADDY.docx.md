**Incentivization of Milling of Paddy for Enhancement of Paddy Procurement under CMSGUY**

**Introduction:**

The Govt. of Assam started paddy procurement programme under Kharif Marketing Season from 2012-13. Apart from FCI, other agencies namely ASAMB, NAFED, NCCF and NACOF have been operating as procurement agencies in the state. During these years of procurement operation, it has been noticed that Procurement agencies could procure only a fraction of marketable surplus of paddy in the state. The Procurement agencies have been facing extreme difficulties in respect of milling of paddy procured by them. 

**Objective:**

In order to make milling of paddy under KMS a viable proposition for the millers. With financial assistance from CMSGUY, the Assam Food \&Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd. (AFCSCL) proposes to incentivize the milling of paddy by way of paying additional Rs. 25/- per qntl as bonus for milling of Raw Rice and Rs. 15/- per quintal for milling of Par Boiled Rice. This will help in attracting the millers for milling the paddy procured by them under KMS. The incentivisation of milling of paddy will create competitiveness amongst the rice mills. The existing miller will be encouraged to enhance their milling capacity by modernizing mills. Consequently, the procurement agencies will be able to achieve a higher target of procurement so as to achieve the proposed state target of 2.5 Lakh MT and 5 lakh Mt of procurement in next two years respectively. 

**Applicability:**The scheme will be available to all the state and central procurement agencies (FCl, AFCSCL, ASAMB, NACOF, NCCF, NAFED, etc.) notified by the Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department of Govt. of Assam. 

**Nodal Agency:**The scheme will be implemented by the Assam Food & Civil Supplies Corporation ltd. (AFCSCL). The Corporation will place the requirement of fund to the funding agency i.e., from Mega Mission Society- Chief Minister SamagraGramyaUnnayanYojana (MMS-CMSGUY) through Assam Agriculture & Commercial Plantation Mission Society (AACPMS) as per directions of the funding agency.
