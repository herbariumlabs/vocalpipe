**Top Up subsidy for Micro Irrigation Component of PDMC under CMSGUY**

**Introduction:**

The Government of India has been implementing centrally Sponsored Scheme on Micro Irrigation with the objective to enhance water use efficiency in the agriculture sector by promoting appropriate technological interventions like drip & sprinkler irrigation technologies and encourage the farmer to use water saving and conservation technologies. Supplementary Water Management Activities of Per Drop More Crop component under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) scheme during FY 2018-2019 is implemented to reduce the beneficiary’s contribution to 15% of the schematic cost by providing fund from CMSGUY as top up subsidy in order to boost the progress of PMKSY in Assam. This scheme is to be implemented by AACPS-CMSGUY and Dept. of Irrigation.

**Objective:**   
The scheme is mainly based on installation of Micro-irrigation system (Drip and Sprinkler) in the field where water source and delivery system pre-exist. In this scheme, CMSGUY will provide top-up subsidy for implementation of Supplementary Water management Activities (SWMA) of “Per Drop More Crop” component under PMKSY 2018-19. The scheme is proposed to pull additional finance from CMSGUY so that the beneficiaries share can be reduced to 15% of the total cost and to provide assured and timely irrigation to the beneficiary’s field. Hence, a total of 85% subsidy is provided to the farmers by both the central & State Govt.

**Outcome:**

This scheme will help to improve water efficiency by adopting micro irrigation technologies in the fields of the country. This will be a drought proofing activity through creation of the water sources and diversion of water source need to be integrated linked to micro-irrigation. This scheme will benefit almost 28,783 nos. of beneficiaries and approximately 28,627 Ha of total area. the gross irrigated area of the State will substantially increase and farmers will be able to shift from traditional agriculture to high value agriculture especially horticultural crops and earn high income.
