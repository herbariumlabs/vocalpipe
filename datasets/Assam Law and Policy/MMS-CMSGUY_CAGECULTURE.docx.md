**Cage Culture in selected Beels of Assam under CMSGUY**

**Introduction:**  
Assam has maximum number of floodplain wetlands, locally called as Beels and are associated with the river Brahmaputra and Barak. It constitutes an important, most productive and potential fishery resources of the state. There are different reasons for poor fish production from these beels and among them the prominent one is the lack of auto stocking of economically important fish species due to loss of connectivity with the rivers. The other major problems are habitat modification, over exploitation, lack of scientific management, poor community participation in development activities, etc.  
The Cage Culture is a sophisticated technology for production enhancement. The cages are generally enclosed on all sides, except for leaving an opening at the top. Cage aquaculture involves the rowing of fishes in existing water resources while being enclosed in a net cage which allows free flow of water. In view of the high production attainable in cage culture system, it can play a significant role increasing the overall fish production in the state of Assam.

**Objective:**   
The aim of the project are as follows:  
•  Raising of fingerlings for stocking in Beel proper  
• Enhancement of fish production of beels through cage culture thereby enhancing income and livelihood security to the resource users and create alternative livelihood during fishing banned period by raising fish seeds and production of table fish through cage culture technique.   
• Dissemination of in situ fish seed rearing technology and production of table fish in cages to the end users and nearby beel users.  
• Sustainable development of beels by involving community people in the development process of cage culture   
•  Increase per capita consumption of fish for resource users and other stakeholders  
•  Productive utilization of existing resource.	

**Advantages of cage culture:**

* Suitable device for effective utilization of beels or such type of water bodies.  
* Cost of construction and operation is very less and hence relatively low initial investment is required.  
* Complete and easy harvesting without any cost.   
* Direct and easy observation of stock for feeding, growth and general health check-up.  
* Less manpower requirement.  
* Found to be most effective in flood affected area  
* Reducing pressure on land for farm and nurseries.  
* High return on investment in short period   
* Generation of job opportunities for unemployed youth and women.  
* Additional income to fishers during closed seasons.  
* No crop loss during flood and drought like situation.  
* High return on investment in short period.
