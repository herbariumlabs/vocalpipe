EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

State Irrigation Plan, Assam, 2022-27  
The State of Assam, endowed with rich water resources through its vast river networks and aquifers,has historically relied on agriculture as the backbone of its economy. However, recurrent floods, dry spells, and erratic rainfall patterns hinder optimal agricultural productivity. The State Irrigation Plan (SIP) 2022-2027 aligns with the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) and aims to significantly expand Assam's irrigation coverage and enhance water management practices across its diverse agro-climatic zones.

Importance of the Plan  
Water management is critical for Assam's agricultural sustainability, as irrigation serves as a lifeline for crop growth in a predominantly agrarian economy. As of 2022, Assam's net irrigated area covers only 21.54% of its total sown area (CCA), markedly lower than the national average of 49.92%. This SIP seeks to elevate Assam's irrigation coverage to 52 % by 2027 through both revival of existing schemes and the implementation of new, sustainable initiatives. The plan reflects Assam's commitment to achieving food security, increasing rural employment, and bolstering economic growth in a changingclimate.

Irrigation Potential in the State  
The state of Assam has Net Sown area of 28.62 Lakh Ha. and Gross Cropped area of 40 Lakh Ha. respectively. Though the Irrigation Potential Created up to March, 2022 is shown as 10.59 Lakh-Ha in the Statistcial Handbook of Assam, 2022, but all the schemes as reflected in the said handbook donot exist at present. This SIP is prepared on the basis of IPC created up to March 2022 through existing schemes only. Therefore, the Annual Irrigated Area (AIA) created up to March'22 is 8.27 Lakh Ha asper State Irrigation Plan, 2022-27.

Financial Overview and Component Allocation  
The total projected budget for SIP 2022-2027 is Rs.36,406.00 Crore allocated for implementation of new schemes and revival of existing schemes along with command area development.  
The majority of the budget focuses on expanding irrigation infrastructure, enhancing water use efficiency, and supporting conjunctive use of both surface and groundwater resources.  
The district wise allocation of budget for the targeted plan period 2022-27 is as under: \-

Total	3640579  
District-wise Implementation and Strategic Focus  
The SIP spans 32 districts, with individual District Irrigation Plans (DIPs) developed and approved at the district level to ensure locally relevant and customized solutions. These DIPs include a detailed projection of district-wise irrigation potential, along with a breakdown of proposed schemes.  
For example, the Upper Brahmaputra Valley Zone, with its annual flooding issues, will receive focused investments in flood-resilient irrigation systems, while the Barak Valley Zone, which experiences periodic droughts, will benefit from enhanced groundwater extraction techniques and rainwater harvesting structures.  
Monitoring, Evaluation, and Innovation  
A comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) framework strengthen SIP 2022-2027, ensuring that project milestones are met, resources are optimally utilized, and corrective measures are taken as needed. The M\&E system will track both quantitative outputs, such as area irrigated, and qualitative impacts, like changes in crop yield and water use efficiency.  
To encourage innovation, the SIP advocates for solar-powered pump installations under PM KUSUM, with a target of 10,000 pumps across Assam. The adoption of drip and sprinkler irrigation systems ispromoted to enhance water conservation, and water user associations will be formed to ensure community participation in irrigation management.  
Addressing Climate Challenges and Future Outlook  
Assam is highly vulnerable to climate change, with rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns. The SIP incorporates climate adaptation strategies, such as the use of drought-tolerant crop varietiesand flood-resistant infrastructure. By improving water storage, expanding irrigation access, and increasing cropping intensity, the plan aims to make Assam's agriculture more resilient to climate variability.  
The successful implementation of the SIP will rely on sustained financial and policy support from both state and central governments, as well as strong partnerships with local communities and agricultural stakeholders. Achieving these goals will enable Assam to not only meet its food security needs but also foster a more sustainable and prosperous rural economy.  
Conclusion  
The Assam State Irrigation Plan (2022-2027) offers a comprehensive framework to enhance irrigation coverage, promote sustainable practices, and build climatic balance. Through strategic investments,collaboration among key departments, and community involvement, Assam aims to create a robust agricultural system that will support its economy and improve the quality of life for its people. With dedicated implementation, the SIP will not only bolster food security but also pave the way for a moreprosperous and sustainable rural landscape in Assam.  
Introduction

Assam is endowed with enormous water resources. The large perennial rivers and other water bodies with the rich aquifer speak about vastness of its water resource. Surface water is available in the forms of river, stream, lake, swamps, pond etc. A large percentage of water is used for agriculture annually. Irrigation requires large quantities of water to grow various crops and sustain livestock.

In an agrarian economy like India, agriculture utilizes the major share of country's exploitablewater resources. Though the sector utilizes the maximum share of exploitable water resources, availability of the same at different locations to different extent makes it vital to adopt effective utilization of water through storage, channelizing and judicious use. At some places like Punjab and Haryana, the environmental and socio-economic rationale for this capture by the sector is now being questioned. Accordingly, it is needed to challenge and change the fundamentals of the prevailing view on water resources exploitation. A new and more suitable approach to water resources allocation is necessary if the population is to be adequately fed, without further degradation and destruction of the critical ecosystem services. Water needs to be enhanced considerably and economic cost-benefit analysis and pricing regimes can play a significant role in such a process. However, these economic measures will not be sufficient on their own. They will need to be buttressed by technological innovation and institutional changes in order to encourage a more equitable distribution of resources and to mitigate potential intra/international conflicts across shared water basins. Proper usage of water is important to manage crop yield and productivity. Farmers should follow water conservation strategies for sustainable agriculture. Agricultural water comes from surface water (rivers, streams, open canals, ponds, reservoirs and lakes), groundwater from wells and rainwater. Water is used in all traditional agriculture methods including the cultivation of rice, wheat, sugarcane, etc.  
The economy of Assam is agriculture-based. Tea, rice, sugarcane, are the main agriculturalcrops grown in the state of Assam, with tea being is the largest agricultural industry.  
Rice is the most dominant crop followed by vegetables, pulses, oilseeds, etc. The productivityof all these crops are to be increased to match the national average. Among the horticulture crops Banana, Citrus, Pineapple, Areca nut, Coconut are grown by the farmers. Apart from agricultural crops sericulture food plants also cover a sizeable area. Generally, Sali rice, Ginger, Turmeric, Sericulturefodder plants, sugarcane, etc. are also practiced in the state.  
The state of Assam has Net Sown area of 28.62 Lakh Ha. and Gross Cropped area of 40 Lakh Ha. respectively.  
Annual Irrigated Area (AIA) up to March'22 is 8.27 Lakh Ha.

The economy of Assam is largely rural and agrarian inhabited by 35.37 million people with Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) at current prices during 2023 is estimated as 5.67 lakh crores(Cr.) with per capita income of Rs. 1,18,504 against Rs. 1,70,620 per capita income in India (2023). The state has agrarian economy, which contributes 25% to the net domestic product of the state and provides livelihood support to about 70% of the population. Thus, the agricultural GDP of the state isestimated to be 1.42 Lakh Cr. During the last 15 years, Assam's GDP grew at an average annual  
growth rate of 5.4%. (Source: 1st Report of The Agriculture Commission and Interim Recommendations (2022-23)) Despite being endowed with diverse soil and climatic conditions, Assam suffers vagaries of nature, especially unseasonal floods and dry spells that regularly wreaks havoc on crop land. In addition, chronic flood and river bank erosion affect large portions of the Brahmaputra & Barak Valley, resulting in loss of agricultural land and crop loss. On the other hand, the agriculture sector in the hilldistricts of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao is suffering from various weaknesses like low infrastructural facilities, low productivity due to extensive Jhum cultivation, non-availability of markets, etc. The pattern of cultivation, agricultural infrastructure development and  
access to markets in these two hilly terrainsare special areas of concern.  
History of Irrigation in Assam:  
Subsequent to the devastating flood in 1954, the necessity of setting up ofa dedicated department dealing with water resources in the State was strongly felt. All Irrigation activity in Assam was undertaken by Agriculture Department until 1968\. It was only in 1970 that the Brahmaputra Flood Control Commission as well as Flood Control & Irrigation Department was formed. At that time this Flood Control and Irrigation Department was entrusted with the Flood Control works in the Barak Valley and irrigation works in the entire State including survey, investigation, planning, designing and execution of irrigation schemes and their operation and maintenance. Subsequently, this department was renamed as Public Works (Flood Control & Irrigation) Department, Assam and the flood control works of Brahmaputra Valley was entrusted to the department. With the introduction of High Yielding Variety crops, the demand of irrigation started gaining momentum and finally in 1974, the present Irrigation Department was born by bifurcating the Public Works (Flood Control & Irrigation) Department and amalgamating the engineering wing of the Agriculture Department along with the Irrigation schemes constructed by the Agriculture Department to deal exclusively with the irrigation development of the State.

Assam's Irrigation at a Glance  
Irrigation is the process of applying water to the crops artificially to fulfill their water requirements. The Department executes the works of Irrigation schemes, operates and also maintains them.  
The major activities of the department are:  
    \- To increase Agricultural production of the State by ensuring timely and adequate irrigationwater to the fields to cultivate variety of crops.  
    \- To increase irrigation intensity by ensuring water throughout the year and thereby encouraging multiple cropping.  
    \- Utilization of irrigation potential by equitable distribution of water through command area development.  
    \- Rendering assistance to form Water User's Association.  
    \- Collection of Irrigation service charge from the beneficiaries, etc.  
The erstwhile planning commission, GoI adopted the following classification of Irrigation Schemes:-  
    a) Major irrigation Scheme  
        ? Major irrigation schemes are those schemes which have a Culturable Command Area(CCA) of more than 10,000 hectares.  
    b) Medium irrigation Schemes  
        ? Medium Irrigation Schemes are those which have a Culturable Command Area of2,000-10,000 hectares.  
    c) Minor Schemes  
        ? Minor irrigation schemes are those schemes which have a Culturable Command Area up to2000 hectares.

Irrigation system practiced by the Department at present are:-  
    a) Flow Irrigation Scheme (FIS)  
        ? By constructing diversion structures like weir, barrages across the river or perennial streams for diverting river/stream water to its command area through canal system.  
    b) Lift Irrigation Scheme (LIS)  
        ? By installing electrical operated pumps and motors in the river bank pump houses or on thefloating barges to lift the water from the river or water body to irrigate the command area through water distribution system.  
    c) Tube Well Scheme  
        ? By installing electrical or solar operated submersible pumps in the Deep Tube Well(DTW)/Medium Deep Tube Well (MDTW)/Shallow Tube Well (STW) to draw ground water for irrigating cropped land, where FIS or LIS is not feasible.

IRRIGATION STATUS OF ASSAM COMPARED WITH INDIA AVERAGE  
    1\. The Net Irrigated Area as a %age of Total Area under Agriculture (NIA/Net Sown Area) in the State in 2022 is 21.54 % compared to India average (as on 2017-18) of 49.92%. Top States in terms of the same are \-  
\-- 1\. Punjab (99.95%), 2\. Haryana (92.72%), 3\. UP (86.64%), 4\. MP (69.49%), 5\. Bihar (59.23%).

    2\. The Total Irrigated Area as a %age of Total Area under Agriculture (AIA/Gross Cropped Area) in the State in 2022 is 20.67 % compared to India average (as on 2017-18) of 50.05%. Top States in terms of the same are \--- 1\. Punjab (98.48 %), 2 . Haryana (91.57%), 3\. UP (80.39%), 4\. Bihar (71.95%), 5\. W. Bengal  
(65.17%).

This comparison shows the picture of Irrigation sector in Assam, a lot of work and investment have to be made in Irrigation sector in the State.  
In the Plan period 2022-27, it is targeted to bring the Irrigated Area in the State to nearabout 52  
%.

Necessity of SIP:  
Water has unique characteristics that determine both its allocation and use as a resource in agriculture. Agricultural use of water for irrigation is itself contingent on land resources. In a situation of growing water scarcity and rising demands for non-agricultural (household and industrial) use of water, reassessment of sectoral allocations of water are inevitable. In developing countries, irrigated agriculture plays a vital role in contributing towards domestic food security and poverty alleviation. Irrigation helps improve food security, reduce dependence on monsoons, improve agricultural productivity and create rural job opportunities. Therefore, achievement of these objectives is dependent on adequate allocations of water to agriculture. Improved allocation of irrigation water is required within the agriculture sectors in order to achieve greater efficiency in the use of irrigation water and existingirrigation infrastructure. Reallocation is also required in order to reduce water logging and salinization of irrigated land, to decrease the negative environmental impacts and other externalities of irrigation (caused by over extraction of groundwater and depletion and pollution of surface water).  
In terms of irrigation, enough scope is available in the State to catch up states like Punjab, Haryana, and Gujarat by substantial margin. Focused efforts would be needed. Besides, regional variation would also require special focus in terms of creating irrigation facilities. In order to cope up with the food deficit caused by growth in population and to ensure food security, multiple cropping with irrigation support is highly necessary.  
Also, as per first report of the Agriculture Commission and Interim Recommendations (2022-2023), the commission recommended the following in connection with Irrigation in the State:-  
    \- Increase irrigation potential by 1Mha (3000 Crore) financial aid from GoI.  
    \- Install solar powered pumps, 50 in each block (10,000) under PM KUSUM Yojana (30% GoI,30% GoA and 40% by Bank Loan with 3% interest subvention each by GoI and GoA. Rest paid by the farmers/FPOs/FPCs), state's share (100 Crore).  
    \- The Commission also suggested to increase cropping intensity to 165% by 2027 and 175% by2030. (Source: 1st report of the Agriculture Commission and interim recommendations 2022-2023)  
Therefore, five year (2022-27) District Irrigation Plans (DIPs) for 32 nos. of districts are prepared and are approved by District Level Sanctioning Committee (DLSC) headed by the respective District Commissioners.

From the District Irrigation Plans, the State Irrigation Plan (SIP) is prepared and is approved by the Technical Committee formed vide Govt. order no. E-271932/13, dtd: 13-10-2023.

The decadal growth rate of the state population during 2001-2011 was 17.07% against 17.68% growth for the country as a whole. Out of total population in the state, 86% population lived in rural areas and 14% population in urban areas. The percentage of rural populatio n of the state was higher than all India average (69%). However, the urban population in the state had increased from 12.9% in 2001 to 14% in 2011\. The density of population of Assam in 2011 was 398 person per sq.km. as compared to 340 persons in 2001\. The sex ratio (number of female per thousand male) of Assam had increased to 958 in 2011 from 935 in 2001\. Compared to overall sex ratio of the state, the child sex ratio (age group 0-6 years) had gradually declined from 975 in 1991 to 967 in 2001 and further to 962 in 2011\. On the other hand, sex ratio at birth in Assam as per 2011 census was 957\.

        1.3. Agro Ecology, Climate, Hydrology and Topography of Assam  
The state of Assam is divided into two valleys namely- Brahmaputra valley and Barak valley. A significant geographical aspect of Assam is that it contains three of six physiographic divisions of India  
            ? The Northern Himalayas (Eastern Hills), The Northern Plains (Brahmaputra plain), and the DeccanPlateau (Karbi Anglong).  
Assam has been broadly divided into six agro-climatic zones on the basis of patterns of rainfall, terrain, soil type and climatic conditions. They are \-

                1\. North Bank Plains Zone,  
                2\. Upper Brahmaputra Valley Zone,  
                3\. Central Brahmaputra Valley Zone,  
                4\. Lower Brahmaputra Valley Zone,  
                5\. Barak Valley Zone and  
                6\. Hills Zone.  
Figure below presents a map of Assam with these six agro-climatic zones.

        1.4 Soil Profile  
The soils of Assam are very rich in nitrogen content and organic matter. The alluvial soils of the Brahmaputra and the Barak valley are highly fertile and are highly suitable for raising of crop varieties round the year such as cereals, pulses, oilseeds, plantation crops, etc. The well-drained, deep, acidic alluvial soils of upper Assam with good proportion of phosphoric content are very suitable for the plantation crops. New alluvial soils occurring in the char lands (riverine areas of the Brahmaputra rive r formed either in the heart of the river or on its banks) are most suitable for growing oilseeds, pulses and Rabi crops. The alluvium of the plains offers excellent opportunity for cultivating rice and vegetables.The soil available in the upper reaches of the hill slopes are highly suitable for horticulture and plantation crops.  
Brahmaputra Valley \- The most predominant soil type found in the sub-basin is the red loamy soil and alluvial soil. Other important soil types are \- sandy, loamy, clayey soils, their combinations and laterite soil. The culturable area of the sub-basin is about 12.15 M-Ha. which is 6.2% of the culturable area of the country.  
Here's a detailed description of the Soil Profile of the Brahmaputra Valley \-  
    1\. Alluvial Soils: Dominantly, the soils in the Brahmaputra Valley are alluvial, deposited by the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries. These soils are young and fertile, frequently replenished by annual floods, which enhance their nutrient content, making them highly productive for agriculture.

    2\. Texture Variability: The soil texture in this region varies from sandy to silty to clayey loam. This variation allows for a diverse range of crops to be cultivated, from rice in the more clayey and loamy areas, which require more water, to vegetables and fruits in sandier soils, which provide better drainage.  
    3\. Slightly Alkaline to Neutral pH: Unlike the acidic soils of the Barak Valley, the Brahmaputra Valley soils are generally slightly alkaline to neutral. This pH range is conducive to most agricultural crops and requires less amendment than more acidic soils.  
    4\. Rich in Nutrients: Due to the constant deposition of river sediments during floods, these soilsare rich in macro and micronutrients. Key nutrients include phosphorus, potassium, and a range of trace minerals beneficial for crop growth.  
    5\. Organic Matter Content: The organic matter content in the Brahmaputra Valley soils is moderate, contributed by the decomposition of plant and animal residues. The organic content can vary depending on the location and the extent of flooding, which can wash away topsoil in some areas while depositing new layers in others.  
    6\. Issues with Erosion and Flooding: While the annual floods replenish soil nutrients, they also pose challenges such as soil erosion and occasional excessive waterlogging, which can adversely affect crop yields. Effective soil conservation and water management strategies are crucial to counter these effects.  
    7\. Suitability for Multiple Cropping: The soil profile, coupled with the valley's ample water supply, makes it ideal for multiple cropping systems. Farmers in the Brahmaputra Valley typically grow a variety of crops throughout the year, maximizing the use of the fertile soils.  
The Brahmaputra Valley's soils are thus central to the agricultural prosperity of Assam, supporting a broad spectrum of crops and sustaining the livelihoods of a significant portion of the state's population. However, managing the dual challenges of flooding and erosion is crucial for the sustainable use of these rich alluvial soils.  
Barak Valley \- The Barak valley consists of three administrative districts namely \- Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi. The soil of the district is clayey loam, alluvial and red alluvial. The soil is highly porous and therefore, lacks moisture retention capacity and is susceptible to erosion. The water level in the district is very low. The Barak Valley in Assam, while predominantly known for its fertile plains along the Barak River, also features hilly terrains that influence the region's soil profile and land use.  
Detailed description of the Soil Profile of Barak Valley:  
Plains:  
        ? Texture and Fertility: The plains are covered with alluvial soils, which are soft and fine- textured, composed of sandy loam, silty loam, and clay loam. These soils are highly fertile due to the rich nutrients and organic matter deposited by the Barak River and its tributaries.

        ? Water Retention: These soils retain water well, making them ideal for water-intensive cropslike rice. The good water retention also supports the cultivation of tea, fruits, and vegetables.  
        ? pH Levels: The soils are slightly acidic to neutral, suitable for a wide range of crops.  
        ? Erosion Risks: Soil erosion is minimal due to the flat terrain, though riverine activities may sometimes affect soil stability.  
Hills:  
        ? Texture and Fertility: The soil in the hilly regions is generally rougher, with a mix of loam and clay, and often contains stones and gravel. These soils are less fertile because they drain water quickly, and nutrients are often washed away by rain.  
        ? Water Retention: The hilly soils have poorer water retention due to their sloped nature, making them less ideal for crops like paddy but good for plantation crops such as tea, which prefer well-drained soils.  
        ? pH Levels: These soils are more acidic than those in the plains, a condition exacerbated bythe high organic acid from decomposing vegetation and less nutrient retention.  
        ? Erosion Risks: Erosion is a significant concern in the hills, especially during heavy rains. The steep slopes increase runoff, leading to loss of topsoil.

            1.4.1 Soil Erosion Status  
Soil erosion is a serious problem in Assam. The highly productive and fertile soils of Assam are now facing the serious problem of soil erosion like other parts of the country. Riverbank erosion during high flood period in the valley is a regular annual feature. The extent of loss to the bank erosion varies from year to year depending on the severity of floods in the state. The catchment of the Brahmaputra is characterized by very steep hill slopes with coarse soil texture and unstable land mass. This causeshigh instantaneous run-off and heavy siltation in the tributaries as well as in the channels of the mainriver. It is also frightening that the mighty river is drifting its course towards southern bank and causing sedimentation in the north bank. Excessive water flow, sloppy nature of cultivated land, cutting & clearing of Jungle from the catchments of rivers & canal, flash flood & its meandering nature are some of the major cause of soil erosion in various districts of the State. Karimganj, Morigaon, Goalpara, Nalbari and Charaideo are some of the most affected districts of the State.  
        1.5 Land-Use  
Land utilization in a given region is one of the most important factors as the production and productivity of different crops mainly depend upon the availability of land or the distribution of land among different crops. Due to increase in developmental activities in recent years, more and more land is being used for industrial, housing, transport and recreation purposes. This has resulted in an increase in the area used up by non-agricultural uses. Land-use pattern in Assam indicates that out of

the total geographical area of 78.438 lakh hectares, the Gross Cropped Area (GCA) of Assam is40 lakh hectares.

        1.6 Agriculture Status and Opportunities  
Agriculture in Assam exhibits most of the characteristics of under-developed / backward agriculture \- high dependence on agriculture for livelihood, widespread practice of traditional farming techniques, low usage of modern farm inputs, inadequate agricultural infrastructure, low levels of productivity and incomes in the sector and so on. About 75% of the State's population is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture while about 69% of the workforce is actually engaged in agricultural activities. About 86% of the farmers belong to small and marginal groups while the average operational holding size is a low 1.10 hectares. Hence, agriculture and its allied activities play an important role in the socio \-economic development of Assam and provides livelihood to a significant proportion of the population of the State. Agriculture, being the main source of livelihood of the rural population is the mainstay of the State's economy.

        1.7 Irrigation in Assam  
There is a considerable potential for agricultural growth in the State by increasing cropping intensity, raising crop yield and diversifying into pulses and oilseeds through irrigation. During Kharifseason, uncertainty in crop production occurs due to onslaught of natural calamities like flood, storm etc. and uneven rainfall distribution. Rabi crops do not get priority in all areas and also less practiced by the farmers. Therefore, assured Irrigation along with motivation of farmers in the State is most essential.  
Challenges for Development of Irrigation in Assam \-  
    \- Uneven topography of the State.  
    \- Change of river course in respect of Surface Flow and Surface Lift Irrigation Schemes.  
    \- Motivation of cultivators to adopt multiple cropping system in their crop field where assured irrigation is available with high yielding variety crops (HYV)  
    \- Farmers with small landholdings

Approach towards maximum utilization of existing irrigation facilities \-  
For maximum utilization of existing irrigation facilities, both Irrigation & Agriculture Deptt. can formulate strategies for :  
    \- Motivating farmers for optimum utilization of irrigation water.  
    \- Motivating farmers to adopt the practice of multiple cropping, as well as crop rotation.  
    \- Adopting right crops for right soil.  
    \- Adopting low water consuming crops.  
Challenges of Irrigation in Assam \-  
    \- To ensure availability of sufficient fund for upkeepment of the schemes.  
    \- To protect the schemes from onslaught of natural calamities like flood, storm etc.  
    \- To make provision for uninterrupted power supply for adequate hours to the electricallyoperated schemes (Surface Lift and Ground Water Lift) during crop season  
    \- To make fund available for immediate repair of damaged canals, transformer, HT line and mechanical components at the peak period of irrigation.

State Water Profile

        2.1 Assam's Water Profile  
Water is a natural resource, a fundamental need of the living being and an invaluable national wealth. Planning, development and management of water resources need to be governed by national perspectives. Under the Constitution, water resource is primarily a 'State Subject', with legislation and administration substantially framed within the context of next boundaries. In the developmental planning of any State, water is decisive and multifaceted component. The geology has endowed the State with many hills and rivers. These have tremendous influence on the soil quality, drainage pattern, land-use, vegetation pattern, population pattern, culture etc. The State can be divided into three distinctive parts- the first one being long and narrow, is the Brahmaputra valley or Assam valley. The river Brahmaputra flowsfrom east to west for about 640 km within the state and has a crucial role in land formation, hydrology, ecology, demography, culture and economy of the valley and the state. The Barak, and another large river of the state, has created the Barak Valley in the southern end of the state. The Barail range and Karbi Plateau separate these two river system.  
Surface Water  
Apart from the rain water received, the State is endowed with number of perennial rivers and lakes locally known as beels. The State is drained by a dense network of two river systems \- the Brahmaputra and the Barak. These rivers have large number of tributaries joining them from both the banks. There are about 20 important tributaries in the north bank and 13 in the south bank of the Brahmaputra River whereas thereare 11 important tributaries of the Barak River forming the drainage network in Assam. The vast potential surface water resource of the State is not yet properly utilized. In the last few decades, the rate of Consumption of water in the agricultural sector, industrial sector and in the urban centers has increasedsignificantly. The discharges of untreated domestic wastewater, industrial wastewater, runoff from the agricultural fields and the urban sewage water posing threat to the water bodies of the State.  
    (a) River Systems  
Brahmaputra and Barak river systems are central to the State's water economy. The former is among the largest on earth in terms of discharge and sediment and is intrinsic to the socio-cultural life in Assam. It is Assam's lifeline, nurturing its topography and culture and sustaining major urban centers, including Guwahati, on its banks. The details of the two river systems follow.  
        (i) Brahmaputra River System  
The Brahmaputra is one of the largest rivers in the world by discharge. The Brahmaputra basin covers an area of 580000 sq. km of which 194413 sq.km. falls in India in the States of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam,Nagaland, Meghalaya, Sikkim and West Bengal. Brahmaputra is a perennial river, fed by snow as well as by rain. It rolls down the plains of Assam east to west for a distance of 640 km up to Bangladesh border.Through its course, the river receives innumerable tributaries (about 33\) coming out of the northern, northeastern and the southern hill ranges. The mighty river with a well-knit network of tributaries drains an area of 56,480 sq. km of the State accounting for 72% of its total geographical area. Most of the right bank tributaries of Brahmaputra are snow as well rain-fed and are perennial. Although the left bank tributaries

are mainly rain-fed, they still are perennial in nature. It is the fourth largest river in the world in terms of average water discharge at the mouth with a flow of 19,830 cumec. The river carries 82% of the annualflow during the rainy season (May through October).  
        (ii) Barak River System  
Barak is the second largest river system in North East India as well as in Assam. The river, with a total length of 900 km from source to mouth, drains an area of 52,000 sq. km. in India and traverses a distance of 532 km up to the Indo- Bangla border. Like Brahmaputra, the Barak is also a perennial river of Assam.The important north bank tributaries of Barak River are Jiri, Sini, Madhura, Jatinga and Larang, while the important south bank tributaries include Sonai, Ghagra, Katakhal, Dhaleswan, Singla and Longai. The flows of the rivers in Assam decrease considerably during the dry season. They maintain peak flow in rainy months.  
    (b) Wetlands & Water Bodies  
The valley of the river Brahmaputra, with its innumerable fresh water lakes (locally called beel), or ox bow lakes (era suti), marshy tracts and seasonally flooded plains and hundreds of riverine sandbars and islands was till recently an ideal wetland eco-system. However, the advent of water hyacinth has spelt doom.  
Likewise, raising of embankments along the banks of almost the entire length of the river and many of itstributaries has cut off the periodic flushing out of the wetlands by the monsoon flood. The third and the final onslaught on the wetlands has taken place with the arrival of the human settlers in the sand-bars and the minor riverine islands, mostly in lower Assam. This has turned the wetlands into agricultural zones rich in rice and vegetables but rendered those denuded of biodiversity. It is imperative that these wetlands areconserved. If properly managed, the wetlands could be a source of immense wealth for Assam.  
During the 1st census of water bodies, 24,24,540 nos. of water bodies have been enumerated inthe country. In Assam the number of water bodies is enumerated as 1,72,492 and is among the top fivestates in the number of water bodies having 7.1% of country's water bodies. In Assam, 97.69% (1,68,520 nos.) are ponds ,0.13% (225 nos.) are tanks, 0.057% (100 nos.) are reservoirs whereas remaining 2.11% (3,647 nos.) are water conservation schemes/check dams/percolation tanks, lakes and other water bodies.  
Some of the important wetlands under this category are Deepor beel in Kamrup district, Dhir beel in Dhubri district, Tamaranga beel and Dalani beel in Bongaigaon.

Ground Water

Along with huge surface water resources, the state has Annual Extractable Ground Water (GW) resource of 20.93 BCM. The Total Annual Groundwater Recharge of the State has been estimated as 27.26 BCM. Hence, current annual gross GW extraction for all use is 2.63 BCM. Out of 245 assessment units, 244 have been categorized as 'Safe' and one assessment unit of Kamrup (Metro) Urban is in 'Semi Critical' condition. There is no saline area in the state. As per 2022 assessment, the Total Annual Ground WaterRecharge for the State is 26.53 BCM in 2022, Annual Extractable Ground Water Resources is 21.40 BCM and Total Ground Water Extraction is 2.65 BCM.  
(All GW data source: Draft Report on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2023).

            2.1.1 Agricultural Crops & Production in Assam  
Assam accounts for a fairly significant share of the country's farm acreage and output of many crops. Notable are paddy, rapeseed and mustard, jute and tea, potato, banana, papaya, areca nut and turmeric. Tea is the pride of Assam and not only is it the largest producer of tea in the county, it also accounts forabout 14% of the world's tea output. Assam has also emerged as an important producer in the country in many crops such as sweet potato, banana, papaya, chillies, turmeric, cabbage, cauliflower, brinjal, lemon, orange and pineapple even though less than one per cent of the cropped area in Assam is being used for cultivating each of them. There is, thus, tremendous scope for pushing the acreage under these crops and, in general, vegetables, fruits and spice crops. All of these are high-value crops widely considered to have enormous potential for Commercialization.  
Assam, having diverse and unique agro-climatic conditions, is naturally rich in horticultural production and enjoys a conducive environ for growing a wide variety of horticultural crops like differenttypes of fruits, vegetables, flowers, spices, nut crops, tuber crops, medicinal and aromatic plants, mushrooms, etc. In fact, Assam is already one among 14 global biodiversity hotspots. The state has enough options for farming as well as making investments in horticulture sector. Moreover, the sector also has the capacity of offering enough opportunities for employment generation of unemployed youths of the state.

2.3. Irrigation Based Classification  
The economy of Assam is predominantly agriculture based. The total geographical area of the State is 78,438 km2. In order to cope up with the food deficit caused by growth in population and to ensure food security, multiple cropping with irrigation support is highly necessary. Moreover, due to global warming, ecological imbalance and erratic monsoon, the rainfall is not taking place at right time to help the agricultural practices. As such irrigation input is found to be the only alternative which can provide right amount of water at right time to carry out agricultural activity. The total gross irrigated area of Assam is 1237657 Ha and the net irrigated area was found to be 822215 Ha.

Water Availability in Assam

        3.1 Overview of Water Resources in Assam

            3.1.1 Rainfall

Bulk of the water in the State, both surface and groundwater is obtained from rainfall. Assam experiences the predominant influence of the south-west tropical monsoon which reigns from April to October with occasional winter showers. The low clouds of the southwest monsoon after being intercepted by the North Cachar Hill range and Naga Patkai range, cause heavy rainfall in the southern part of Assam and also intercepted by eastern Himalayan range, resulting precipitation in the Brahmaputra valley; their intensity increasing towards the foothills of the Himalayas. The approach of the monsoon begins duringApril and May and starts its full play of heavy showers from June. The water availability in various districts of Assam is shown in the Table-3.1(a).

In terms of volume, since a rainfall of 1 mm would translate into 1 litre of rainwater every squaremeter of 10,000 litres per hectare, a rainfall of 1906 mm would translate into 1906 litres of rain water every square meter or 19.06 million litres per hectare or 1.906 hectare meter (one hectare meter of water is equal to 10 million litres or 1.906 hectare meter /0.1906 square km is equal to 19.06 million litres). Thus, for the State as a whole with the total geographical area of 78,438 square kilometers (or 78,43,800 hectares) which would be the catchment area, the gross volume of water through the average annual rainfall would be 19.06 million litres X 78,43,800. Even if 20% of the above precipitation is discounted towards evaporation, runoff and transpiration, there would still be enough water coming through rainfall providedthere is no heterogeneous or skewed rainfall distribution. Thus, the amount of rainfall in Assam is adequate for suitable runoff, accumulation and ground water recharge, compared to many other States of India.

            3.1.2 Ground Water Resources  
Ground water plays a key role in meeting the water needs of various user-sectors in India. Therehas been a growing dependability on ground water as a sustainable resource. In India, more than 90% of the rural population and nearly 30% of the urban population depend on groundwater for drinking purpose. Ground water is replenished naturally by surface water from precipitation, streams and rivers. However, unplanned urbanization coupled with rapid population growth has started exerting tremendous pressureboth on the surface and sub-surface water resources. Unprecedented population growth affects the hydrological cycle resulting in less sub-surface infiltration rate and higher volume of surface water runoff. Assam is one of the rich States of the country in terms of the ground water development potentiality. The entire Brahmaputra valley, covering more than 70% of the total geographical area of the State, containsprolific aquifer system with water table lying within 5 m of land surface. The Barak valley also has a good potential for development of ground water. The present stage of ground water development, even in theBrahmaputra valley which is the most populous part of the State, is nothing but in a nascent stage. Hydro geologically, Assam can be divided into three units-consolidated formation, semi-consolidated formationand unconsolidated formation. More than 75% of the State is underlain by unconsolidated formation comprising of clay, silt, sand, gravel, pebble and boulders.

Besides, high concentration of iron above the permissible limit of 1.0 mgA has been found in some parts of the state, namely Cachar, Darrang, Dhemaji, Dhubri, Goalpara, Golaghat, Hailakandi, Jorhat, Kamrup, Karbi Anglong. Karimganj, Kokrajhar, Lakhimpur, Morigaon, Nagaon, Nalbari, Sibsagar, Sonitpur as per data available with Central Ground Water Board, Assam.  
The annual rechargeable ground water resource is contributed by two major sources \-rainfall and other sources that include canal seepage return flow from irrigation, seepage from water bodies and artificial recharge due to water conservation structures. The overall contribution of rainfall to country's annual rechargeable ground water resource is nearly about 67% and the share of other sources taken together is nearly about 33%. Southwest monsoon being the most prevalent contributor of rainfall in thecountry, about 73% of country's Annual Rechargeable Ground Water Recharge takes place during the Kharif period of cultivation. In general, the irrigation sector remains the main consumer of ground water.(Source: DYNAMIC GROUND WATER RESOURCES OF INDIA, 2022 & C.G.W.B)  
3.1.3. Status of Water Availability  
For creating access to water source either assured or protective to each farmer will require a demand and supply assessment of crop water requirements, effective rainfall and potential source of existing and new water sources considering the geo-hydrological and agro-ecological scenario of the block. Emphasis is to be given for deriving the potential benefit through effective distribution and application mechanism, reducing the gap between potential created and utilized through more focus on command area development and precision irrigation. Proper integration of creation of diversion headwork and water harvesting structures, distribution system like canals and command area development works and precision farming is to be made for best possible use of water resources.  
Sources of water supply include: Major & Medium irrigation canals, Minor irrigation canals/tanks, Diversion channels, Rain water harvesting structures and Ground water extraction structures such as bore wells. The Status of Ground Water Availability for all the districts of Assam is shown below \-

The Irrigation Department is the nodal authority of the Government of Assam responsible for harnessing water resources by constructing Weirs/Headworks and networks of water carrier system/canal. The ultimate irrigation potential in Assam has been assessed as 27.00 lakh hectares by the Irrigation Department of the State. This potential is planned to be covered in a phased manner by harnessing the rich surface water and ground water resources of the State. Irrigation Department executes and maintains Major schemes (potential above 10,000 hectare), Medium schemes (potential from 2,000 hectare 10,000 hectares) and Minor surface water schemes (potential below 2,000 hectares). It is planned to provide irrigation facilities to 17 lakh hectares of cropped area through Minor Irrigation schemes and remaining 10 lakh hectares through Major and Medium Irrigation projects out of the ultimate irrigation potential. The area to be covered by Minor Irrigation schemes (17 lakh hectares) is further categorized as 10 lakh hectare from ground water resources and remaining 7 lakh hectares from surface water resources.

        3.3 Existing Type of Irrigation  
In Assam, a lot of work to be done in Irrigation sector although there are number of Major, Medium and Minor Irrigation Projects already taken up. There is a general misconception that since Assam is a heavy rainfall state, there is hardly any need for irrigation. Although the state usually receives good rainfall almost every year spreading over eight months (March to October), it is not evenly distributed over timeand space. Sometimes, monsoon is delayed or terminates early. The erratic nature of rainfall results in flood and drought, which adversely affects agricultural productivity. Also, there are certain specific areaswhich fall under rain-shadow belt. Agriculture in Assam, thus, seems to be a gamble in monsoon. Apartfrom these, the most discouraging aspect of irrigation development in the state is the decreasing trend of utilization of created potential from the irrigation schemes.

In surface irrigation category, canal based irrigation is a prominent source of irrigation in the state while in ground water category, the major source of irrigation is tube wells. Existing Irrigation Projects inAssam are shown in Table-3.3(a) & Table 3.3(b).

Water Requirement / Demand

The earlier Chapters dealt with the general profile, water profile and water availability in the State of Assam. This Chapter now deals with the current (2022) and projected (2027) demand for water from various sectors. The demand has been worked out on the basis of the data collected from different departments which has already been presented in previous Chapters. For practical considerations, the unit for volume of water has been chosen as Million Cubic Meters (MCM) instead of Billion Cubic Meters (BCM). MCM would denote the volume of water that would fill up an imaginary cube with edges one meter in length (about 1000 litres) and then multiplied a million times. With conversion, one MCM of water would also be equal to 100 hectare meters.

        4.1 Domestic Water Demand of the State  
This includes the water requirement by the households for the purposes such as drinking, cooking, bathing, lawn sprinkling, gardening, sanitary purposes, etc. The amount of domestic water consumption per person shall vary according to the living conditions. The total domestic water demand shall be equal to the total population multiplied by the desirable level of per capita domestic consumption. It has been assumed that per capita daily water requirement of people residing in urban areas of the State is 135 LPCD (litres per capita per day) and for population in rural areas, the daily per capita water requirement is 115 litres.

            4.1.1 Domestic Water Demand  
Table 4.1 indicates the district-wise projection of water demand in the year 2027 for which the actual decadal growth rate of each district in 2011 Census has been reckoned. In the hilly catchment of the upstream of Assam plains, natural springs and dug wells are generally the preferred means of fulfilling the needs of freshwater for the present population. In hilly areas most of the drinking water isharnessed from springs, streams, rivers, ponds and natural water bodies. In valleys, major portion of the domestic water is harnessed from ground water, predominantly through shallow tube wells and dug wells. Although there is abundant surface water in Assam, ground water continues to play a significant role in meeting the water demands of most communities in the State, especially those in the rural areas, with tube wells and dug wells as the most common means to access water.

        4.2 Crop Water Requirement  
Water requirement of a crop denotes the total quantity and the way in which crop requires water, from the time it is sown to the time it is harvested ("crop period"). Different crops will have different water requirements and the same crop may have different water requirements at different places of the same country depending upon the climate, type of soil, method of cultivation, rainfall, etc. The total quantity of water required by the crop for its full growth may be expressed in Hectare-m or in Million Cubic Meter or simply as a depth to which the total supplied irrigation water would stand above the surface without percolation or evaporation. Water is needed mainly to meet the demands of evaporation (E), transpiration (T) and metabolic needs of the plants, which is together known as consumptive use (CU). Since water used in the metabolic activities of plant is negligible, being only less than one percent of quantity of water passing through the plant, evaporation (E) and transpiration (T),  
i.e. ET is directly considered as equal to consumptive use (CU). In addition to ET, water requirement(WR) includes losses during the application of irrigation water to field (percolation, seepage and runoff) and water required for special operation such as land preparation, transplanting, leaching, etc.  
WR \= CU+ application losses \+ water needed for special operations  
Water requirement (WR) is, therefore, demand and the supply would consist of contribution from irrigation (IR), effective rainfall (ER) and soil profile contribution including that from shallow water tables (S)  
WR= IR+ ER \+ S  
Under field conditions, it is difficult to determine evaporation and transpiration separately. They areestimated together as evapo-transpiration (ET). It is, thus clear that  
Irrigation Water Need \= Crop water need \- Available rain fall.  
Water requirement of crop is the quantity of water regardless of source, needed for normal cropgrowth and yield in a period of time at a place and may be supplied by precipitation or irrigation or both. The crop water need always refers to a crop grown under optimal conditions, i.e. a uniform crop, actively growing, completely shading the ground, free of diseases, and favorable soil conditions (including fertility and water). The crop, thus, reaches its full production potential under the given environment. The crop water need mainly depends on:  
    \- The climate-in a sunny and hot climate, crops need more water per day than in a cloudy andcool climate;  
    \- The crop type-crops like maize or sugarcane need more water than crops like millet or sorghum;  
    \- The growth stage of the crop \-fully grown crops need more water than crops that have justbeen planted.

Broadly, the crops can be categorized into 3 groups \- crops whose water requirement is low, crops with mid level water requirement and crops where the water requirement is very high.  
    (a) Low Water Requirement Plants  
Plants that require low levels of water are often called drought-tolerant. Drought-tolerant plants can thrive in hot, dry conditions with very little water. They include both perennials and annuals. Most drought tolerant plants only have to be hand-watered when they are planted and while they are establishing themselves. After that, they can be left to the natural cycle of the elements.  
    (b) Mid-Level Water Requirement Crops  
Most plants land in this range when it comes to water requirements. These plants do not need to be watered every day, but they need to be watered when the soil has been dry for over a week or two. Sometimes these plants are classified as plants lying in the "occasional water zone". Rice, wheat, pulses and oilseeds are mainly covered under this category in Assam.  
    (c) High Water Requirement Plants  
Some plants require large amounts of water. The soil for these plants should always be kept moist. Standing water is not a concern for these plants, so you don't have to worry about root rot. Perennials are especially good for wet areas because they do not have to be replanted year after year, which can be difficult in marshy areas. Most annual flowering plants also do well in constantly moist soil. Somewater-thirsty crops are (litres/kg of crop) Cotton (7000-29000 litres), Rice (3000-5000 litres), Sugarcane (1500-3000), Soya (2000 litres), etc. The crop water requirement of the state is shown in Table 4.2 below.

            4.2.1 Technical Concepts  
An understanding of the following technical aspects would give a better perspective:  
                (a) "Base Period"  
It represents the whole period of cultivation from the time when irrigation water is first provided for ground preparation to the time when it is provided last just before the harvesting.

                (b) "Duty"  
"Duty' represents the irrigating capacity of a unit of water. Duty of a water simply expresses the number of hectares of land that can be irrigated for the full growth of the given crop by supplying 1 cumec water (cubic meter per second, as a unit of rate of flow of water) continuously during the entire "base period" of that crop. It is the relationship between the area of the crop irrigated and the quantity of the irrigation water required during the entire crop period.

                (c) "Delta"  
Delta is the total quantity of water required for any crop during its base period for its full-fledged nourishment when expressed in depth of water (.e. in 'cm' or in "inches'). The total quantity ofwater (volume of water) is divided by the total irrigated area to obtain Delta of crop of the irrigated area. Thus, Delta is the total depth of water required by a crop during the entire period when the said crop is in the field (denoted by symbol ?).  
                (d) "Consumptive Water Requirement"  
Consumptive water requirement is the amount of water potentially required to meet the evapo- transpiration needs of the plant so that the plant does not suffer in its growth through short supply of water. It is, thus, the depth of water needed to meet the water loss through evapo- transpiration of a disease-free crop, growing in large fields under non-restricting soil conditions including soil water and fertility and achieving full production under the given growing environment.  
                (e) "Net Irrigation Requirement"  
Net irrigation requirement is the depth of irrigation water, exclusive of precipitation, stored moisture, or groundwater that is required consumptively for crop production as also for other purposes such as leaching, etc.

                (f) "Effective Rainfall"  
Effective rainfall is the precipitation falling during the growing period of the crop that is available to meet the evapo-transpiration requirement of crops. It does not include precipitation lost through deep percolation below the root zone or through surface runoff.  
                (g) "Irrigation Efficiency"  
Irrigation efficiency is the percentage of applied irrigation water stored in the soil and available for Consumptive use by the crop.

                (h) "Irrigation Water Requirement"  
The net irrigation water requirement divided by the irrigation efficiency is termed as irrigation water requirement.

        4.3 Crop Water Demand in Assam  
As is known, cereals are cultivated on major part of the gross cropped area in the State and,hence, the crop water requirement for major cereals like Paddy, Maize, Wheat, Rabi Pulses, etc. as estimated by State Agricultural University has been taken. The district wise crop water demand as also the total water potential to be created is shown in Table \- 4.3.

        4.4 Livestock Water Requirement  
The water demand for the livestock of the State is determined by multiplying the total livestock population with the per capita water requirement (litres/day/Number) for each category of the population. With the existing estimated population, the total projected livestock population in 2027 has been worked out based on the average growth rate. Once that has been estimated, the district-wise livestock water demand for the State has been assessed in Table 4.4(a) and Table 4.4(b). It has been assumed that the existing water potential is equal to present water demand of livestock. Thus, the water potential to be created implies the quantum of water availability to be created to meet the water demand by the livestock in 2027\.

        4.5 Industrial Water Demand  
Assam is not an industrially developed State and its position in industrial scenario of the country is not very prominent. As per the Statistical Handbook, Assam 2022, there are 5196 factories in Assam and the number of registered MSME units are 94287\. These industries primarily relate to tea,coal, fertilizer, jute, petroleum, wheat flour, cement, small food processing units, furniture making units, etc.  
Based on the available information collected during the preparation of DIPs in each of the 32Districts in Assam, the total requirement of water by the industries has been assessed. Out of the 32Districts only 11 districts has the demand of water for industrial purpose which are shown below in Table 4.5.  
Total industrial demand of water for the state is 321.079262 MCM.

        4.6 Water Demand for Power Generation  
The State has no N-power plants that otherwise are known to be requiring a huge quantity of water per MW of power generation. As per the data available with the Assam Power Generation Corporation Ltd., there are two running hydro-power projects \-Karbi Langpi Hydro Electric Project (comprising two Units with an installed capacity of 100 MW) in Karbi Anglong District and Myntriang Small Hydro Electric Project (comprising two Units with a plant capacity of 3 MW). There are some running Thermal Power Stations (TPS) in the State where the water requirement is huge. They are- Lakwa TPS in Sivasagar District (120 MW), Namrup TPS in Dibrugarh District (133 MW), Chandrapur TPS (Revival; 60 MW) in Kamrup Rural District and Bongaigaon TPS in Kokrajhar District (240 MW).Thus, the running 4 TPS have a combined installed capacity of 553 MW of power. Besides, there arealso some upcoming TPS such as 2 more Units (250x2 MW) of Bongaigaon TPS and Margherita Thermal Power Project (660 MW) in Tinsukia District. Thus, the combined installed capacity the 2 additions as above that are likely to be ready within the next 3-4 years would have 1160 MW of power. The overall installed capacity would thus be 1713 MW by the year 2020 or so. Water is one of the key input requirements for thermal power generation as it is required for process cooling in the condenser, ash disposal, removal of heat generated in plant auxiliaries and various other plant consumptive uses. The raw water is generally drawn from fresh water source such as river, lake, canal, reservoir, barrage, etc. Treated sewage water may also be used as source of raw water for the power plants located adjacent to the cities. Plant water consumption is governed by a number of factors such as quality ofraw water, type of condenser cooling system, quality of coal, ash utilization, type of ash disposal system, waste water management aspects, etc. At the current level of plant technology and efficiency levels of resource usage in power plants, the average consumptive water requirement for coal-based plants with cooling towers is assumed to be 4 m3/h per MW (96 m3/day per MW). Assuming that a power plant effectively runs for 325 days in a year, the annual requirement of water for generating 1 MW of power in a typical thermal power plant would be 31200 m3 (0.031 MCM). Based on the abovenorm, the existing consumptive water requirement in Assam for the TPS is 17.14 MCM.

        4.8 Water Budget  
Water budget reflects the relationship between input and output of water through a region. Thus, it shows the gap between water availability and requirement. The negative gap indicates that there are sufficient water resources for irrigation, domestic and the industrial uses. The District-wise position is given in Table-4.8. lt is seen from this Table that Assam has adequate availability of water to fulfill the demand by creating efficient technologies of irrigation through various schemes.

Strategic Action Plan

In due cognizance of the criticality of irrigated agriculture in ensuring adequate production, which results both in food security and economic growth, the Irrigation department is playing a vital role in the development of irrigation potential of Assam by harnessing the rich surface and ground water resources of the State. Its mainobjectives / roles include increasing agricultural production of the State by providing assured irrigation supply to the field in close coordination with Agriculture Department to assure food security, providing assured irrigation during all seasons to the cultivators, creation of irrigation potential through irrigation schemes, utilizing the created irrigation potential by equitable distribution of water through command area development and water management, creation of additional potential through Major, Medium and Minor Irrigation schemes, etc.  
Accordingly, the State's Strategic Action Plan would logically base itself in the similar action plans prepared for each of the 32 districts as a part of the respective approved District Irrigation Plans (DIPs). The strategic action plan for the State thus reflects an effective aggregation of various schemes proposed in eachDistrict and its blocks based on the ground need of the concerned areas and villages.  
The State's strategic action plan has been formulated for a period of five years with focus on coveringthe un- irrigated areas. Due emphasis is given on better and more effective use of the available water resources of the State for better irrigation efficiency.

5.1. Command Area Development Plan  
The primary goal of the Command Area Development Plan (CADP) is to augment the efficiencyof irrigation systems which is achieved by reducing water wastage and ensuring a more uniform distribution of water across the command area. Command area development aims in bridging the gap between potential created and their utilization. By ensuring optimal irrigation, the CADP aims to significantly enhance agricultural productivity. This increase in yield can drastically improve the economic prospects of farming communities. The ultimate goal of the CADP is to foster socio-economic development by improving farm productivity and income. The CADP seeks to uplift farming communities and contribute to overall national economic growth. Therefore, systematic development of commands of irrigation projects should be taken up in order to fully utilize the irrigation potential created.  
The districts where Command Area Development Plan is taken by taking up new schemes are Charaideo, Hailakandi, Kamrup, Lakhimpur, Majuli, Nagaon & Sonitpur. The details of the Command Area Development Plan for the above districts are tabulated below.

                \- Community Empowerment: Empowering local communities creates a cooperative environment where knowledge and resources are shared, enhancing the collective capability to manage water resources effectively.

            6.1.2. Implementation Strategies:  
                \- Establishing and Strengthening WUAs: Robust Water Users Associations are crucial for effective PIM. These should be legally recognized and empowered to manage water distribution and irrigation maintenance decisively.

                \- Capacity Building and Training: Conducting regular training programs for WUAs and local farmers on modern irrigation technologies, efficient water management practices, maintenance of infrastructure, and climate resilience strategies. These sessions could include practical demonstrations and workshops led by experts in the field.  
                \- Regular Monitoring and Feedback Mechanisms: Implementing systems for continuous monitoring of irrigation practices and infrastructure condition. Establishing a structured process for collecting and utilizing feedback from WUAs to ensure that management strategies remain aligned with local needs and conditions.  
                \- Financial and Technical Support: Providing WUAs with necessary financial resources and technical assistance. This support could encompass grants for infrastructure improvements, subsidies for technology upgrades, and access to consultants for technical guidance.

        6.2. Integration of Water Use Efficient systems  
The irrigation sector in Assam is at a crucial juncture, faced with the dual challenges of enhancing productivity and managing resources sustainably in the face of changing climate conditions. The integration of Water Use Efficient systems (WUEs) such as drip irrigation, sprinklers, and rain guns with high-yielding seeds \&selecting less water consumptive crops presents a transformative opportunity for the region. These systems notonly aim to optimize water usage-critical in areas experiencing water scarcity-but also enhance irrigation efficiency through precision techniques.  
By implementing technologies that use water more efficiently, the region can reduce its dependence onunpredictable monsoon rains and groundwater sources, which are often overexploited. This shift not only supports sustainable irrigation practices but also contributes to the overall water management strategy of the state, preserving vital resources for future generations.  
Drip Irrigation:  
Incorporating drip irrigation into Assam's State Irrigation Plan (SIP) aligns with the strategic initiatives to enhance water conservation and improve irrigation productivity across the state. Drip irrigation, recognized for itsprecise delivery of water directly to the plant roots, offers a sustainable solution to the challenges posed by erratic weather patterns and varying water availability in Assam. Drip irrigation significantly enhances water efficiency by minimizing losses due to evaporation and runoff, a crucial benefit for Assam given its susceptibility to both floods and droughts.  
Implementing drip irrigation across Assam involves overcoming several challenges, particularly the initialfinancial outlay, technical expertise, training to farmers and the maintenance and protection of the complex system from damage caused by agricultural activities and local wildlife.  
Sprinkler Irrigation:  
Sprinkler irrigation, known for its versatility and efficiency is an effective tool for addressing Assam's varied irrigation challenges. The sprinkler irrigation system is designed to suit the diverse irrigation landscape of Assam by utilizing local water resources and uniformly distributing the water across the fields thereby reducing soil erosion.Sprinklers can also help moderate microclimates within the irrigation environment, vital during Assam's intense heat spells, by aiding in temperature control through evapotranspiration.

The introduction of sprinkler systems across Assam's irrigation landscape entails overcoming certain challenges like providing Comprehensive training programs to local farmers and irrigation technicians to operateand maintain these advanced systems and Infrastructure Vulnerability.  
Rain Gun Irrigation:  
Rain gun irrigation, a high-pressure irrigation system that sprays water over large areas in a manner similar to rainfall, is renowned for its ability to cover large areas quickly and with substantial volumes of water. The dynamic spray action of rain guns facilitates deeper water penetration, which is beneficial for root development and reduces surface runoff, particularly in areas prone to soil erosion. It offers a practical solution particularly suited to Assam's diverse agricultural demands, including large- scale operations like tea plantations and expansive crop fields.  
However, Implementing rain gun irrigation systems across Assam involves addressing certain challenges, particularly related to costs and technical expertise.  
            6.2.1. Future Prospects in SIP  
Looking forward, the SIP plans to integrate advanced technological solutions such as IoT-enabled sensors for real-time soil and weather monitoring, & use of spatial technologies for detailed irrigation planning in collaboration with ASSAC/NESSAC. This will enhance the irrigation systems' responsiveness to changing environmental & climatic conditions.  
The integration of advanced sensor technologies and automated systems into the sprinkler irrigationframework will enable real-time adjustments based on immediate weather changes and soil moisture levels.  
The SIP also plans to integrate rain gun systems with advanced technological solutions such as real-time weather monitoring and automated adjustment capabilities to respond to changing environmental conditions, such as shifts in rainfall patterns or soil moisture levels.  
In future the State Irrigation Plan would be prepared in alignment with the comprehensive State Water Policy. The above initiatives will support the state's goals for sustainable water usage and economic growth.  
            6.2.2. Current Adoption Levels and Targets for Future Implementation of Water Use Efficient systems in Assam

Conclusion

The State Irrigation Plan (SIP) for Assam, prepared for the 2022-27 period, represents a comprehensive approach to enhancing the irrigation infrastructure across the state's 32 districts.  
For the current period, the District Irrigation Plans (DIPs), which have been approved by theDistrict Level Sanctioning Committee chaired by respective District Commissioners, propose a substantial increase in financial commitment-totaling Rs. 36,406 crore. This investment is targeted to enhance the irrigated area significantly, projecting a rise from 8.27 Lakh Hectares to 12.37 Lakh hectares (AIA) by the end of 2027\. The ambition extends further to elevate the overall irrigation potential to 20.64 Lakh hectares (AIA) post-2027.  
This strategic outline incorporates inputs from various sources, including the IrrigationDepartment of Assam, Central Ground Water Board, and other relevant state and national data repositories. The SIP 2022-2027 also emphasizes the integration of climate-resilient measures. Various innovative irrigation systems, including drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, and rain gun systems havebeen proposed as key tools for improving irrigation efficiency by reducing water wastage and improving the crop yield.  
The SIP also builds upon the success of past innovations like Solar-Powered Mobile Lift Irrigation Systems, Cart-Mounted Solar Operated Pumping Systems, and Electrically Operated Lift Irrigation Systems with Pontoon, which have proven effective in many districts. These systems havecontributed significantly to improving irrigation efficiency, particularly in power-scarce areas and districts with challenging terrain.  
Moreover, a set of new low-cost innovations, such as Solar Operated Raingun Sprinkler Systems, Integrated Solar Powered Irrigation Systems, and check dams, have been planned for 2024-25 across multiple districts to ensure sustainable water management, enhance groundwater recharge, and provide reliable irrigation solutions.  
The SIP emphasizes inter-departmental collaboration, drawing on the expertise and resources of various departments like Agriculture, Fisheries, and Rural Development to ensure a holistic approach to water management thereby contributing effectively to overall economic development and environmental sustainability.  
Through these measures, Irrigation Department is prepared to meet future demands therebyimproving the livelihoods of its farming communities. By enhancing irrigation potential, integrating advanced technologies, and fostering community participation, the SIP lays the groundwork for a resilient irrigation infrastructure capable of thriving in the face of climatic uncertainties and evolving water demands thus safeguarding its agricultural productivity for future generations.
