20 AMRIT SAROVAR   
2023 December

**A perspective on implementation experience**

**Executive Summary**

Introduction

Water is one of the most important natural resources. It is an invaluable gift from nature to the entire human race. Two-third of the earth is covered with water, but only two to three percent of available water is usable. Today, many countries of the world, including India, are facing acute water crisis. Realizing the same problem, our Hon’ble Prime Minister called for the construction of 75 Amrit Sarovars (ponds) in each district of the country through the launch of Mission Amrit Sarovar on the 24th April 2022\. The Construction of Amrit Sarovar was a symbolic gesture of constructive actions, dedicated to India on the occasion of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, marking 75 years of independence from colonial rule.

The objective of Mission Amrit Sarovar was aimed to “construct/develop at least 75 Amrit Sarovar (ponds) in every district of the country” with a pondage area of minimum of 1 acre (0.4 hectare) and a water holding capacity of about 10,000 cubic meters thus playing an important role in increasing the availability of water, both on surface as well as underground especially focusing on the water stressed blocks of the district.

The Mission was run with a “Whole of Government approach” in all its aspects, accordingly various Ministries/Departments and organizations have participated namely, Dept. of Rural Development (the Nodal Ministry), Dept of Land Resources, Dept. of Water Resources, Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Ministry of Road Transport & Highway, Ministry of Railways, and Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geo-informatics (BISAG-N). Technology has been utilized at every stage of the Mission from site selection to progress monitoring and completion.

The Mission was executed through the States and Districts with the help of ongoing schemes namely, Mahatma Gandhi NREGS, 15th Finance Commission Grants, PMKSY sub schemes such as Watershed Development Component, Har Khet ko Pani, States’ own scheme, and CSR funds. It mainly encouraged mobilization of citizens and non-government resources for supplementing the efforts. Various ministries like the Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways and other public agencies engaged for infrastructure project development were also engaged in the Mission for the purpose of using the soil/silt excavated out of the Amrit Sarovar. Jan Bhagidari’ has been the core of this Mission and involves people’s participation at all levels. About, 65,050 user groups were formed dedicated to each Amrit Sarovar. These user groups have been fully involved during the entire process of development of Amrit Sarovar including feasibility assessment, commencement and completion of the works, and its sustainability.

Against the total target of 50,000, the mission has constructed/rejuvenated more than 68000 Amrit Sarovar with having total water holding capacity of 68,000 crore cubic meters. Additional to the accomplishment of the Mission target, linking Amrit Sarovar with Panchayat Pratinidhis, Panchayat level officers, User groups were the imperative aspects. About, 77,596 Panchayat Pratinidhi, 91,722 Panchayat Level Officers were engaged in the Mission.

On the occasion of Independence Day and Republic Day (i.e., on 15th August and 26th January respectively), Tricolor was hoisted at Amrit Sarovar worksite, by the freedom fighter or his/her family member or by the family member of martyr or a local Padma Awardee. In case there is no such citizen available, the eldest citizen of the specific/local gram Panchayat to be engaged. About, 2,203 freedom fighters, 22,993 eldest members of the panchayat, 385 family members of freedom fighters, 742 family members of martyrs and 69 Padma Awardees participated in the Mission.

Each completed Amrit Sarovar is to have a common signage board stating all the details of the site including the scheme under which it was constructed and mandatory plantation of trees such as Neem, Bargadh, Peepal and any other native trees. About 23,51,331 trees were planted through the Mission out of which 5,32,124 were Neem, 3,65,791 were Peepal, 3,24,945 were Bargadh and 11,28,471 were other native trees.

To bring transparency and effective monitoring, a dedicated Mission Amrit Sarovar Portal has created accessible through the link https://amritsarovar.gov.in/login

During the mission, availability of public land for at least 75 Amrit Sarovar and a size of 1 acre in each District in the smaller state (such as Kerala) and north-eastern Himalayan States was a challenge. This has been addressed by relaxing the provision of exact number of 75 Amrit Sarovar in each District as well as minimum area of 1 acre.

The sarovar is situated near the village Shiva Temple, with area of 0.449 ha. collected the

waste from 80% of households. Without any proper treatment the waste water created unhygienic conditions, silt deposit in the bed restricted the seepage of water underground and caused overflowing in rainy season. To preserve the religious sentiments, maintain hygienic conditions, cleanliness in surrounding, this pond was selected on priority basis, to be developed as “Amrit Sarovar”. The project, started with dewatering of pond with the help of villagers, the excavation of silt deposited at bed and excavating a little further for fresh soil, and using the excavated silt and soil for fixing the side berms of the pond, as well as to maintain a naturally stable slope, giving opportunity to a local ecosystem for growth. For treatment of waste water entering into pond, the entry was constrained to single point and waste water is treated naturally by passing through, Seenchewal well method and constructed wetland to improve the overall health of water. The pathway was also constructed on the berms for light walking, and a park was developed nearby for kids to play. The treated water is disposed through a drain which allow the use of water for irrigation. The project improved the overall health and appearance of the surrounding area. Regular movement of water limited the growth of insects near pond, the slopes of pond provide a breeding ground for amphibians creating a healthy ecosystem for animals and birds as well as nearby habitants. The nearby park, playground for kids, tot lot and open-air gym provided a relief. The biggest relief to villagers is from the overflowing dirty water into temple complex, streets and houses nearby. The treated water through drain is delivered to the nearby fields thereby reducing the need for underground water extraction and the phosphates and nitrates present in water also balance the use of fertilizers.

**Sarovar ID :** 36123  
Somalapura village, surrounded by

hills, faced the challenge of limited water resources. The existing lake, although designed to collect rainwater for cattle irrigation, had its limitations.

During summer, the accumulated water was drained, leaving the cattle without a sufficient water source. Recognizing this critical issue, the Gram Panchayathas implemented Amirt Sarovar under MGNREGS for sustainable water availability throughout the year. One of the primary steps undertaken in the restoration process was the removal of accumulated silt from the lakebed under MGNREGS, an impressive 10.45 lakh liters of rainwater were extracted from the silt-laden lakebed. This substantial increase in water storage capacity laid the foundation for the future sustainability of Amrit Sarovar.To fortify the lake embankments, stone pitching was meticulously implemented, preventing erosion and ensuring the structural integrity of the lake.

The purpose of constructing a waste weir was to facilitate the drainage of excess water flowing into the lake. However, due to the damage it incurred, a significant amount of water was being lost instead of being stored in the lake. Thankfully, the waste weir has now been repaired, allowing the water to accumulate in the lake up to the level of the waste weir. This repair has restored the lake's capacity to store water effectively, while also enabling any overflowing water to exit the lake conveniently.

When it comes to dry mountains of high Himalayas where main source of water is depends on glacier water which is a natural cycle as the winter snow deposits in the high mountain becoming glacier and melts sufficient water during the summer season to irrigate and other purposes.

Unfortunately the global climate change affects the natural ecosystem by receding the size of glacier as well as less snowfall in winter witnessing the scarcity of water in Ladakh. Therefore Rural Development Department Leh has taken an initiative towards the conservation of water at Halqa Panchayat Saboo under SDP, 14th FC in convergence with MGNREGA. This project is one of the example in the history of ladakh which can store around 19,70,000 gallon of water, which will help the farmers to irrigate their fertile lands, as saboo village is well known to produce vegetables. Before the construction of the Amrit Sarovar, the community faced water scarcity, limited agricultural activities, and economic challenges. After completion, a reliable water supply led to increased crop yields, expanded farming opportunities, improved livelihoods, and enhanced economic growth. The Amrit Sarovar brought stability, resilience, and prosperity to the community, transforming their quality of life. The availability of a reliable water source from the storage tank has significantly enhanced plantation activities. With ample water supply, farmers and community members have been able to establish and expand tree plantations. The increased availability of water has supported the growth and survival of young saplings, leading to healthier and more productive trees. This, in turn, has boosted the overall timber and wood production within the community.

In a small village named Shara, located in Kharu Block, a transformative project under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA brought about a remarkable change in the lives of its inhabitants. The construction of Amrit sarovar not only resolved the long- standing water scarcity issue but also

empowered the community and set an example for sustainable development.

The impact of the water reservoir was immediate and far-reaching. The villagers no longer had to travel long distances in search of water or rely on unpredictable rainfall.The Amrit Sarovar brought about a monumental change in Shara village. The availability of a reliable water source throughout the year not only transformed the lives of the villagers but also unlocked numerous socio-economic opportunities. The villagers could now engage in agriculture more effectively.

Before the construction of the Amrit Sarovar, the community faced water scarcity, limited agricultural activities, and economic challenges. After the Sarovar's completion, a reliable water supply led to increased crop yields, expanded farming opportunities, improved livelihoods, and enhanced economic growth. The Amrit Sarovar brought stability, resilience, and prosperity to the community, transforming their quality of life. The availability of a reliable water source from the Amrit Sarovar has significantly enhanced plantation activities. With ample water supply, farmers and community members have been able to establish and expand tree plantations. The increased availability of water has supported the growth and survival of young saplings, leading to healthier and more productive trees. This, in turn, has boosted the overall timber and wood production within the community.
