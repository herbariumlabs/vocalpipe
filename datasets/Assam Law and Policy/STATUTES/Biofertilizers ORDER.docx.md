      2. Medium

   Use a plating medium of the following composition:

| Agar | 20 g |
| :---- | ----- |
| *Yeast Extract* | 1 g |
| Mannitol | 10 g |
| Potassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4) | 0.5g |
| Magnesium sulphate (MgSO4 7H2O) | 0.2g |
| Sodium Chloride (NaCl) | 0.1g |
| Congo red | 2.5 ml |
| Distilled water | 1000 ml |
| pH | 7.0 |

      3. Sterilizing and preparation procedure for plates:

         1. Sterilize the sampling and plating equipment with dry heat in a hot air oven at not less than 160o C for not less than 2 hours.

      2. Sterilize the media by autoclaving at 120o C for 20 min. To permit passage of steam into and from closed container when autoclaved, keep stoppers slightly loosened or plugged with cotton. Air from with in the chamber of the sterilizer should be ejected allowing steam pressure to rise.

   ## **Preparation of Plating Medium and Pouring**

      3. Prepare growth medium in accordance with the composition of the specific Biofertilizers.

      4. Melt the required amount of medium in boiling water or by exposure to flowing steam in partially closed container but avoid prolonged exposure to unnecessarily high temperature during and after melting. Melt enough medium which will be used with in 3h. Re-sterlization of the medium may cause partial precipitation of ingredients.

      5. When holding time is less than 30 min promptly cool the molten medium to about 45oC, and store until used, in a water bath or incubator at 43oC to 45oC. Introduce 12 to15 ml of liquefied medium or appropriate quantity depending on size of the Petri dish at 42 to 44o C into each plate. Gently lift the cover of the dish just enough to pour in the medium. Sterlize the lips of the medium container by exposure to flame.

         1. Immediately before pouring.

         2. Periodically during pouring, and

         3. When pouring is completed for each batch of plates, if portion of molten medium remain in containers and are to be used without subsequent sterilization for pouring additional plates. As each plate is poured thoroughly mix the medium with test portions in the Petri dish.

      6. By rotating and tilting the dish and without splashing the medium over edge, spread the medium evenly over the bottom of the plate. Provide conditions so that the medium solidifies with reasonable promptness (5-10min) before removing the plates from surface.

3. ## **Preparation of serial dilution for plate count**

   1. Dispense 30 g of Inoculants to 270 ml of sterile distilled/ demineralized water and shake for 10 min on a reciprocal shaker or homogenizer. Make serial dilutions up to 10\-9 by suspending 10 ml aliquot of previous dilution to 90ml of water. Take 0.1 ml or suitable alliquotes of 10\-5 to 10\-9 dilutions using sterile pipettes and deliver to Petri dishes containing set medium as given in

   2.1 and spread it uniformly with a spreader. Invert the plates and promptly place them in the incubator.

4. ## **Incubation of plates**

   1. Label the plates and incubate at 28±2o C for 3 to 5 days for fast growing Rhizobia and 5 to 10 days for slow- growing ones.  
   2. Colony counting aids

   Count the colonies with the aid of magnifying lens under uniform and properly controlled, artificial illumination. Use a colony counter, equipped with a guide plate and rules in Centimeter Square. Record the total number of colonies with the hand tally. Avoid mistaking particles of undissolved medium or precipitated matter, in plates for pinpoint colonies. To distinguish colonies from dirt, specks and other foreign matter, examine doubtful objects carefully.

   3. Count all plates but consider for the purpose of calculation plates showing more than 30 and less than 300 colonies per plate. Disregard colonies, which absorb Congo red and stand out as reddish colonies. Rhizobium stands out as white, translucent, glistening and elevated colonies. Count such colony numbers and calculate figures in terms of per gram, of carrier. Also check for freedom from contamination at 10\-5 dilution.

5. ## **Test for nodulation**

|  | Prepare the solution no. (f) As 100 ml of stock solution and add final nutrient solution at the rate of 0.5 ml per liter. |  |  |  |  |

2. ## **Preparation**

   Prepare the nutrient solution by weighing out substances (a), (b) and (d) and dissolving them in a liter of water. To this solution add 0.5 ml of trace elements solution and 0.5 ml of iron solution. Grind in a mortar 0.344 g of calcium sulphate (c) to a fine consistency and add to the final nutrient solution. Auto clave the nutrient solution thus prepared, at 120oC for 20 min.

   ## **Notes**

1. The nutrient solution may be prepared in the tap water provided the water is soft.

2. The nutrient solution should be shaken well to disperse calcium sulphate before dispensing.

3. If the solution is made up with distilled water, the pH is about 7.2 before autoclaving and falls to 5.5 on autoclaving and rises slowly on standing to about 5.8. However, there is no need to adjust pH. For most tropical legumes; pH of about 6.0 is adequate.

   3. ## **Procedure**

      1. 	Immerse the seeds in 95 percent alcohol and follow by surface sterilization in freshly prepared chlorine water (for 15 to 20 min) or 0.1 percent mercuric chloride solution 3 min in a suitable container such as a screw –capped bottle or a test tube with a rubber hung. In case of seeds

   with tough seed coat, concentrated sulphuric acid may be used as a surface Sterilants for 20 to 30 min. It is recommended that the seeds should be placed overnight in a desiccators containing calcium chloride before surface sterilization with sulphuric acid. Pour out the Sterilants and wash the seeds in several changes of sterile water and wash the seeds in several changes of sterile water (at least ten times) to get rid of the Sterilants. Fill earthenware or glazed pot with soil (2 parts soil and 1 part washed coarse sand) (pH 6 to 7\) and autoclave for 2 h at 120o C. After two days incubation at room temperature, repeat autoclaving to ensure complete sterility of soil. Inoculate surface sterilized seeds with water slurry of the inoculant taken from a culture packet (15 to 100 g seeds per gram of inoculants depending on the size of the seed) and sow the seeds. Keep a set of pots with Uninoculated seeds as control and also a set of pots with ammonium nitrate at the rate of 100 kg N/ha as control aid incubate them in a pot-culture house during appropriate seasons for appropriate plants, taking care to separate the inoculated pots from the control pots. If growth rooms or cabinets having facilities to adjust temperature and light are available, the pots may be incubated in such controlled environmental conditions. Sterilize the nutrient solution at 120o C for 20 min and irrigate each pot once to the moisture holding capacity of soil. Subsequently, water the seedling periodically with sterilized water preferably through a plastic tube, taking care to prevent splashing of water from inoculated pots to uninoculated ones. Maintain required number of replicated pots (4 to 6\) for each botanical species for statistical analysis.

      2. After two to three weeks of growth, thin down the number of plants in each

   pot to four uniform plants. At the end of 6 to 8 weeks, take one set of pots from both the control and inoculated series and, separate the plants carefully from the soil under slow running water. Obtain data on the number, colour (effective nodules are pink or red) and mass of nodules. At the end of 6 to 8 weeks, harvest the shoot system, dry at 60o C for 48 h and determine dry mass. For the above purpose, maintain adequate replications of pots (4 to 16).

      3. Record the nodulation data regarding formation of pink colour of nodules as revealed visually when nodules are cut open by razor blade. After computing the data, based on the dry mass of plants and nodulation data decide the effectiveness of culture. If good effective pink nodulation is obtained in inoculated plants together with local absence or sometimes presence of stray nodules in controls and if there is a 50 percent increase in the dry mass of plants over the Uninoculated control without nitrate, it may be concluded that the culture is of the require quality.

Wash the dried culture and take it as a sample. The contents of the flasks in inoculated control series should be similar manner.

   3. Determination by Kjeldahl Method

1) Reagents

2) Sulphuric acid-93-98 percent, N-free

3) Digestion mixture- Mix copper sulphate and potassium sulphate in the ratio 1: 10 and grind them to a fine powder.  
4) Sodium hydroxide pellets or solution, N-free- For solution, dissolve about 450 g of sodium hydroxide in water, cool, and dilute 1 liter (sp gr of the solution should be at least 1.36)  
5) Zinc granules-reagent grade.

6) Indicators: \-

   1) Methyl red indicator \- Dissolve 1g of methyl red in 200ml of Ethanol.

   2) Mixed indicator \- Prepare mixed indicator by Dissolving 0.8 of methyl red and 0.2 g of methyl blue in 500 ml of ethanol.

6) Hydrochloric or sulphuric acid – Standard solution 0.5 or 0.1 N when amount of nitrogen is small.

7) Sodium hydroxide standard solution – 0.1 N (or other specified concentration)

   Note- Ratio of salt to acid (m/v) should be about 1:1 at the end of the digestion for proper temperature control. Digestion may be incomplete at a lower ratio, and nitrogen may be lost at higher ratio. Each gram of fat consumes 10 ml of sulphuric acid and each gram of carbohydrate 4.0 ml of sulphuric acid during digestion.

## **5.4. Apparatus**

1) For digestion	\- Use kjeldahl’s flasks of hard, moderately thick, well annealed glass with total capacity approximately 500 to 800 ml. Conduct digestion over heating device adjust to bring 250 ml of water at 25o C to rolling boil in about 5 minutes. To test the heaters, preheat for 10 minutes in the case of gas burners and for 30 minutes in the case of electric heaters. Add 3 to 4 boiling chips to prevent superheating.

2) For distillation \- Use 500 to 800ml kjeldahl’s flask fitted with rubber stopper through which passes the lower end of an efficient scrubber bulb or trap to prevent mechanical carry-over of sodium hydroxide during distillation. Connect the upper end of the bulb tube to a condenser by rubber tubing. Trap the out let of the condenser in such a way as to ensure absorption of ammonia distilled over with the receiver.

## **Procedure: \-**

1) Place 0.25 g of the sample in the digestion flask. Add 0.7 gm mercuric oxide, 15 gm potassium sulphate followed by 25 ml of sulphuric acid. Shake, let stand for about 30 minutes and heat carefully until frothing ceases. Boil briskly until the solution clears and continue boiling further for 90 minutes.

   Cool, add about 200 ml of water cool to room temperature and add a few zinc granules.

   2) Tilt the flask and carefully add 50 ml of sodium hydroxide solution without agitation. Immediately connect the flask to the distillation bulb on the condenser whose tip is immersed in 50 ml of standard 0.1 N acid in the receiving flasks. Rotate the digestion flask carefully to mix the content. Heat until 150 ml of the distillate collects and titrate excess acid with 0.1 N base using methyl-red or mixed indicator. Carry out blank determination on reagents.

   Note: Check the ammonia recording periodically, using inorganic nitrogen control, for example, ammonium sulphate.

4) Calculation: \-

   1) Nitrogen content, percent by mass \=

      (Milliliters of 0.1 N acid for sample – milliliters of 0.1 N acids for blank) X0.14 Mass of sample taken

   2) Total nitrogen in culture \= Total dry mass of sample X percent nitrogen.

   (a) Take a 1.0 g of accurately weighed sample each from the inoculated series and from the controls. Put them separately in 250 ml volumetric flask, add 150 ml water, mix the content and make up the volume to 250 ml water. Shake for 5 minutes and centrifuge for 15 minutes at 10000 rpm. Estimate glucose in the supernatant in triplicate. The difference between the two provides the data of actual amount of glucose consumed. Calculate the amount of nitrogen fixed per gram of sucrose consumed.

   5. **Determination of Glucose**: \- From the supernatant, draw suitable aliquots and estimate reducing sugars (glucose) as follows.  
      1) Reagents.

      2) Soxhelt modification of Fehling solution: \- Prepare by mixing equal volumes of solution A and solution B immediately before using.

      3) Copper sulphate solution (Solution A)- Dissolve 34.639 g of copper sulphate crystals (CuSO4 5H2O) in water, dilute to 500ml and filter through glass wool or filter paper.

      **Standardization of copper sulphate solution**: \- Using separate pipettes, pipette accurately 5 ml of solution A and 5 ml of solution B into a conical flask of 250 ml capacity. Heat this mixture to boiling on asbestos gauze and add standard invert sugar solution from a burette, about 1 ml less than the expected volume, which will reduce the Fehling solution completely (about 48 ml). Add 1 ml of methylene blue indicator while keeping the solution boiling. Complete the titration within 3 min, the end point being indicated by change of colour from blue to red. From the volume of invert sugar solution used, calculate the strength(s) of the copper sulphate solution by multiplying the titre value by 0.001 (mg/ml of the standard invert sugar solution). This would give the quantity of invert sugar required to reduce the copper in 5 ml of copper sulphate solution.

      4) Potassium sodium tartrate (Rochelle salt) solution (solution B): \- Dissolve 173 g of potassium sodium tartrate and 50 g of sodium hydroxide in water, and dilute to 500 ml. Let the solution stand for a day, and filter.

      5) Hydrochloric acid – sp gr 1.18 at 20o C (approximately 12 N)

      6) Standard invert sugar solution –Weigh accurately 0.95 g of sucrose and dissolve it in 500 ml of water. Add 32 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, boil gently for 30 min and keep aside for 24 hours. Neutralize with sodium carbonate and make the final volume to 1000ml; 50 ml of this solution contains 0.05 g of invert sugar.

      7) Methylene blue indicator-  0.2 percent in water.

      8) Procedure: \- Place about 1 g(M), accurately weighed, of the prepared sample of AI into a 250ml volumetric flask and dilute with about 150 ml of water. Mix thoroughly the contents of the flask and make the volume of 250 ml with water. Using separate pipettes, take accurately 5 ml each of solution A and solution B in a porcelain dish. Add about

      12 ml of AI solution from a burette and heat to boiling over an asbestos gauze. Add 1 ml of methylene blue indicator and while keeping the solution boiling complete the titration within 3 minutes, the end point being indicated by change of colour from blue to red. Note the volume (H) in ml of AI solution required for the titration.

      9) ## **Calculation**

      Total reducing sugars, percent by mass \= 250 x 100xS

H x M

Where

S \= strength of copper sulphate solution,

H \= volume in ml of AI solution required for titration, and M \= mass in g of AI taken for the test.

6. ## **Determination of sucrose**

   1) Procedure: \- To 100 ml of the stock AI solution, add 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heat the solution to near boiling. Keep aside overnight. Neutralize this solution with sodium carbonate and determine the total reducing sugars as described in.  
      2) Calculation

         1) Sucrose, percent by mass \= (reducing sugars after inversion, percent by mass) –(reducing sugars before inversion, percent by mass) x 0.95

         2) Nitrogen, mg per gram of sucrose consumed \= 2(a-b)-C Where

      a= initial quantity of sucrose taken for the test b=mass of sucrose as calculated in (a),and

      c= amount of nitrogen fixed per gram of glucose.

5. ### ***Counting***

   1. Count the tubes which have turned blue and have developed typical white sub- surface pellicle.

   2. 	Count the tubes as \+ve or –ve for the presence of sub-surface pellicle and consider for the purpose of calculation.

   3. ### ***Method for Estimating MPN Count***

      1. To calculate the most probable number of organisms in the original sample, select as P1 the number of positive tubes in the least concentrated dilution in which all tubes are positive or in which the greatest number of tubes is \+ve, and let P2 and P3 represent the numbers of positive tubes in the next two higher dilutions.

      2. Then find the row of numbers in Table 1 in which P1 and P2 correspond to the values observed experimentally. Follow that row of numbers across the table to the column headed by the observed value of P.

      3. The figure at the point of intersection is the most probable number of organisms in the quantity of original sample represented in the inoculum added in the second dilution. Multiply this figure by the appropriate dilution factor to obtain the MPN value.

3. ## **Procedure**

   “(i) Preparation of Sample

   Pure culture medium same as at 2.1 above excluding agar.

   Prepare broth medium in 100 ml aliquots in 6 no., 250 ml conical flasks and sterilize in autoclave at 1210C for 20 min.

2) Inoculation of Medium

   Select one PSB colony of the type that has been counted as PSB (showing sufficient zone of solubilization) and streak on set medium as described at

   2.1 in a Petri dish. Use this pure culture for inoculating the broth. Inoculate 3 flasks and keep 3 flasks as uninoculated control. Incubate the flasks over rotary shaker for 12 days at 28+10C.

   After 12 days, filter the contents of each flask separately through Whatman No. 42 filter paper or centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 15 min.

3) Add 10 ml of filtrate/ centrifugate to 50 ml of olsen extractant and shake for 30 min over rotary shaker.

4) Filter the suspension through Whatman filter paper No. 40\. If the filtrate is coloured then add a tea spoon of Dacro-60 (activated phosphorous free carbon), reshake and filter.

5) Take a known aliquot (5 to 25 ml) of the extract in a 50 ml volumetric flask.

6) Add 5 drops of p-nitrophenol indicator (1.5 per cent solution in water) and adjust the pH of the extract between 2 and 3 with the help of 4NH2SO4. The yellow colour will disappear when the pH of the solution becomes 3\. Swirl gently to avoid loss of the solution along with the evolution of CO2.

7) 	When the CO2 evolution has subsided, wash down the neck of the flask and dilute the solution to about 40 ml.

8) 	Add 5 ml of the sulphomolybdic acid mixed reagent containing ascorbic acid, swirl the content and make up the volume.

9) Measure the transmission after 30 min at 880 nm using red filter. The blue colour developed remains stable upto 60 minutes.

   (a) **By sieving**

      ## **Equipment and Reagent**

      Stalking sieves with nylon or stainless steel mesh and a large range of pore sizes for isolating spores from the carrier or soil sample

         * 40-50 micron (0.04 mm) seive for small sized spores

         * 100 micron (0.10 mm) sieve for medium sized spores

   b. **Procedure** \- Mix the Soil in a substantial volume of water and decant through a series of sieves arranged in descending order of mesh size. Roots and coarse debris are collected on a coarse (60-ISS) sieve, while spores are captured on one or more finer sieves. Vigorous washing with water is necessary to free spores from aggregates of clay or organic materials. Collect the sieving in jars. Transfer the sieving onto the grided petri dishes/plate and observe under stereomicroscope. Count the number of spores in plate/dish and express it as spores/g of the sample.

   ## **c. By sucrose gradient**

* Avoid exposure of MTT solution to light, as the stain is light sensitive.

* Add freshly collected AMF spores (approximately 100 in number) collected by any of the two methods described above, to the staining solution and incubate at 270C in sterile eppendorf in dark.  
* Observe the spores for different colour reactions using stereomicroscope under dark field after 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours of incubation.

* Spores, which stained red or pink, are treated as viable.

  **% Spore viability \= No. of spores which stained red or pink X 100**

  **Total number of spores**

  4. **Assessment of Infectivity Potential**

  The bioassay is used to determine the number of infective propagules present in the product. Once the infective propagules (spores, mycelia and vesicles in the root fragments) come in contact with the host roots they give out a turgid mycelial structure \- the appressoria, which is the initial step in the penetration event. This appressoria enters the root through an ‘entry point’. This entry point can be visualized by staining and enumerated as a measure of the infectivity of the inoculum. Host plants are grown from pre germinated seeds and a known weight of the inoculum is applied to experimental host plant in pots. These pots are maintained for 14 days after which they are harvested, the root length measured and then stained. The resulting entry points are counted to ascertain the infectivity potential.

## **(A) Equipments and Reagents**

1. Pots (5 x 7 cm in size)

2. Sorghum seeds (*Sorghum vulgare*)

3. Scissors and needles

4. Petri dish ( grided )

5. Water bath

6. Glass slides and cover slips

7. Compound microscope

8. Coarse sieve to prevent root loss during washing/changing solutions

9. Plastic vials with tight-sealing lids for storage of stained samples in 50% glycerol

10. Potassium hydroxide solution (5-10%)

11. Alkaline H2O2 (25% Ammonia solution: 3 ml \+ 10% H2O2: 30 ml \+ Distilled water 67 ml)  
12. 1% HCl

13. 50% glycerol-water (v/v) solution for de-staining and storage of stained roots.

14. Lactoglycerol (Lactic acid: 876 ml \+ Glycerine: 64 ml \+ Distilled water: 60 ml)

## **(B) Staining solutions**

1. 0.01 % acid fuschin: 0.01 g acid fuschin in 100ml acetoglycerol.

2. 0.05% trypan blue: 0.05 g trypan blue in 100ml acetoglycerol.

3. 0.03% Chlorozol black E ( CBE) in lactoglycerol ( 1:1:1 lactic acid, glycerol and water ).

4. Dissolve CBE in water before adding equal volumes of lactic acid and glycerol.

## **(C) Procedure**

* Place 100 g test sample in a pot

* Dilute the inoculum with sterilized sand if the inoculum is very rich

* Plant 10-12 pre germinated seeds of Sorghum and grow for 14 days

* Harvest the pots and recover roots (fine roots can be rescued using sieve) completely.  
* Chop the roots equally 1 cm in length.

* Measure and record the root length (using grid line intersect method described below) from each sample/dilution.

* Clear the roots in KOH solution and stain the root pieces (described below)

* Count the number of infection points/entry points formed on randomly picked 100 segments

* Calculate the average number of entry points formed in 1 cm segment

* Calculate the total number of infection points/infective propagules (IP) by multiplying the average number of entry points formed in 1 cm segment by the total root length.

* Extrapolate the IP present as numbers per gram of substrate/inoculum

## **(D) Estimation of root length (Tennant D 1975\)**

1) **Equipment**

   1. Scissors

   2. Petri dish (9 cm in size consisting 1.33 cm x 1.33 cm grids )

   3. Wash bottle

   4. Stereo zoom microscope

2) The lines intersect (Tennant 1975\) method is used to estimate the length of hyphae and roots. Root length is measured by dispersing roots against a grid of squares on the bottom of a tray. The roots are spread apart from one another over a grid in 2 mm to 10-mm depth of water. The eyes of the observer are cast along all the horizontal and vertical lines of the grid and root is counted using a hand held click counter.

   The root length is calculated as follows:

   ## **Root length \= No. of intersects x 11/14 x grid size**

   Where, 11/14 is a constant, and the size of the grid is the length of one side of one square of the grid.

   ## **Counting root intersections**

   1. Randomly disperse root in dish with grid lines.

   2. Count the intersects on roots across the horizontal and vertical lines.

   3. An example of 10 root segments is presented to show how the root length is calculated

Total number of intersects \= HI+VI \= 8 \+ 7 (example) \= 15

Thus, the root length \= 11/14 X 15 X 1 (as the grid size is 1cm) \= 11 cm (example)

3) ## **Clearing and staining root specimens**

Clearing and staining procedures requires root samples that should be washed free of soil. It is important that KOH and staining solution volumes are sufficient for the amount of roots being processed and that, roots are not tightly clumped together for uniform contact with solutions. To ensure uniform staining, the roots should be chopped in to smaller (1-2 cm) segments.

1) Wash root specimens under running tap water thoroughly. Place them in beaker containing 5-10% KOH solution for about 15-30 minutes. The concentration of KOH and time of incubation of roots depend upon the age and tenderness of the roots.

2) Pour off the KOH solution and rinse the roots well in a beaker using at least three complete changes of tapwater or until no brown colour appears in the rinse water.  
3) Cover the roots with alkaline H2O2 at room temperature for 10 minutes or until roots are bleached.  
4) Rinse the roots thoroughly using at least three complete changes of tap water to remove the H2O2.  
5) Cover the roots with 1% HCl and soak for 3-4 min. And then pour off the solution. DO NOT rinse after this step because the specimens must be acidified for proper staining.

6) Incubate the roots with staining solution (0.01% acid fuchsine in lactoglycerol or 0.05% trypan blue in lacto phenol) and keep them overnight for staining.

7) Place the root specimens in glass petriplate /multiwell plate for destaining. The destaining solution (50% glycerol) is the standard used in step 4, but of course, without the stain.

4) ## **Sample storage and slide preparation**

If clearing and staining is not possible immediately then fresh roots can be kept moist and stored at 5 °C (for several days), or may be preserved in 50% ethanol for months together in tightly sealed vials.

Staining quality is subsequently improved by destaining roots in 50% glycerol for several months prior to observation to allow excess stain to leach from roots.  
Semi-permanent slides of stained roots can be made with PVLG mountant. For temporary slide the stained roots can be observed in plain lactoglycerol.

## **Part- C**

**PROCEDURE FOR DRAWL OF SAMPLE OF ORGANIC FERTILISER**

(As per methodology as mentioned under schedule-ii, part-A of FCO,1985)

The Inspector shall draw any sample of Organic fertilizer in accordance with the procedure of drawl mentioned under schedule-ii, Part-A.

1. ## **General requirements of sampling**

In drawing samples, the following measures and precautions should be observed:

1) Samples shall not be taken at a place exposed to rain /sun.

   2) The sampling instruments shall be clean and dry when used.

   3) The material being sampled, the sampling instruments and the bags of samples should be free from any adventitious contaminations.

   4) To draw a representative sample, the contents of each bag selected for sampling should be mixed as thoroughly as possible by suitable means.

   5) The sample should be kept in suitable, clean dry and airtight glass or screwed hard polythene bottle of about 400gm capacity or in a thick-gauged polythene bag. This should be put in a cloth bag, which may be sealed with the Inspector’s seal after putting inside the detailed description as specified in Form ‘P’. Identifiable details may also be put on the cloth bag like sample No./Code No. or any other details which enables its identification.

   6) Each sample bag should be sealed air tight after filling and marked with details of sample and type of fertilizer and the name of Inspector who has collected sample.

## **2  Sampling from bagged material**

1) **Scale of sampling**

   1) **Lot (for manufacturers/importers) \-** All bags in a single consignment of the material of the same grade and type drawn from a single batch of the manufacturer/importer shall constitute a lot. If a consignment is declared to consist of different batches of manufacturer/import, all the bags of each batch shall constitute a separate lot. In the case of a consignment drawn from a continuous process, 2000 bags (or 100 tonnes) of the material shall constitute a lot.

   2) **Lot (for dealer)** \- The lot is an identifiable quantity of same grade and type of fertilizer stored at an identifiable place subject to a maximum limit of 100 tones. The inspector based on visible appearance of bags, their packing and storage conditions shall identify the lot. The stock of less than 100 tones with a dealer may also constitute one or more lots, if the material (fertiliser) of different sources and brand is available in such quantities.

   3) **Selection of bags for sampling \-** The number of bags to be chosen from a lot shall depend upon the size of the lot as given below:

| Lot size (No. of bags) (N) | No. of bags to be selected for sampling(n) |
| :---- | :---: |
| Upto 10 | 1 |
| 11-100 | 2 |
| 101-200 | 3 |
| 201-400 | 4 |
| 401-600 | 5 |
| 601-800 | 6 |
| 801-1000 | 7 |
| 1001-1300 | 8 |
| 1301-1600 | 9 |
| 1601-2000 | 10 |

All the bags of a lot should be arranged in a systematic manner. Start counting from any bag randomly; go on counting as 1,2,3,…………..up to R and so on. R being equal to the integral of N/n. Thus every 4th bag counted shall be withdrawn

and all bags shall constitute the sample bags from where the sample is to be drawn for preparing a composite sample.

2) **Sampling from big godowns/high stackings** \- If the procedure given in Para 2 (i)(c) is not possible to be adopted, the sample should be drawn from the randomly selected fertilizer bags from different layers, from top and from all open sides in a zig zag fashion.

3) **Sampling from small godowns** \- All the fertilizer bags of the same grade and type of each manufacturer though received on different dates shall be segregated and properly stacked. All bags of same grade and type of fertilizer manufactured by a particular manufacturing unit may be considered as one lot based on their physical conditions and the sample shall be drawn as per procedure laid down in para 2 (i) (c) and 4\.

4) ## **Sampling from damaged stocks**

   1) In case of torn or lumpy bags, damaged fertilizer bags or sweepings, the stock should be arranged according to identifiable lots. From each lot the number of bags shall be selected as per procedure 2 (i) (c). If the bags allow the use of sampling probe conveniently, the samples should be drawn from sampling probe.

   2) In case it is not possible to use the sampling probe, the bags may be opened and fertilizer material mixed together uniformly by hammering the big lumps or putting pressure, if required, and then samples drawn by using suitable sample device.

3. ## **Sampling probe**

   1) An appropriate sampling instrument to be used by the Inspector for collection of a representative sample is called sampling probe. The probe may comprise of a slotted single tube with solid cone tip made of stainless steel or brass. The length of the probe may be approximately 60 to 65 cms and the diameter of the tube may be approximately 1.5 cm and the slot width may be 1.2 to 1.3 cms. The probe may be used if the physical condition of the fertilizers and the packing material permits its use.

   2) In case of high-density polythene packing and also when the fertilizer material is not in free flowing condition, the use of sampling probe may not be possible. In such case, selected bags for drawing samples may be opened and the fertilizers may be taken out of the bags and spread on a clean surface and samples drawn with the help of a suitable sampling device, which may be made of stainless steel or brass cup.

4. ## **Drawal of samples from bags**

   1) Drawal of sample and preparation of composite samples.

   Draw, with an appropriate sampling instrument, (sampling probe) small portions of the material from the selected bags as per procedure in para 2(i) (b), 2(ii), 2(iii) and 2(iv) (a). The sampling probe shall be inserted in the bag from one corner to another diagonally and when filled with fertilizer, the probe is withdrawn and fertilizer is emptied in a container/ or on polythene sheet/ or on a clean hard surface and made into one composite sample.

   2) If the bags do not permit the use of sampling probe, empty the contents of the bags on a level, clean and hard surface and draw a composite sample by the process of quartering as described under para 3(ii) or 5\.

## **4A. Weight of one Sample**

One sample of organic fertilizer shall have approximate 400gms weight.

5. ## **Preparation of composite sample**

If the composite sample collected from the different selected bags is larger than required weight, its size shall be reduced by method of quartering as detailed below:-  
Spread the composite sample on a level, clean, hard surface, flatten it out and divide it into four equal parts. Remove any diagonally opposite parts. Mix the two remaining parts together to form a cone, flatten out the cone and repeat the operation of quartering till a composite sample of required weight is obtained.

6. ## **Preparation of test sample and reference sample**

1) The composite sample obtained above shall be spread out on a clean, hard surface and divided into three approximately equal portions each of the weight as specified in Para 4A. Each of these samples shall constitute the test sample.

2) Each test sample shall be immediately transferred to a suitable container as defined under para 1(e). The slip with detailed description may be put inside the sample bag. Each bag shall also be properly labeled as mentioned in para 1(f).

3) Each test sample container shall then be sealed with seals of the inspector, if possible, seal of the manufacturer/ importer/ dealer or purchaser as the case may be also be affixed.

4) Out of the three samples collected, one sample so sealed shall be sent to the Incharge of the laboratory notified by the state Government under clause 29 or National/Regional Centre of Organic Farming, Ghaziabad, Bangalore, Bhubaneshwar, Hisar, Imphal, Jabalpur or Nagpur for analysis. Another sample shall be given to the manufacturer or importer or dealer or the purchaser, as the case may be. The third sample shall be sent by the Inspector to his next higher authority for keeping in safe custody. Any of the latter two samples may be sent for referee analysis as provided for under sub-clause (2) of clause 29B.

9. ## **Estimation of Potassium**

**Flame photometry method**:- Total Potassium are usually determined by dry ashing at 650-700 Degree Centigrade and dissolving in concentrated hydrochloric acid.

## **Reagent and Standard curve**

1) Potassium chloride standard solution: Make a stock solution of 1000 ppm K by dissolving 1.909 g. of AR grade potassium chloride (dried at 60oC for 1 h) in distilled water 1 ; and diluting up to 1 litre. Prepare 100 ppm standard by diluting 100 ml of 1000 ppm stock solution to 1 litre with extracting solution.

2) Standard curve: Pipette 0,5, 10,15 and 20 ml of 100 ppm solution into 100 ml volumetric flasks and make up the volume upto the mark. The solution contain 0, 5, 15 & 20 ppm K respectively.

## **Procedure:**

* Take 5g sample in a porcelain crucible and ignite the material to ash at 650- 700 C in a muffle furnace.  
  * Cool it and dissolve in 5 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid, transfer in a 250 ml beaker with several washing of distilled water and heat it.  
  * Again transfer it to a 100 ml volumetric flask and make up the volume.

  * Filter the solution and dilute the filtrate with distilled water so that the concentration of K in the working solution remains in the range of 0 to 20 ppm, if required.  
  * Determine K by flame photometer using the K- filter after necessary setting and calibration of the instrument.  
  * Read similarly the different concentration of K of the standard solution in flame photometer and prepare the standard curve by plotting the reading against the different concentration of the K.  
  * Calculation: Potash (K) %by weight \= R X 20 X diluting factor, where R= ppm of K in the sample solution (obtained by extra plotting from standard curve).

2. ## **Confirmative Test**

Confirmative test is for differentiating the coliforms from non-coliforms as well as Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. In this test, the EMB agar plates are inoculated with sample from positive tubes producing gas. Emergence of small colonies with dark centres confirms the presence of Gram negative, lactose fermenting coliform bacteria. Sometimes some of the non-coliforms also produce gas, therefore, this test is necessary.

1. Prepare EMB agar plates with the composition as per the method given above

   2. Inoculate plates with the help of inoculation loop with streaking of samples showing positive/doubtful tests in the presumptive test

   3. Incubate plates at 30± 1oC for 12 h in incubator

   4. Dark centred or nucleated colonies appear which may differentiate between

   *E. coli* and *E. aerogenes* based on size of colonies and metallic sheen

## **Result**

*E. coli* colonies on this medium are small with metallic sheen, where as *E. aerogenes* colonies are usually large and lack the sheen.

3. ## **Completed Test**

This test is required for further confirmation.

## **Procedure**

1. Pick up a single colony from EMB agar plate

   2. Inoculate it into lactose broth and streak on a nutrient agar slant

   3. Incubate the slants

   4. Perform Gram reaction after attaining the growth

## **Result**

Gram-negative nature of bacteria is indicative of a positive completed test.”
