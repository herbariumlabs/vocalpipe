# ASSESSMENT OF LOSS/ SHORTFALL IN YIELD

WideSpread Calamities (based on season-end yield)

1.  The Scheme will operate on the basis of 'Arca Approach' i.e., Defined Areas for each notified crop for widespread calamities. State Goviirnment Department overseeing condut, of CCEs will submit yield data as per cut-off date decided by SLCCCI. along with results of individual CCEs. Yield data will be furnished to Insurance Company by State Government, in arrordance with the cut-off dates fixed, and crops and areas notified, based on total number of CCEsheing conducted. The certifirate that CCEs data is being submitted based on single series would be furnished along \\'Vith yield data every season.
2.  CCEs shall be undertaken per unit area ofinsurance per crop, as indic.ited below:

### Level of Insurance Unit of CCEs , Minimum Sample Size

Village/ Villag\_e Panch at (GP) 4

Revenue Cirrle 10

Sub·Division I6

\------=D=i=str=ict--- 24 '

1.  In order to maintain the sanctity and credibility of CCEs as an objective method of yield estimation, the modalities mentioned below will be followed:
    1.  State shall strength(m audit process of rondu(:l of CCEs, with necess,ny checks and balances. Oigilizing the CCE process including geo-roding (providing the latitude and longitude of the CCE location), date/ time-stamping aod with photographs (of the CCE plot and CCE activity), is a must for all CCEs.
    2.  States shall maintain 'single series' of'CCEs, i.e. the same set of CCEs and Yield estimates are used both for Crop Production estimates and Crop Insurance.

r) The yield estimates at Ill level shall he submitted hy the State Government within the cut­ off date,along with results of individual CCEs to the insurance companies.

1.  Insurance company would be giv(!n rompletc access to co-witness the CCf-:s, .is also the digital images of the CCEs and relevant data in the requisite form by the State Government. A formal letter with the srhcclulc should be given to the lAs sufficiently in advance without fail to help them mobilize the manpower if theyso desire.
2.  Wherever the yield estimates reported ,ll IU lcvd are abnormally low or·high vis-ii-vis the general crop condition, the insuranrc rornpany in consultation with Swte Government can make use of various products (e.g. NornwlizE•d DifferenCE! Vegetation Index, ctr.) derived from satellite image data or other technologies to confirm the yield estimates. ln case of signific.int differences between these two yield estimates, the matter should be referred to Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) at Centre and its decision shall be fin,il.
3.  Use of Mobile Phone Technology to improvl, Yield-data Quality and Timeliness

To increase the reliability, accuracy and speed of CCE data, it is mandatory to us,, smart phones / hand held devices for capturing images, location of the CCI:. and for online transmission of data on centralized server (e.g. Bhuvan server) would be done for faster compilation of data and quick claim settlement. RST and Drones etc. may also be used for the purpose of increasing accuracy and speed of yield estimation through CCEs.

### Assessment ofClaims (Wide Spread Cala1nities)

If 'Actual Yield' (AY) per hect,1re of insured rrop for the insurance unit (calculated on basis of requisite number of CCEs) in insured season, falls short of specified 'Threshold Yield' (TY), all insured farmers gro,'lfing that crop in the defined area are deemed to have suffered shortfall in yield of similar magnitude. f>MFBY seeks to provide coverage against such contingency.

'Claim' shall be calculated as per the following formula:

(Threshold Yield· Actual Yield)
