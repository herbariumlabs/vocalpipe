{"question":"Summarize AGRI VISION 2025.","expected_answer":"Agriculture plays a vital role in the economy of Assam contributing 35% to the State Domestic Product in 1996-97 at constant (1980-81) price. The Government has, therefore, assigned very high priority to agriculture. This was reflected through a quantum jump in rice production to 39 lakh MT in 1999-2000 from the level of 31.55 lakh MT and 33.83 lakh MT in 1998-99 and 1997-98, respectively. This was achieved through creation of assured Shallow Tube Well irrigation with assistance of World Bank (ARIASP) and NABARD (SKY) scheme. Although regular flood, drought, heavy population pressure on land and infrastructural weakness are impediments to growth, yet the farmers have started to increase production through technological innovations and appropriate Government policies. During the next quarter century, the tempo of raising productivity and production must be accelerated along with integration of our economy with outside economies necessitated in the aftermath of liberalization.","expected_keywords":["through","production","lakh","agriculture","economy","government","plays","vital"],"source":"/Users/rahulbarman/Documents/Coding/Herbarium/vocalpipe/datasets/Assam Law and Policy/ASSAM AGRI VISION 2025.md"}

{"question":"Give a brief overview of STATE AGRICULTURE POLICY,ASSAM.","expected_answer":"Assam is predominantly rural and the economy primarily agrarian in nature with almost 70% of the population directly dependent on Agriculture as a source of income and another 15% of the population dependent on allied activities for its living. It is for this reason that any strategy for the development of the State will have to keep agriculture at the centre of its planning process. If we look at the development of agriculture in Assam since independence, the scenario in terms of productivity and production has been mixed. We have achieved self-sufficiency in rice, the staple crop, but we still have a shortfall in overall requirement of oilseed, pulses and wheat. We have a surplus production of fruits and vegetables, but almost 40% of the crop is lost because of post harvest losses. The future of rice production too, is not assured in the State, largely because of poor price realization. If one were to consider the fertility of the land and the abundance of water in the State, the two most important components for agricultural growth, Assam should have been one of the better-developed States in the country.
