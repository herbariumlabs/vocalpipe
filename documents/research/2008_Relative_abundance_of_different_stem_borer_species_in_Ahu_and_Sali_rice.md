### ABSTRACT

```
Stem borer complex of rice at the Instructional-Cum-Research Farm, Assam Agricultural University (AAU),
Jorhat, Assam, during 2005, comprised of five species of lepidopteran borers viz., the pyralids, Scirpophaga
innotata (Walker), S. incertulas (Walker), Chilo suppressalis (Walker), C. polychrysus (Meyrick) and the
noctuid Sesamia inferens (Walker). S. innotata was the predominant species followed by S. incertulas while S.
inference was the least abundant species of the borer complex. Larval population of S. innotata was 43.39,
41.96 and 35.43 per cent of the total borer population at tillering, maximum tillering and at heading stages of
the crop, respectively during the Ahu season, while in Sali season the corresponding percentage was 44.73,
41.48 and 37.50. The population of S. innotata as hibernating larvae was 34.4 per cent. Moth population of S.
innotata constituted 73.71 and 72.84 per cent of the total borer complex during Ahu and Sali seasons,
respectively. Pink borer, S. inferens was the least abundant species during both the Ahu and Sali seasons.

Rice is cultivated in Assam mainly as winter orSali
rice (June-July to November-December). It is also
grown as autumn orAhu (March-April to June-July)
and as summer orBoro rice (November-December to
May-June). There are several important factors
affecting the level of production of rice crop of which
the insect pest problem is a major factor.

The stem borers are among the major pests
that attack the rice crop from seedling stage at nursery
to maturity in the field and cause significant economic
loss.They are chronic pests and attack theAhu, Sali,
Bao (deep water rice) andBoro crops. Though
research on borer complex of rice has already been
done by different workers from different parts of India
and abroad, information from North-East India, is very
much scanty. From earlier report, it is seen that yellow
stem borer,Scirpophaga incertulas Walker is the
predominant species of the borer complex of rice in
Assam (Bora, 1993). But, in recent times, it has been
observed that white stem borer,S. innotata Walker is
becoming more and more abundant and constitutes a
major proportion of the total borer complex of rice.
Hence, the present study was undertaken to work out

```
the borer complex of rice and the relative abundance
of different species.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study on the relative abundance of rice stem borer
was undertaken in the Instructional-Cum-Research
Farm, Assam Agricultural University (AAU), Jorhat,
Assam during 2005.Ahu (variety- Gopinath) andSali
(variety- Ranjit) rice was separately grown in two areas
of 5000 m^2 each, out of which 2000m^2 plots from each
variety were selected for the study. DuringAhu 25
days old seedlings were transplanted on 10th April, 2005
while inSali 30 days old seedlings were transplanted
on 25th July, 2005 by following recommended package
of practices (AAU, 2004-05). No insecticide was
applied during the entire crop season.
The larval population was observed at tillering,
maximum tillering and heading stages. During each
observation, tillers of 100 infested hills (dead hearts or
white ear heads) were randomly selected, dissected
and observation on different species of borer present
was recorded. Hibernating borer larvae were also
studied during December to January after harvest of

Sali crop. For this observation, 560 hills of rice stubbles
were randomly selected. The stubbles were brought to
the laboratory and dissected to examine the presence
of hibernating borer. Species composition of stem borer
moths was also studied weekly from one week after
transplanting till harvest of the crop. During each
observation the number of moths of different borer
species was recorded by walking diagonally across the
fields. The relative abundance of each species was
worked out on the basis of percentage of each species
in the total borer complex. The moths and larvae
collected in the field were brought to the laboratory for
further taxonomic studies. The moths were preserved
in clean test tubes plugged with cotton and the larvae
were preserved in vials containing 70 per cent alcohol.
The collected borer specimens were identified following
the keys given by Nishida and Torii (1970) and Khanet
al. (1991).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The present study revealed that the rice stem borer
complex at Jorhat, Assam comprised of five species of
lepidopteran borersviz., the pyralidsS. innotata,S.
incertulas, Chilo supp ressalis (Walke r), C.
polychrysus(Meyrick) and the noctuid Sesamia
inferens (Walker). Bora (1993) and Anonymous (2004-

```
05) also reported similar observation from Assasm.
Moreover, the white stem borer,S. innotatawas found
to be the predominant species followed by yellow stem
borer,S. incertulas while the pink stem borer, S.
inferens was the least abundant species.
Larval population ofS. innotata was 43.39,
41.96 and 35.43 per cent at tillering, maximum tillering
and at heading stages, respectively during theAhu
season (Table 1), whereas inSali season the population
was 44.73, 41.48 and 37.50 per cent corresponding to
tillering, maximum tillering and heading stages of the
crop (Table 2). The population of the borer as
hibernating larvae was 34.4 per cent (Table 3). Moth
population ofS. innotata constituted 73.71 and 72.
per cent of the total borer complex duringAhu and
Sali seasons, respectivel y (Table 4). Similar
observations have also been recorded from Titabar,
Assam (Anonymous, 2004-2005). This is, however, in
contrast to earlier observation of Bora (1993) who
reportedS. incertulas as the predominant species that
constituted more than 70 per cent of the stem borer
complex.
Larval population ofS. incertulaswas 25.47, 27.
and 31.50 per cent during theAhu season (Table 1)
and 24.56, 20.00 and 30.83 per cent during theSali
season corresponding to tillering, maximum tillering and

heading stages of the crop (Table 2). The population of
the borer as hibernating larvae was 25.60 per cent
(Table 3). Moth population ofS. incertulas constituted
22.43 and 23.84 per cent of the total borer complex
duringAhu andSali seasons, respectively (Table 4).

Data presented in Table 1 revealed that, in the
Ahu season larval population ofC. supressaliswas
higher than that of C. polychrysus during tillering
(15.09 and 13.20 %, respectively) and maximum tillering
stages (13.39 and 11.60 %, respectively), while at
heading stageC. polychrysus population (14.96 %)
was higher than that ofC. supressalis (12.60 %).
However, in the Sali season, population of C.
polychrysus was higher than that ofC. supressalis
during the maximum tillering (17.78 and 14.07 %,
respectively) and heading stages (14.16 and 11.66 %,
respectively) of the crop (Table 2).

The pink stem borer,S. inferenswas the least
abundant species of the borer complex at Jorhat, Assam.
The larval populationwas 2.83, 5.35 and 5.50 per cent
during theAhu season (Table 1), whereas in theSali
season the population was 4.38, 6.66 and 5.83 per cent
corresponding to tillering, maximum tillering and heading
stages of the crop (Table 2). The population of the borer
as hibernating larvae was 8.80 per cent (Table 3) and
moth population ofS. inferens constituted 0.64 and 0.
per cent of the total borer complex duringAhu and
Sali seasons, respectively (Table 4).

Thus it was clear thatS. innotata was the predominant
species followed by S. incertulus whileS. inferens
was the least abundant species. Although the reason
for the predominance of S. innotata over other species
during recent times is not clearly understood, several

```
factors might have contributed to it. Analysis of 15 years
annual rainfall data (Fig. 1) of Jorhat, Assam (collected
from Department of Agricultural Meteorology, AAU,
Jorhat), depicted that distribution of annual rainfall and
total rainfall for both the crop season (March to
November) decreased over the years, which might be
the reason for the dominance of S. innotata as it occurs
in regions with distinct dry and wet seasons (Otanes
and Sison, 1952). The dominance of white stem borer
has also been reported from Malaysia (Rothschild, 1971)
and Philippines (Lumaban and Litsinger, 1980).S.
inferens being a polyphagous pest and least adapted to
the aquatic conditions prevailing in the region was
expected to be least abundant species (Catlinget al.,
1984). Similar observations have also been recorded
by Pandaet al.,(1977) from Orissa, Panktey and
Sachan (1983) from Nagaland and Ahmed and
Shahjahan (1981) from Bangladesh.
