## HORTI VISION 2020

Assam is a traditionally horticultural State and the socio – economic fabric of its people is largely constituted by horticultural components. The horticultural beauty lies in its history, culture, traditions and in the mindset of the people – which has imbibed a lot from this colorful science of fruits, flowers, vegetables, spices, plantation crops, root & tuber crops, nut crops, medicinals , aromatics, mushroom, bee keeping and lately bamboo. With a mere acrage of 5.46 lakh hectors under horticulture, out of gross cropped area of 36.37 lakh ha, it is only 15% of this area but has a lot to say if we are to deliberate in terms of its economic and social contribution and more importantly, to see Horticulture in accordance with aspirations and expectations of coming generation in the years to come or precisely by the year 2020 and beyond. Horticulture has a commitment that no other sector may perhaps can come up as parallel i.e in terms of its importance to achieve nutritional security and as a most viable component of environment friendly industrial base. This is a sector gaining importance day by day and the reason behind for calling it as sunrise area are – diverse nature of its products to suit different agro climatic situation, higher bio mass production per unit area and thereby more income per unit area, scope for improvement in rural diet with least investment or any extra effort, scope for massive employment generation, unveiling new horizons of value addition and the science itself being intellectually satisfying with aesthetic outlook has an universal appeal for both developed and developing nations. The situation can be looked under Assam‟s perspective as here under :

1.  Horticultural sector which includes fruits, vegetables, tuber crops, floriculture, mushroom, medicinal & aromatic plants, spices and plantation crops have proved beyond doubt to be the best diversification of agriculture for better land use.
2.  The soil and climate is so ideal for a wide range of horticultural crops that experts comment Assam as a „Sleeping Giant‟.
3.  According to latest survey on children aged 1 to 4 and pregnant women in Assam, 50.4% of them suffer from under weight and the growth of 52.5% are stunted. So individual dietary improvement through nutritional horticulture is the need of the hour- which is easily achievable and most viable.
4.  Tremendous scope for employment generation including farm- women through horticultural ventures & self employment horticultural schemes.
5.  Sustainable approach to raise productivity is best suited when horticulture is taken into account due our existing production system approach.
6.  The natural flora of Assam have huge number of hitherto unexploited medicinal and aromatic plants including minor fruits and orchids. Any strategy to boost up this sector will particularly help local and more particularly tribal farmers. This has a bearing on preserving genetic variability that exists in case of many horticultural crops also.
7.  The State being characterized for low consumption of fertilizer and plant protection chemicals, this so called weakness can be transformed in to strength through adoption of organic farming as the export tract is fast becoming clear for organics only.
8.  Assam being gateway of North East India and the State being strategically located in close proximity to emerging South East Asian markets, has a lot to deliver in years to come.

Keeping these points in view and also considering the requirement against projected population of Assam by the year 2020 and giving top most priority on commercialization of this sectors , crops specific strategies are formulated and a gist of targets of various major sectors of horticulture has been formulated as stated below.

# BAMBOO

Bamboo; No longer an woody grass but a glamorous crop

.

A. **Present Scenario** :

Time has come to rediscover bamboo. It is no longer a “orphan specis” or poor men‟s timber. Pondits in World Bamboo Congress (27.02.2004 to 04.03.04 at New Delhi) have projected this crop as „green gold‟ and referred it as vital for social, ecological and economical security. No other crop has more than 1500 application such as – Bamboo pulp & paper, laser printer and photocopy paper, floor boards, panels , ceiling, medicinal, receipies, cloths, land scaping, eco tourism, building, furniture etc. The annual turnover on bamboo sector projected as Rs. 25 billion, against the market potential of Rs. 45 billion and it is expected to go beyond Rs. 250 billion in near future. India posses 140 specis i.e. just next to China but the productivity is less. Bamboo is reported to be a gold mine for gene tagging. Estimate says that out of 9 million Ha, 1 million ha of bamboo is in Assam. It is revealed that 66% of the total area under Bamboo in India is in the North East and Mizoram share is 33% .

The present world market is dominated by china with its products like Flavonoid of Bamboo leaves, Bamboo juice, panel, veneer container bamboo fabric- proof ceiling (fire proof), Bamboo charcoal, vinegar, soil fungicide, cosmetics, soaps, handicrafts, musical instruments, bonsai, Bamboo garden etc.

It is suggested that there should be primary processing in N.E. India prefarbly Assam, the gateway of Northeast while the final product industries may be anywhere else.

Against this back drop, time has come to outline modelities to develop bamboo sector in Assam. Bamboo is being declared as horticultural crop, the department has to adopt strategies and it is proposed as below :

1.  Package of practice for bamboo and its economics is to be finalized and circulated targeting homestead areas.
2.  Massive training / awareness Programme
3.  Exposure of farmers/ entrepreneurs on recent value addition of bamboo for development of bamboo based industries.
4.  Nursery development and Area expansion.

3.  Value addition.
4.  **Present Scenario :** In Assam mushroom is known to many but there is very limited commercial production and lacking systematic approach**.** The Departmental mushroom spawn production laboratory now being run by private entrepreneurs could develop mushroom owner network under buy back system and the unit is gradually picking up. At present the annual production of fresh mushroom is 2000 tones only against a projected demand of 12,000 tones besides export potential. The total no. of mushroom entrepreneur in the state is about 60 nos but they are mostly seasonal. The most common edible mushroom which is in practice is Oyster mushroom.
5.  **Strategy for increasing production & Quality :**
    1.  Involving more farmers / SHG/Women SHG to venture in the commercial mushroom production.
    2.  Easy availability of spawn.
    3.  Satellites farming
    4.  Processing and value addition.

Assam will have to be more fast in this sector in years to come . The crops that can be immediately targeted are various spices like Ginger, Black pepper, Field Spices, Fruits like Banana, Pineapple, Satkara (Cmarcroptera), Citrus crops, Vegetables, Medicinals and Aromatics, Bamboo etc. Before that it must address vital problems of volume and quality of its produce.

The strategy to boost up this sector will be –

1.  Strengthen production base
2.  Improvement in quality of produce
3.  Maximum possible extension of harvesting period
4.  Cultivation of product specific varieties
5.  Setting up of multi-product processing units – incorporating – Spice products, fruits, vegetable and even medicinal & aromatics.
6.  Setting up of packaging unit and exploring bio packaging & bio preservatives.
7.  Exploring possibility for setting up large or medium scale processing unit with tie-up with satellite processing units (Mini units) at interiors in pockets of production of raw materials.
8.  Adoption of cultivation & processing in accordance with domestic market demand and also visualizing emerging external markets, more particularly South East Asian markets through border trade due to phasing out of trade barriers amongst these countries and easy surface communication to be made as outcome of latest ASEAN & SAARC declarations.
9.  Entrepreneurship friendly rules, regulations policies and pattern of assistance.
