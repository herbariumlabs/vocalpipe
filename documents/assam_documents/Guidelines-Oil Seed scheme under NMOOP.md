# **National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP)**

**Operational Guidelines**

1. ### **INTRODUCTION :**

   India is one of the major oilseeds grower and importer of edible oils. India’s vegetable oil economy is world’s fourth largest after USA, China & Brazil. The oilseed accounts for 13% of the Gross Cropped Area, 3% of the Gross National Product and 10% value of all agricultural commodities. This sector has recorded annual growth rate of area, production and yield @ 2.44%, 5.47% and 2.96% respectively during last decade (1999-2009).

   The diverse agro-ecological conditions in the country are favourable for growing 9 annual oilseed crops, which include 7 edible oilseeds (groundnut, rapeseed & mustard, soybean, sunflower, sesame, safflower and niger) and two non-edible oilseeds (castor and linseed). Oilseeds cultivation is undertaken across the country in about 27 million hectares mainly on marginal lands, of which 72% **is** confined to rainfed farming.

   During the last few years, the domestic consumption of edible oils has increased substantially and has touched the level of 18.90 million tonnes in 2011-12 and is likely to increase further. With per capita consumption of vegetable oils at the rate of 16 kg/year/person for a projected population of 1276 million, the total vegetable oils demand is likely to touch 20.4 million tonnes by 2017\.

   A substantial portion of our requirement of edible oil is met through import of palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia.

   It is, therefore, necessary to exploit domestic resources to maximize production to ensure edible oil security for the country. Oil Palm is comparatively a new crop in India and is the highest vegetable oil yielding perennial crop. With quality planting materials, irrigation and proper management, there is potential of achieving 20-30 MT Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFBs) per ha after attaining **the** age of 5 years. Therefore, there is an urgent need to intensify efforts for area expansion under oil palm to enhance palm oil production in the country.

   Tree Borne Oilseeds (TBOs), like sal, mahua, simarouba, kokum, olive, karanja, jatropha, neem, jojoba, cheura, wild apricot, walnut, tung etc. are

   cultivated/grow**n** in the country under different agro-climatic conditions in a scattered form in forest and non-forest areas as well as in waste land /deserts/hilly areas. These TBOs are also good source of vegetable oil and therefore need to be supported for cultivation.

2. ### **MISSION TARGETS:**

   National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP) envisages increase in production of vegetable oils sourced from oilseeds, oil palm and TBOs from 7.06 million tonnes (average of 2007-08 to 2011-12) to 9.51 million tonnes by the end of Twelfth Plan (2016-17). The Mission is proposed to be implemented through three Mini Missions with specific target as detailed below:

| Mini Mission (MM) | Target of 12th Plan |
| :---- | ----- |
| MM I on Oilseeds | Achieve production of 35.51 million tones and productivity of 1328 kg/ha of oilseeds from the present average production & productivity of 28.93 million **tonnes** and 1081 kg/ha during the 11th Plan period respectively. |
| MM II on Oil Palm | Bring additional 1.25 lakh hectare area under oil palm cultivation through area expansion approach in the States including utilization of wastelands with increase in productivity of fresh fruit brunches (FFBs) from 4927 kg per ha to 15000 kg per ha. |
| MM III on TBOs | Enhance seed collection of TBOs from 9 lakh **tonnes** to 14 lakh tonnes and to augment elite planting materials for area expansion under waste land. |

3. ### **STRATEGY:**

   The strategy to implement the proposed Mission will include increasing Seed Replacement Ratio (SRR) with focus on Varietal Replacement; increasing irrigation coverage under oilseeds from 26% to 36%; diversification of area from low yielding cereals crops to oilseeds crops; inter-cropping of oilseeds with cereals/ pulses/ sugarcane; use of fallow land after paddy /potato cultivation; expansion of cultivation of Oil Palm & TBOs in watersheds and wastelands; increasing availability of quality planting materials of Oil Palm & TBOs; enhancing procurement of oilseeds and collection & processing of TBOs. Inter cropping during gestation period of oil palm and TBOs would provide economic return to the farmers when there is no production. The scheme would be implemented in a mission mode through active involvement **o**f

   all the stakeholders. Fund flow would be monitored to ensure that benefit of the Mission reaches the targeted beneficiaries in time to achieve the targeted results.

4. ### **FUNDING PATTERN & FUND FLOW:**

   Cost of the interventions proposed under the Mission will be in the ratio of 75:25 between the Central and the State Government**s**, except in case of few ongoing interventions like, purchase of Breeder seeds, supply of seed minikits, infrastructure development for seed production through Public Sector agencies like NSC, SFCI, SAUs including KVKs, for FLDs**,** procurement support to NAFED, TRIFED; R\&D support for ongoing research projects. Upto 1% of the funds allocated under the Mission will be earmarked at national and state level to meet the contingency expenditure including engagement of contractual manpower for monitoring of implementation of the Mission.

   The funds will be released to the Departments of Agriculture/Horticulture of the State Governments. As far as possible, electronic banking will be used for transfer of funds to the State /Agencies. The private sectors and NGOs could be involved through the State Department**s** of Agriculture and Horticulture only. The Government of India will release the funds to the agencies for the direct funded components/activities at Central level. The State Govt. will be responsible for release of 25% share of the allocation annually in the beginning of the financial year. The oilseeds and oil palm development programme of ISOPOM **alongwith** liability of ISOPOM and tree borne oilseeds development programme for the approved programme will be subsumed under the Mission. The oilseeds development components of MMA stand discontinued in the States of Assam, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Tripura and Nagaland with the launch of NMOOP. No permanent posts will be created by the Central or the State Governments under NMOOP.

   Past experiences reveal that most of the State Governments held up the allocated/released funds of the Governments of India, besides, non-accordance of sanction for the States matching share. Delayed/not issuing of State’s contribution well before each sowing season hamper implementation of the programme. States would, therefore, ensure issue of States sanction including release of State matching share in time. Inordinate delay/non-utilization of budget may result in non-release of Central share and also diversion of the same to the other performing States.

   As per the guideline**s** of Ministry of Finance, 10% of the Plan budget of NMOOP would be earmarked as flexi-fund to meet the following objective:

   1) To provide flexibility to States to meet local needs and requirement within the overall objective of NMOOP;  
   2) To pilot innovations and improved efficiency within the overall objective of the Scheme and its expected outcomes;  
   3) To undertake mitigation/restoration activities in case of natural calamities in the oilseeds sector.

   Release of flexi-funds would be made on a pro-rata basis along with normal releases of NMOOP. In other words, no separate system for release or for utilization certificate for flexi-funds would be required. Flexi funds will be subject to same audit requirements as the NMOOP including audit by the Comptroller & Auditor General of India (CAG).

   Outcomes and outputs need to be part of MIS alongwith pictures/images and good practices to ensure greater transparency and cross learning across States. Evaluation of flexi-funds would be done through the proposed evaluation process of NMOOP.

   Executive Committee headed by the Agriculture Minister would be empowered for inclusion of additional States.

8. ### **MONITORING, REPORTING & EVALUATION:**

   1. **Monitoring :** National Level Monitoring Teams (NALMOTs) comprising of the technical officers from Department/Crop Development Directorates (CDDs), States’ Department of Agriculture/Horticulture & the scientists of ICAR/SAUs including retired scientists with specialization in the crops concerned would be constituted under the Mission for monitoring of the Mission activities at the field level. The progress of implementation would also be reviewed by the senior officers of the Department during their visits to the states. The overall progress of implementation would be reviewed regularly by the Mission Monitoring Committee. The Standing Committee (SC) and Executive Committee (EC) of the Mission would be apprised of the outcome of the monitoring activities for taking necessary corrective measures, if any. The States would constitute State Level Monitoring Team (SALMOT) at the state level and Project Management Team (PMT) at the district level. The Technical Support Groups would be actively involved in monitoring activities both at National & States level. Monitoring of implementation of the Mission should be as frequent as possible, both at the field level and also through video conferencing**.**

   The Concurrent, Mid-term and Plan End Impact evaluation of the Mission will be undertaken at National level through an agency appointed by GOI. Besides the State Government would also undertake concurrent & impact assessment on year to year basis. A baseline survey will be conducted by the State’s Department of Economic &

   Statistics to ascertain the productivity level of oilseeds prior to implementation of NMOOP. The State Mission Director will also conduct a base line survey in respect of oil palm for productivity of FFB of oil palm at farmer’s field.

   2. **Reporting System:** Information Technology tools developed in collaboration with NIC will be used for monitoring and evaluation of the Mission. States will compile & furnish the physical and financial status on implementation of the Mission through a Web-enabled Monitoring System. The State Mission Director will be responsible for reporting the progress of implementation of the Mission.

      * The States will be allowed to dovetail the resources of other programmes of GOI, wherever required to supplement the efforts of NMOOP. The approved/**existing** committed liability arising out of implementation of ongoing schemes on oilseeds, oil palm and TBOs will be taken over by NMOOP except the liability of the staff. However, in future, implementing agencies would be required to undertake activities only within the allocations approved by GOI & corresponding State share. No claim relating to expenditure over and above approved allocation funds would be entertained in DAC.  
      * Under MM-I on Oilseeds, flexibility will given to the States for inter component diversion of funds up to 20% except seeds components. Inter Component changes in the approved AAPs of the states under MM-II on Oil Palm can only be allowed with the approval of SC of NMOOP.

      * A minimum of 25% of the funds allocated for implementation of beneficiary oriented components viz. planting material, demonstration, training, supply of farm implements including sprinkler/drip irrigation will be earmarked by the State Government for the utilization of the farmers belonging to Schedule Caste (17%) and Schedule Tribe (8%). However, allocation to SC/ST farmers may be made proportionate to their population in the districts by the States.

      * The States will be allowed to cover local initiatives, if any, which may be crucial and not covered as an intervention under NMOOP. The State may include such interventions with subsidy not more than 50% of the cost of the item/services within 1% allocation of AAP under each Mini-Mission per year.

   3. **Evaluation**: A baseline survey will be conducted by the States Mission Directors to ascertain the productivity level of oilseeds under MM-I. Under MM-II, a

   baseline survey for the productivity of oil palm at farmers’ field in each block already harvesting FFBs from earlier plantations will be conducted. Similarly benchmark survey will be made under MM-III for current area and production of TBOs/oils. The respective State Governments will undertake concurrent evaluation on year-to-year basis and the Government of India will undertake a mid-term evaluation at the national level through an independent agency/organization after the 3rd year of implementation of the Mission to assess performance and shortcomings so as to take remedial measures, if any, in the method of implementation. An impact evaluation at the national level will also be undertaken through an independent agency to assess the impact of the mission in increasing the productivity of oilseeds crops under MM-I & overall development under MM-II and MM-III by the end of the Twelfth Plan Period.

9. ### **MISSION INTERVENTIONS:**

   All interventions suitable for integrated farming system depending on the climatic conditions and natural resource base for optimizing farm returns in a sustainable manner have been included under NMOOP. The Mission imbibes the inputs delivery of existing programmes on oilseeds and oil palm and also restructures the interventions by inclusion/deletion and rationalizing the subsidy thereon. The components under Mini Mission-I on Oilseeds, Mini Mission-II on Oil Palm and Mini Mission-III on Tree Borne Oilseeds (TBOs) are described separately.

   1. ### **Mini Mission-I (MM-I) on Oilseeds:**

   The components of the Annual Action Plan (AAP) under MM-I on Oilseeds will be classified broadly in three categories namely Seed Components, Production Components and Transfer of Technology. The illustrative expenditure thereon is as under:

      1. ### **Seed Components:**

   Production of seed is time-consuming, cost intensive and risky under rainfed conditions in which oilseeds are grown. The planning for anticipated requirement of Breeder seeds is done in advance to produce Foundation and Certified seeds in subsequent generations. Therefore, the chain of the quality seeds production begins from Breeders seeds. The high seed volume crops of groundnut and soybean need strategic planning for Breeder seeds production to meet the certified seed requirements. The Central Seed Producing Agencies can also produce the Foundation and Certified seeds in the states, which are not covered under the Mission. The

   popularity of hybrids seeds in sunflower, castor and safflower also require maintenance of parental material and special techniques for hybrids seed production.

         2. ### **Purchase of Breeders seeds / parental lines (hybrid seed)**

   ICAR is the nodal agency for the production of Breeder seeds of oilseeds. The ongoing support for Breeder seed production to ICAR has been discontinued from 2013-14. However, the financial liability accrued on the breeder seed production under ISOPOM upto Eleventh Plan would be considered under the Mission. The breeder seeds are produced by the breeders of the organizations such as ICAR/SAUs/KVKs etc. The Mission will reimburse 100% cost of production of the Breeder seeds/parental lines to Central Seed Producing Agencies at the Government of India level. Department of Agriculture of the State Government will however, reimburse 100% cost of Breeder seeds as per cost norms mentioned in Annexure I (a), for the approved targets included under AAPs of the states, to the agencies like SAUs/KVKs/State Seed Corporation/ Federations etc.

         3. ### **Production of Foundation and Certified seeds**

   Subsidy assistance will be provided limited to Rs. 1000/quintal for all varieties/hybrids released during the last 10 years with additional assistance of Rs.100/qtl on the varieties/hybrids released in the last 5 years. 75% of the subsidy amount is meant for farmers and 25% for the seed producing agencies for meeting expenditure towards certification & production etc. The support will be provided to i) States’ Department of Agriculture (SDAs)/ State Seeds Corporations (SSCs) at State level under AAP of the State and to ii) NSC/SFCI/NAFED/KRIBHCO/ IFFCO / IFFDC/Central Multi-State Cooperatives such as NCCF/ Hindustan Insecticides Limited (HIL) or other agency approved by the Executive Committee as central nodal agency at national level, based on the approved Plan for these agencies at Central level. The support for particular variety/hybrids may be decided by Standing Committee of the Mission.

   ### **9.1.1.4 Distribution of Certified Seeds**

   Assistance @50% of the cost limited to Rs.1200/- per quintal for varieties of oilseeds not older than 10 years. For hybrids, assistance for distribution of certified hybrids seeds @ 50% of the cost limited to Rs. 2500/- per quintal for hybrids of oilseeds not older than 10 years. The support will be provided to i) SDAs / SSCs at State level under AAP of the State and to ii) NSC / SFCI / NAFED / KRIBHCO /

   IFFCO/IFFDC/ HIL / Central Multi-State Cooperatives such as NCCF based on the approved Plan for these agencies at Central level. The support for particular variety/hybrids may be decided by SC of the Mission. SHGs/ FIGs/FPOs/Women groups/Co-operatives etc. could also be involved by the States in distribution of Certified Seeds. Subsidized Certified Seed distribution should be done only through own outlets/dealers of Nodal Agencies subject to a ceiling of 5 ha area per farmer for all crops of oilseeds.

   Subsidy assistance would be available to only such organizations and for such varieties/hybrids whose production, certification and availability is ensured through the website of DAC.

   ### **9.1.1.5. Distribution of Minikit (Varietal Diversification)**

   Minikits are meant for introduction and popularization of latest released/pre- released varieties/hybrids not older than 10 years among the farmers free of cost. NSC/SFCI/NAFED/KRIBHCO/IFFCO/IFFDC/HIL/Central Multi-State Cooperatives such as NCCF/SSCs etc., will be involved in supply of minikits at national level. Allocation will be made @ one minikit for every 20 Ha area under each crop containing 20 kg seed for groundnut, 8 kg seed for soybean, 2 kg seed of each rapeseed & mustard, sunflower, safflower, linseed, castor and one kg seed each of sesame and niger. The price of seed minikits will be fixed by the Mission Monitoring Committee of NMOOP at National level and 100 % cost would be reimbursed to the agencies on certification of receipt by the state.   The allocation of seed minikits will be decided by the Standing Committee before commencement of Kharif/Rabi/Summer seasons.

         6. ### **Seed Infrastructure Development**

   Assistance upto 50% for creation of seed infrastructure including threshing floor, seed storage godowns with the provision for de-humidification, irrigation facilities including tube wells/bore wells, motor pumps, sprinklers, excluding drip, lining of channels, levelling of fields, fencing on the farms, electrification of office building, farm machinery etc at State Government/State Seed Corporation (SSC) farms engaged in seeds/planting material production for the Mission crops and upto 75 % GOI support for farms of NSC/SFCI and 100 % for SAUs/KVKs under Mini Mission-I on Oilseeds. The support for already approved seed infrastructure projects to States/Agencies under ISOPOM during Eleventh Plan period will be continued

   under the Mission. Maximum of 1% of total outlay under the Mini Mission-I of NMOOP for the entire Twelfth Plan period will be utilized for this intervention. The seed infrastructure development proposals of Department of Agriculture of the State Government must be sent by the respective Mission Directors to DAC separately supported by estimates and construction plans as per the latest schedule of rates of State PWD. This component will not be implemented without the prior and specific approval of the Standing Committee of NMOOP.

         7. ### **Variety Specific Targeted Seed Production (VSTSP)**

   In order to ensure availability of quality seeds of a particularly variety of oilseeds for large area cultivation the seeds are required to be multiplied on large scale for distribution to the farmers. Therefore, a provision has been made to undertake seed production of varieties/hybrids not older than 5 years under VSTSP component of the Mission. The production of hybrids on large scale could also be taken provided sufficient parental material is available. VSTSP will provide 75% support to NSC/SFCI/selected SSCs/State Government Agencies/ICAR/SAU and KVK farms etc in a project mode. The certified seed produced under VSTSP will be utilized under Distribution of Seed Minikit component through the Departments of Agriculture of the State Government for distribution to the farmers.

      2. ### **Production Inputs:**

   The support for other non-seed components input will be provided to the farmers through the Department of Agriculture of the State Governments.

         1. ### **Plant Protection Equipments**/**eco friendly light-trap (NCIPM Model)**

   For manual sprayers: Knapsack**/**foot operated sprayers, eco friendly light trap (NCIPM), @ 40% of the cost of procurement subject to a ceiling of Rs. 600/- per equipment (additional 10% assistance to SC / ST / Small / Marginal Farmers / Women, Groups \>5 members FPOs and NE States to a ceiling of Rs. 800/- per unit). Seed treating drum with a capacity of 20 kg and 40 kg @ 50% assistance subject to ceiling of Rs. 1750/- and 2000/- per unit respectively.

   For Knapsack and Taiwan power sprayers (capacity below 16 litres) @ 50% of the cost of procurement subject to a ceiling of Rs. 3000/- per unit (additional 10%

   assistance to SC / ST / Small / Marginal Farmers / Women, Groups \>5 members FPOs and NE States to a ceiling of Rs.3800/- per unit).

   For Knapsack and Taiwan   power sprayers (capacity above 16 litres) @ 40% of the cost of procurement subject to a ceiling of Rs. 8000/- per unit (additional 10% assistance to SC / ST / Small / Marginal Farmers / Women, Groups \>5 members FPOs and NE States to a ceiling of Rs. 10000/- per unit).

         2. ### 	**Plant Protection Chemicals/ insecticides/ fungicides/ Bio-pesticides/ Weedicides/ Bio-agents/ micronutrients etc**

   Need based supply of PP chemicals, insecticides, fungicides, bio-pesticides, weedicides, bio-agents, micronutrients etc. to the farmers will be supported @ 50% of the cost limited to Rs 500/- ha.

         3. ### **Distribution of gypsum/pyrite/liming/dolomite/Single Super Phosphate etc. (SSP)**

   For proper plant growth and seed setting with higher oil content, it is essential to use balanced application of fertilizers with organic manure and application of micro-nutrients**.** Deficiencies of secondary nutrients like calcium and Sulphur in groundnut, Sulphur in other oilseeds adversely impact productivity of oilseeds. Similarly in upland areas, soil acidity and in low lying alkalinity/salinity adversely affects growth and yield of oilseeds crops. Assistance has therefore been provisioned under NMOOP for supply of gypsum/pyrite/liming/ dolomite/SSP, etc., to the farmers.
