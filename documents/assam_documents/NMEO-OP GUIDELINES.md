**OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES OF NATIONAL MISSION ON EDIBLE OILS-OIL PALM (NMEO-OP) (2021-22 to 2025-26)**

# CURRENT STATUS OF EDIBLE OIL PRODUCTION

*   1.  India is dependent on imports to meet its edible oil requirements and is the largest importer of edible oils in the world. During 2020-21, India imported around 133.52 lakh tonnes of edible oils costing around ₹ 80,000 crore. Out of all the imported edible oils, the share of palm oil is about 56%, followed by soybean oil at 27%, and sunflower at 16%. Domestic edible oil production has not been able to keep pace with the growth in consumption which is above 25 million tonnes. The per capita consumption which was 15.8 kg per person per annum in 2012-13 has increased to around 19.00 kg at present. During 2020-21, the domestic production of edible oils was 122.89 lakh tonnes. The year wise production, import and export along with consumption of edible oils in the country is given in Table 1:

# OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

*   1.  Oil Palm (_Elaeis guineensis_), which originated from West Africa is comparatively a new crop in India and has highest vegetable oil yielding capability per ha. It produces two distinct oils, _i.e._ palm oil and palm kernel oil, which are used for culinary as well as industrial purposes. Palm oil is derived from the fleshy mesocarp of the fruit, which contains about 45-55% of oil. Palm kernel oil, obtained from the kernel of oil palm, is the source of lauric oils. With quality planting material, irrigation and proper management, oil palm has the potential to produce 20-25 MT fresh fruit bunches (FFBs) per ha after attaining the age of 8- 9 years. In comparative terms the yield of palm oil is 5 times the yield of edible oil obtainable from traditional oilseeds.
    2.  Government of India has continuously been making efforts to increase the area production of oil palm. For increased availability of edible oils in the country and to reduce the import burden, various interventions since 1991-92 through schemes such as the Technology Mission on Oilseed & Pulses (TMOP), Integrated Scheme on Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil Palm and Maize (ISOPOM), Oil Palm Area Expansion (OPAE), National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP) and the National Food Security Mission (NFSM)–Oilseeds & Oil Palm were under implementation in 13 States _viz_; Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Gujarat, Karnataka, Odisha, Mizoram, Nagaland, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur with the funding pattern of 60:40 in case of general States and 90:10 in case of North-Eastern States and hill States.
    3.  As a result of the developmental efforts over the years, the oil palm area which was 8585 ha in 1991-92, has increased to 3.70 lakh ha in 2020-21. Similarly, the production of Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFBs) from which oil palm is extracted, has increased from 0.21 lakh tonnes to 16.89 lakh tonnes in 2020-21. Crude Palm Oil (CPO) has increased from 0.01 lakh tonnes to 2.72 lakh tonnes during the same period.

# OIL PALM GROWING STATES

*   1.  Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala are the major Oil palm growing States and account for 98% of the total production. Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Gujarat and Mizoram also have a sizable area under Oil palm cultivation. Recently Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Nagaland have also initiated Oil palm plantation programmes.
    2.  Oil palm cultivation takes place in the States based on a catchment area allocated by the State Government to the Oil palm processors/industry. The prices for FFBs are either governed through the Oil Palm Acts of the State Governments, or through Regulations and Orders. The reasons behind the slow pace of development of oil palm in India are manifold, the most significant being the lack of assured price for the FFBs for the oil palm farmers and the uncertainty in the payment of price of FFBs since it is linked to the landed CPO price which is prone to major fluctuations in the payment. Further, there was no support from the Government of India for the FFB price to the farmer.

# ASSESSMENT OF OIL PALM POTENTIAL ARERA IN INDIA

*   1.  The reassessment committee of ICAR- Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research (IIOPR) 2020 has assessed in the year 2020, a total area of around 28 lakh hectares fit for oil palm cultivation in India. Out of the total 27.99 lakh ha potential area, an area of 18.37 lakh is in the general states, and 9.62 lakh in the NE States. Presently in the North East the coverage is around 38,992 hectares against the potential of 9.62 lakh hectares, leaving much scope for expansion. During 2020-21, the production of CPO was around 2.72 lakh tonnes, obtained from 1.87 lakh hectares of fruiting area.

# Potential Area and Area Coverage under Oil Palm in India

The state-wise potential area assessed by ICAR-IIOPR in 2020 and coverage up to March 2020 is given in **Annexure I.**

# NATIONAL MISSION ON EDIBLE OILS- OIL PALM (NMEO-OP)

*   1.  Considering the growing domestic demand for edible oils, the staggering deficiency and the cost to the exchequer on account of imports, the urgency of scaling up the oil palm area is of national interest and does not need any over emphasis. Therefore, to fulfil the national interest, **National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)** has been launched with the aim to enhance the edible oilseeds production and oils availability in the country by harnessing Oil Palm area expansion, increasing CPO production and to reduce import burden on edible oils. The State Department of Agriculture, State Department of Horticulture, Central University, ICAR- Institutions, CDDs, SAUs, KVKs, Central Agencies/Cooperatives, Oil palm processors/ Associations, DD Kisan etc will be the implementing stake holders of the NMEO-Oil palm.

# TARGET OF NMEO-OP:

*   1.  Around 9 million tonnes of palm oil is imported every year which is around 56 % of the total imports of edible oil.
    2.  The target fixed for Oil palm area expansion by 2025-26 under NMEO-Oil palm is as under:
        *   To increase area of oil palm to 10 lakh hectares from 3.5 lakh ha during 2019-20 by 2025-26 (additional 6.50 lakh ha). The target for general states is 3.22 lakh hectares and 3.28 lakh ha for North Eastern states, with targeted FFB production of 66.00 lakh tonnes.
        *   To increase in Crude Palm Oil production from 0.27 lakh tonnes during 2019-20 to 11.20lakh tonnes by 2025-26 and 28 lakh tonnes by 2028-29.
        *   Increase consumer awareness to maintain consumption level of 19.00 kg/person/annum till 2025-26. The state wise area expansion target for General and NE states is given in **Annexure- II**

\* Target proposed for area expansion in provision/tentative which may increase/decrease based or the proposal for Area expansion from the State/UTs.

# STRATEGY

*   1.  The strategy to implement NMEO-OP will include increasing production of seedlings by establishment of seed gardens and nurseries of oil palm to assure domestic availability of seedlings as per target fixed under NMEO-OP. Improving productivity of FFBs, increasing drip irrigation coverage under oil palm, diversification of area from low yielding cereals crops to oil palm, inter- cropping during gestation period of 4 years, would provide economic return to the farmerswhen there is no production.

The scheme would be implemented in a mission mode through active involvement of all the stakeholders. Fund flow would be monitored to ensure that benefit of the Mission reaches the targeted beneficiaries in time to achieve the targeted results.

# FUNDING PATTERN & FUND FLOW:

*   1.  NMEO-OP is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the cost will be shared as 60:40 between the Central and the State Government for General states and 90:10 for NE states and 100% for UTs and for central agencies. As per ICAR-IIOPR Report 2020, oil palm can be cultivated in 20 states covering 284 districts. All the potential states and districts identified by ICAR- IIOPR will be under NMEO-OP including NE states and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Further, if States identify other districts suitable for cultivation, they will also be considered.

**9.1.2** However, the potential districts having more than 4000 to 5000 ha will be given special focus for oil palm area expansion and productivity enhancement of FFBs. The State Governments will develop long- term agreement between farmers, processors and states through the Oil Palm Act or any other mechanism prevalent in the state. They will also involve industries, ICAR, KVKs in the formulation, prioritization of activities & identification of beneficiaries at grass root level and ensure involvement of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) . The assistance will be provided for water harvesting & irrigation through PRI and the details o fassistance is given as **Annexure-III.**

*   1.  The Department of Agriculture/Horticulture of the State Governments will be the Nodal agency for undertaking area expansion programme of Oil Palm in their States under NMEO-OP with close partnership with Processors. The funding pattern is 60:40 in case of general category States and 90:10 in case of North-Eastern states between Central and State Governments in all components except R&D projects, seed gardens, nurseries and viability gap payment (100% GOI share). ICAR, CDDs/CAU/SAU will be associated on 100% funding basis. The allocation of funds to the States would be made on the basis of their Annual Action Plan (AAP). For UTs it will be 100% funding for all components.
    2.  The states will involve processors/associations as per tripartite agreement for the implementation of the oil palm scheme in the state. The processors are also eligible for setting up of seed gardens and nurseries, distribution of planting material etc. The processors will submit their oil palm area expansion target and component wise AAP to the State for its inclusion in the AAP of the state, approved by SLSC.
    3.  The states will nominate Mission Directors of NMEO-OP under the Chairmanship of Secretary Agriculture/ Horticulture. The annual action plan of NMEO-OP of each state has to be approved by State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) headed by the Chief Secretary.
    4.  The funds will be released to the State Departments of Agriculture/Horticulture through their respective State Governments. DBT will be used for transfer of funds to the State /Agencies/ Farmers/Processors/SAUs. The private sector and NGOs could be involved through the State Department of Agriculture, Horticulture & ICAR.

**9.5.1** The Government of India will release the funds to the agencies for the 100% funded components/activities at Central level. The oil palm development programme of NFSM (OP) along with committed liability of the approved programme of 2020-21 and 2021-22 will be subsumed under the NMEO-OP. No permanent posts will be created by the Central or the

State Governments under NMEO- OP.

*   1.  Release of Central and States’ share for this scheme will be through **an escrow account** mechanism. Both the GoI and State share of funds shall be transferred to the escrow account. The Secretary, Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare would be authorized to release up to two instalments of 25% each to States without insisting on release of State’s share. A Tripartite Agreement between Centre, State and the Bank would be signed for this purpose Annexure-XIV
    2.  Majority of the interventions of NMEO-OP are beneficiary oriented. The resources for Schedule Caste (17%) and Schedule Tribe (8%) will be earmarked for utilization under all the components of NMEO. However, states will be allowed to make allocation to SC/ST farmers proportionate to their population in the States/Districts. In addition, adoption of cluster approach is advocated for ensuring the participation of all farmers belonging to small/marginal, SC/ST/Minority/Women categories in a cluster. No area restriction is applicable for individual farmers for availing subsidy/ intervention.

# ROLE OF PANCHAYATI RAJ INSTITUTIONS:

*   1.  The State Governments may develop a sound mechanism for involvement of PRIs in the formulation, prioritization of activities & identification of beneficiaries at grass root level and ensure involvement of NGOs, Self Help Groups and Private companies for the following activities:
*   Selection of beneficiary for oil palm plantation
*   Identification and mapping of priority areas / activity mapping for the implementation of Mission interventions
*   Capacity Building of PRI Officials
*   Implementation of Local Initiatives in the identified districts.
*   Liaising with processors, state officials and SAUs
*   Involving NGOs/SHGs/Private companies (Active/renowned)
*   Member of the district level officers from cooperative
    1.  Gazette Notification for implementation of **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)** will be notified for NMEO-Oil palm. The DBT would be implemented to transfer NMEO-oil palm funds for identified interventions to all beneficiaries. The details of data bank related to beneficiaries would be uploaded to MIS of respective portals. The states and central agencies are therefore liable to make the beneficiaries entries in the National DBT portal of DA&FW.

# AREA OF OPERATION:

12.1 NMEO-OP will be implemented in the various States as per recommendation of IIOPR Report or State recommendation. NMEO-GC headed by Hon’ble Agriculture Minister would be

empowered for inclusion of additional potential States/districts with consultation of ICAR/ IIOPR in addition to t h e identified areas as per t h e Report of IIOPR, 2020. F o r NMEO- OP: Potential states and districts are of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andaman & Nicobar islands.

# MONITORING, REPORTING & EVALUATION:

*   1.  **Monitoring :** National Level Monitoring Teams (NALMOTs) comprising of the technical officers from Department/Crop Development Directorates (CDDs), States Departments of Agriculture/Horticulture & the scientists of ICAR/SAUs including retired scientists with specialization in the crops concerned will be constituted under the Mission for field monitoring of the Missionactivities by DA&FW. The progress of implementation would also be reviewed by the senior officers of the Department during their visits to the states concerned. The overall progress of implementation would be reviewed regularly by the Executive Committee (EC), and General Council (GC) of the Mission would be apprised of the consolidated outcome of monitoring activities for taking necessary corrective measures, if any. The States would constitute State Level Monitoring Team (SALMOT) at State level and Project Management Team (PMT) at district level. The Technical Support Groups would be actively involved in monitoring activities both at National & States level. Information Communication Technology (ICTs) tools like, mobile App, Video Conferences would also be utilized for facilitating interactions on implementation & monitoring, reporting and evaluation. Specialized software for the reporting, monitoring and evaluation reflecting the details of benefit extended to the individual beneficiaries will be developed through NIC. Updation of records/progress is the responsibility of the state government and the state will develop systems for seamless transfer of data to the Central Government on a monthly basis.
    2.  The concurrent, mid-term after 24-30 months and plan end (2025-26) impact evaluation of the Mission will be undertaken at National level through e-procurement and e- tendering as per GFR guidelines. An evaluation will also be undertaken during the third year of the implementation to assess the impact of NMEO-OP. Besides the State Government would also undertake concurrent & impact assessment on a year to year basis. A district wise baseline survey will be conducted by the Joint committee of State Department of Economic & Statistics, Department of Agriculture/Horticulture & Department of Revenue at the ground level to ascertain the target area, and existing productivity level of oil palm prior to inception to NMEO- Oil palm. This will be conducted by the State Mission Director at farmer’s fields.
    3.  **Reporting System:** Separate websites and information technology tools developed in collaboration with NIC will be used for monitoring and evaluation of the mission. States and implementing agencies will compile & furnish the physical and financial status on implementation ofthe Mission through a Web-enabled Monitoring System. The State Mission Director will be responsible for reporting the progress of implementation of the Mission and will update the progress each month. The Central Government too will operate a separate website for the purpose in which seamless flow of data will flow from the states.
    4.  The States will be allowed to dovetail the resources with other programmes of GoI, wherever required to supplement the efforts of NMEO-OP. Complementary support / services

extended under the existing schemes of DA&FW such as RKVY, PMKSY, SMAM, MIDH will be dovetailed with the approved programme through a mechanism of inter-division consultations at different levels viz GOI, State Government and Districts to ensure delivery of comprehensive package of services without duplication to meet the desired targets of NMEO- OP . There will be convergence with Ministry of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj at the National level.

*   1.  Under NMEO-OP, flexibility will be given to the States for inter component diversion of funds up to 10% except seedlings, intercropping and maintenance components. Inter Component changes in the approved AAPs of the states under NMEO-OP can only be allowed with the approval of NMEO-OP-EC. Small, marginal, SC/ST and women farmers involved in cultivation of Oil Palm will be given priority for providing benefits and support under Mission.
    2.  The States will be allowed to cover local initiatives which may be crucial and not covered as an intervention under NMEO-OP. The State may include such interventions with subsidy not more than 50% of the cost of the item/services. The format for monthly, quarterly and yearly progress report along with the submission of Annual Action Plan is annexed (**Annexure IVa&b and Annexure V**)..

# INTERVENTIONS OF NMEO – OP

*   1.  The present guidelines are applicable to NMEO- OP for its implementation from 2021-22 to 2025- 26, but will be subject to corrections after review of scheme as mentioned above. The NMEO-OP will cover all aspects of oil palm promotion having long term agreement with Farmers, Processors, States, Plantation & re-plantation support, FFBs price fixation, payment of viability gap of FFBs to the farmers, special package for North East states _etc_. On the basis of the current needs, the various components of existing NFSM (OP) have been modified with increased assistance. The details of pattern of assistance under NMEO- OP is given in **Annexure-VI.**

# SUPPLY OF PLANTING MATERIAL

*   1.  Quality of planting materials coupled with proper management practices used greatly determines the enhanced productivity and higher production of FFBs. Assistance will be provided to the farmers through the State Department of Agriculture/Horticulture/ Oil palm processors for purchasing of planting material @ Rs. 20,000/ha for domestic seedlings and Rs. 29,000/ha for imported seedlings (at the rate of 150 plants per ha) for the entire land holding and planting area of the farmer. The performance of seed gardens & seed museums will be reviewed periodically by the Oilseeds Division of DA&FW. The assistance for imported sprouted seed/ planting material involves following expenses:
*   **Non recurring expenses:** Sprout cost, Sprout transport &handling charges, Poly bag, Red Earth, Sand, FYM, Neem cake, Layout & bag filling,Nursery Establishment, _etc_.
*   **Recurring expenses:** Fertilizers, Pesticides, Electricity, Diesel, Repair & Maintenance Labour. Overheads and administrative expenses, _etc_.
    1.  The planting material is more crucial in oil palm as the crop is perennial giving economic yields up to nearly 30 years. The base mother palms are from Thodupuzha in Kerala which are moderate yielders in terms of Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFBs). Selection was done for mother palms

having high FFB yield combined with more oil in mesocarp of the fruit, i.e., higher oil yield. Through repeated crossing and selection for a period of three decades, India has achieved a stage of third generation material with 15-20% improvement in FFB yield, and 5-6 tonnes of oil/ha/year.

*   1.  Government of India has taken an ambitious target to cover 6.5 lakh ha in next 5 years from current area for which huge quantities of seedlings are required. As per the target, total seedlings requirement could be 975 lakh numbers in the next 5 years. The permission of import of germinated seed/ seedling/planting material could be allowed with NOC for non availability of domestically produced sprouted seed/planting material from IIOPR or concerned State Govt. Import of Oil Palm sprouts take 7 months from placing of order and 12 months for quarantine. The sprouts are placed in a primary nursery for 3 months and a secondary nursery for 9 months to attain 3- 4 leaf stage. Therefore, the import of seedlings should be linked with actual plantation. The respective State Government may identify the districts wise 5 year advance area coverage planning for planning the year wise requirement of Oil Palm seedlings. A monitoring mechanism needs to be developed to monitor the permission granted for import and actual imported seedlings by the processor/State govt. The domestically produced seedling needs to be increased periodically and reduce imported seedling in phase manner. The requirement of seedling as per the provisional target of year wise/ state wise is tabulated below. However, year wise seed requirement may vary from year to year depending on the proposal for area expansion received from the States and approval granted by the competent authority.

The Plant Protection Division, DA&FW will be responsible for checking the quarantine requirements etc. necessary for the imported material.

# MAINTENANCE AND INTERCROPPING DURING GESTATION PERIOD

*   1.  Support will be provided to the farmers for inputs of inter-crops and the concept of integrated farming will be incorporated during gestation period for entire land holding / plantation area for purchase of seeds/ fertilizers/ INM/ IPM/ fertigation/ tree guards and PP chemicals etc. During gestation period of 4 years, assistance for maintenance to the farmers will be given @ 50% of the cost limited to Rs. 50,000/ha (Rs. 6,250/ha per year for Maintenance and Rs. 6,250/ha per year for Inter-cropping) in NE/A& N Islands & Rs. 42,000/ha (Rs. 5,250/ha per year for Maintenance and Rs. 5,250/ha per year for Inter- cropping) for General States. The cost of maintenance & intercropping involves the following items:
*   **Fertilizers, Organic Manure & Pesticide:** Fertilizers, Fertilizer application, OrganicManure, Manure application, Plant Protection, PP application, _etc._
*   **Other inputs** : Land preparation, Layout, pitting, planting, Basin preparation, Weed management, Repair & maintenance and Misc. expenses, _etc._
    1.  Oil Palm starts producing Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFBs) after 3-4 years of its plantation and therefore, it becomes essential to maintain the plantation for 4 years through irrigation, fertilizer, intercultural operations, insect pest control, basin making, fencing _etc_. Growing of intercrops in oil palm such as cocoa, red ginger, heliconia, bush pepper, banana and ornamental crops would support the farmers during the initial non productive period of 4 years. This along with integrated farming should be converged.

# REPLANTING OF OLD GARDEN

Oil palm has an economic life span of around 30 years. The plantations made during 1991-92 have become more than 30 years old which need immediate replanting. Similarly, every year old plantation of 25- 30 years need to be replanted to maintain the overall planting area. Replanting involves uprooting of tree, removing of tree from the field and digging of new pits, all of which are labor consuming activities. A new component of Rs. 250 per plant assistance has been provided for the purpose. The assistance for planting materials for replanting may be obtained separately in addition to the planting material components.

# 29\. Viability Price, Formula Price, Viability Gap Payment & FFBs Price fixation (Annexure XIII)

1.  **Viability Price for price of FFBs as assured returns to the farmers**
    1.  Since India remains heavily dependent on imports, international CPO prices will continue to affect the prices of domestic FFBs. Hence it is necessary to insulate the farmers from this volatility in prices. Thus a new mechanism has been formulated in the interest of the farmers to ensure their remunerative returns to build up their confidence to undertake Oil Palm plantation.
    2.  A **Viability price (VP) for the price of FFBs has been introduced ,** which will be the mechanism for the assured returns to the farmers, to take care of the fluctuations, and will guarantee a price for their produce with an objective formulation.
    3.  For assurance to the farmers for the prices of FFBs during the Oil Palm Year (OPY), which is from 1st November till 31st October for next year, the Viability Price (VP) shall be declared in November of each year. **This VP of FFB per ton shall be 14.3% of the annual average price of CPO of the last 5 years adjusted with wholesale price index (WPI) of all India.** Every year starting with OPY from the month of 1st November, the Government of India shall declare

the VP for that OPY by a committee of the Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. Through declaration of this VP, the farmers will know at the beginning of the year the price they will be paid for their produce of FFBs.

1.  **Formula Price (FP):**
2.  For the assured payment to the farmers, a concept of formula price has been introduced. **The simpler formula is, FFB price = 14.3% of CPO price**. **This will replace the CACP Formula of 2012**. The FP will be average monthly (of the preceding month) landed CPO price multiplied by a multiplication factor 14.30%, as applicable in case of the Viability Price. **The Formula price would be used only for the calculation of viability gap funding calculation in every month**.
3.  Though the calculation of 14.3 % has been taken for the calculation of FFB price for conversion from the CPO price, but for a PAN India scheme, **CPO price for this scheme will be the CPO price for Kandla delivery traded on Multi Commodity Exchange India (MCX), moderated on a lower side by 1.5 %.**
4.  **Viability Gap Payment (VGP):**

The Industry pays the farmers for their FFB produce based on the monthly prices fixed for the FFBs. **If the payment to farmers by the industry is below the VP, the Government will provide a VGP to ensure that the farmers payment reaches the VP**. In this scenario, the farmer would be entitled for payment of VGP, which **shall be the VP for the Oil Palm Year (OPY) minus the Formula price (FP) for that particular month, in case the farmers payment by the industry is less then VP. The VGP** from, 1st Nov, 2021 to 31st Oct, 2028, shall be 100% difference between the VP and the FP price for a particular month. Thereafter, every 3 years (1st Nov, 2028 to 31st Oct, 2031; 1st Nov, 2031 to 31st Oct, 2034 and 1st Nov, 2034 to 31st Oct, 2037), will decrease by 25 % to reach landed CPO price in 2037. **There will be no VGP liability for the Government from 1st November 2037.**

1.  **Industry Payment in Rest of India , NER and Andaman & Nicobar Islands :**
2.  While for the calculation of FP, a constant of 14.3 % of CPO has been taken, for the minimum industry payment to the farmers, this will increase gradually. Industry will pay based on 14.3% of the average monthly price of CPO from 1st November 2021 to 31stOctober 2028. This payment by the industry shall increase by 0.25 % every three years from 1st November 2028, till 31st October2037 to reach 15.3 % on 1st November 2037. From 1st November 2037, the farmers will be paid 15.3 % of CPO as FFB Price. Details of the CPO price traded at Kandla Exchange will be provided by the Government of India through a portal and will be shared to the state governments on a daily/monthly basis.
3.  To give impetus to the North East (NE) and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (A&N Islands), specially because of the existing terrain, tough conditions and need for investment in the industry, Government of India will provide a special payment for NER and A&N Islands, to ensure that the farmers are paid at par with the rest of India
4.  Presently through the Oil Palm Acts/ Regulations/Orders, State Governments are fixing the price for the FFBs which is paid by the industry to the farmers. In case States do not adopt the industry payment as per this scheme, they shall be at liberty to continue with their own payment system, and in

such a case the industrywill be mandated to pay the State mandated price. **In case States do not adopt the industry payment pattern of the scheme, then industry shall pay the state mandated price and in such a case, neither VGF or special NE payment shall be payable by GoI. Thus the payment of VGF or special NER payment by GOI shall be applicable only if the states adopt the formulation of payment of FFB price of the scheme. For this the states adopting the approved scheme payment pattern by the industry will sign a memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) with the Government of India for the same. A sample of the MoU is at Annexure XVI.** The payment by Government of India & the Industry as mentioned above has been summarized in the table below.

Payment pattern of the scheme, the payment by GoI and Industry as per the MoU:

| Oil Year | Minimum Payment schedule by industry to farmers (as % of CPO) | Difference to be paid by GoI to the farmers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rest of India | N Estates &A & N Islands | Difference to be paid byGOI in North East states&(A&N)Islandsfor parity with ROI | Payment of VGP by GOI tofarmers as(Viability price-Formula price) |
| 1st Nov21to 31st Oct 28 | 14.30 | 12.30 | 14.30-12.30=2% | (Viability price-Formula price)x 100% |

_\* Subject to the condition that together with industry payment and NER and A&N Islands specialpayment by GOI, it does not exceed the viability price declared by the GOI._

Though the funding for the approved NMEO (OP) for five years has been kept till 2025-26, since the sunset clause will be from November, 2037, thus the Government of India liabilities would continue till that time for the scheme as applicable. The farmers already cultivating oil palm would also be considered for VGF along with future growers of oil palm so that the confidence in the farmers is enhanced to go for oil palm cultivation.

# Details of Seed Gardens with cost norm

1.  **Basics for establishment of seed garden:** Oil palm classified into three types of palms based on its fruit types, thick shelled _dura_, shell less _pisifera_ and thin shelled _tenera_ which isa cross between dura and pisifera. Oil palm dura used as a mother palm having dominant genotype sh+sh+, carries fruits with a thick shell and a thin mesocarp. For establishing an oil palm seed garden it is recommended to have 40 acres of land (30 acres for planting of _dura_ (mother palms) block and 10 acres for TxT (pollen parent) block). Accordingly, the DPR has been prepared for 40 acres (14+2 ha) of land. Requirement of planting material for the approved seed garden in 40 acres is 2400 seedlings. About 150 seedlings with a provision of7 seedlings for gap filling are required for each hectare of planting. To get 150 seedlingsready for field planting, it is better to raise 200 nos. of germinated seed (sprouts) in the primary nursery. However, ICAR-IIOPR, Pedavegi would be supplying the seedlings (both _Dura_and TxT) on payment basis (at present cost of seedling is Rs.1200/- per seedling +GST) as secondary stage nursery seedlings. Requirement of seedlings along with payment may be informed at least 18- 24 months in advance as the availability of quality germinated seeds is subjected to several factors.

**Nursery Management:** If germinated seeds are procured, then two stage nursery system should be followed. For rising the sprouts in the nursery, please refer to our technical bulletin on ‘Nursery Management in Oil Palm’ which will give complete details of nursery

**Planting the seedlings in main field:** Healthy seedlings of 12 months of age, with a minimum of 13-14 functional leaves and having a girth of approximately 25 cm should be field planted. Regular method of planting, equilateral triangular system with 9m x 9m x 9m spacing accommodating 143 palms per ha is recommended for oil palm seed garden. Plantingshould be preferably done during the monsoon and can go till the onset of summer. At the time of planting, 2 baskets (25 kg) of organic manure, 400g of SSP or 250g DAP and 50g of phorate granules can be applied. The gap in the pit should be filled with the soil and pressed firmly leaving top portion, so that the seedling bole will be 25 cm below the ground level. Soon after planting, form a basin around the plant and give copious irrigation. Recommended package of practices for basin, Irrigation, fertilizer and weed management should follow. In a seed garden, it’s not advised to go for intercrops

# Hybridization

**Selection of parents:** To understand the individual palm with respect to morphological, phenological and yield related traits, it is suggested to go for recording of data on sex ratio, vegetative (number of leaves, height, girth, etc), reproductive growth (male, female, hermaphrodite flowers), yield (number & weight of bunches) from 4th year onwards. The entire process is normally called as recording of annual biometric observations. This will be done on quarterly and annually, till the selection of mother palms are completed. The bunch production gradually increases from 4th to 8th year (pre-stabilizing period). From 8th year, it is expected that the yield is stabilized, hence, data on the performance of the palms during these years should be analysed and utilised for selection of mother palms.

Data from 6th to 8th year may be used to start the process of tentative selection of parents and thereby early hybridization could be possible. The process of selecting parents especially mother palms should be continued every year even after 8th year of selection.

**Bunch analysis procedure in oil palm:** Mainly two types of oils extracted commercially from oil palm fruits, crude palm oil (CPO) from mesocarp and palm kernel oil (PKO) from kernel. Bunch (FFB) analysis in oil palm is essential for evaluation of a palm or genotype for its oil yield. Oil palm being a cross pollinated crop, performance of individual palm varies from each other and hence, assessment of individual palm is utmost important.

**Selection standards of parent palms for commercial D x P seed production**

Requirements differ depending on the type of materials used and source of parent palms for commercial DxP seed production. Material of both unknown pedigree and performance should not be used for commercial DxP seed production. The bunch parameters especially oil to mesocarp, kernel to mesocarp and oil to bunch are to be estimated by bunch analysis procedure. With respect to planting materials of both known pedigree and performance the following criteria may be followed for selection of parent palms.

# The minimum standards required for the Dura parent palms are:

*   Fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yield, min : 200 kg/palm/year
*   Mesocarp to fruit (MF), min : 60-80 %

# Total Cost of Expenditure (A+B+C) = 100.00 lakhs

The expenditure is calculated for a well maintained and managed oil palm seed garden by considering all crop growing factors as normal. The returns are projected based on the current market price and demand. The expenditure may further reduce by using molecular assisted technology for fruit form identification

1.  **Basics of the oil palm seedlings in nursery :**Oil palm (_Elaeis guineensis_ Jacq) is mainly propagated by seedlings which are raised in double stage nursery for 12 months _i.e_., primary stage with 4 months under shade net structure and secondary stage for 8 months in open condition. The main source of the planting material in oil palm is seed sprouts which are produced either indigenously or directly imported from other countries. Direct planting of germinated oil palm seeds in the field is not recommended for the fear of insect/rodent damage and lack of genetically uniform stand subsequently. So, the nursery is inevitable in oil palm as it lays the foundation for successful and fruitful plantations in the country.

The main objective of nursery is to produce vigorous and healthy seedlings having the potential for higher yield. There is a great need for intensive care during the nursery period to have maximum growth as leaf area of the seedlings is directly related with fresh fruit bunch yield in plantation. So, any shortcoming in planting material and improper care during the nursery may lead to unproductive or under productive palms in farmers’ plantations. Therefore, production of superior quality seedlings mainly depends on planting of good quality seed sprouts, proper nursery management and finally effective roughing/culling of abnormal seedlings.

# Cost components used for estimation of cost of oil palm nursery.

The following are the components used for estimation of cost for raising oil palm nursery for

12 months duration. Cost components or parameters are broadly categorized into basicmaterials, fixed/establishment cost and variable/recurring cost.

# Basic materials/consumables

**Planting material**: Germinated oil palm seed sprouts either indigenous or imported ones are used for raising nursery. Actual cost of sprouts and transport charges are to be included for indigenous seed sprouts while for imported seed sprouts, import duty and handling charges can be taken into account. Five per cent extra seed sprout supply has to be taken into accountwhile estimating the cost.

**Growing medium**: Combination of tank silt and any organic manure is mainly used as growing medium. In addition, neem cake needs to be added to the medium for controlling incidence of soil borne pests. Cost includes price of soil, organic manure/compost, neem cake and their quantity, loading and transport charges.

**Polythene bags**: Low cost recycled black coloured poly ethylene bags are used. Price of polythene bags and transport charge can be taken into account for cost calculation.

**Inorganic fertilizers**: Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), NPK (17:17:17/19:19:19) complex fertilizers are normally used for 10 months _i.e_., from 2nd to 11th month. Cost includes type of fertilizers, quantity, price of fertilizers and handling charges. Application of Mg SO4 and borax is need based.

**Pesticides**: Normally recommended insecticides, fungicides and herbicides are used for controlling diseases and insect pests and weeds in the nursery. Type of pesticides, quantity, price of pesticides and their transport charges have to be included in cost calculation.

**Mulching material**: Oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) fibre, saw dust, rice husk, coconut fibre and dry grass can be used for mulching in bags during the secondary stage of nursery. Cost includes type of mulch, quantity, price of mulch and transport charges.

**Fuel for generator**: Here, cost includes price of diesel, quantity and transport charges.

# B. Fixed/establishment cost components

**Land preparation, lay out and roads/paths**: Charges for land preparation by removing trees, bushes and weeds, ploughing and leveling of the land by engaging tractor, dividing of area into different blocks and laying of approach roads or paths for the movement of vehicles and nursery staff can be accounted and the amount spent on this should be equally distributedover 10 years and only cost per annum can be included in estimation.

**Irrigation system**: Cost includes installation of sprinkler/drip system of irrigation in an area of

13.5 acres. Life of the irrigation system can be taken for 10 years, so expenditure on irrigation system can be distributed equally over 10 years.

**Shadenet house/pandal**: Shadenet house or pandal is required for raising oil palm seedlings during the primary stage of nursery and 1500m2 area is needed for raising one lakh seedlings. Life of shadenet pandal should be taken as 10 years and the amount spent on this structure can be distributed over 10 years.

**Motor, electrical fittings and water pumping system**: Price of electric motor, cabling, electric panel board and rain proof shelter for panel board, water filtration unit _etc_ have to be considered for cost calculation. Life of above items can be taken as 10 years and money can be distributed equally for 10 years.

**Office room cum storage shed**: Low cost or semi permanent shed is required for staying nursery staff, resting of casual workers, keeping of nursery tools and appliances, temporary storage of fertilizers, pesticides, fuel etc. Money spent on construction of the shed and life

(10yrs) of the structure has to be taken into account for cost estimation.

**Security cabin and gate**: Here, cost includes amount spent on making of semi permanent security cabin and fixing of gate.

**Generator/solar power pump set**: Generator/solar power pump set is compulsory to meet water demand of oil palm nursery as nurseries are located in rural areas/isolated places, frequent power cuts and change in timings of power supply. Life of generator/solar pump set can be taken as 10 years and cost of it can be distributed equally over 10 years.

# C. Variable/recurring cost components

**Nursery operations**: Quality of oil palm seedlings mainly depends on carrying out good nursery management practices in scheduled time. Management of nursery includes various operations _viz_. preparation of nursery site, preparation of growing medium by mixing soil and organic manure, filling of poly bags with growing medium, transporting of filled bags toexact nursery spot, proper arrangement of bags, planting of seed sprouts, shifting of primary seedlings to the secondary nursery spot, transferring of primary seedlings on to secondary bags, regular watering, periodical application of fertilizers and pesticides, periodical weeding in bags, inter space and around the nursery, preparation of seedlings by removing dry leaves, tilting of bags three weeks in advance of distribution, loading of seedlings onto tractor/truck, disposal of abnormal seedlings and removal of bags wherein seedlings are died. Here, cost includes labour charges for carrying out above mentioned activities and actual cost should be worked out based on the nature of work, quantity of work, activity frequency (watering, weeding, fertilizer & pesticide application) and area of work.

**Man power**: Man power cost includes salary of permanent nursery staff _i.e.,_ nursery manager, technical person, supporting persons and watch and ward. Planning, monitoring and supervision of nursery operations, procurement of inputs, observations on growth and health of seedlings, management of nursery operations as per the schedule, culling of abnormal seedlings, proper disposal of discarded seedlings, receiving, explanation and accompanying visitors, maintenance of registers and fixed assets, security of the nursery round the clock etc.

**Electricity charges**: Here, cost includes electricity charges paid at monthly interval.

**Repair and maintenance of fixed assets**: Charges for repair and upkeep of fixed assets as and when required can be taken into account for cost calculation.

**Payment for PEQ team**: Cost includes TA and DA and honorarium for periodical visits of Post Entry Quarantine team for monitoring of pest incidence in oil palm nursery.

**Miscellaneous expenditure**: Cost includes price of bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides and their application charges, charges for fixing of metal boards and display of needed information on boards at each block, purification of water, unexpected expenditure as and when required etc.

**Mortality of sprouts and seedlings**: Due to faulty planting of sprouts and serious pest incidence, death of seedlings prior to emergence of sprout and after emergence of one or two leaves is common in oil palm nursery during the primary stage. On average, mortality is about 5% for indigenous as well as imported stock. Only the expenditure incurred on raising 5,000

seed sprouts during the primary nursery stage can be taken into account for calculation of cost since 5% mortality is compensated by 5% extra seed sprout supply.

**Abnormality of seedlings**: Roughing or culling of genetically abnormal seedlings is an important and compulsory practice to avoid the loss to the farmer/grower in future. Inaddition to genetically abnormal seedlings, badly affected ones by pests and nutrient deficiency have to be removed and this is about 10% both in indigenous and imported seedlings. Here, the cost includes price of seed sprouts and expenditure made on 10,000 seedlings during the nursery period.

# Annexure-XIII

**The details of viability price, formula price and viability gap price calculation and its illustrations**

# Industry Payment in Rest of India, NER and Andaman & Nicobar Islands:

1.  The minimum industry payment from 1st November 2021 shall be 14.3% of the monthly CPO price. Industry will pay based on 14.3% of the average monthly price of CPO from 1st November 2021 to 31st October 2028. This payment by the industry shall increase by 0.25 % during next every three years from 1st November 2028, till 31st October 2037.
2.  To give impetus to the North East (NER) and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (A&N), specially because of the existing terrain, tough conditions and need for investment, the industry instead of FFB payment of 14.3 % of CPO price from 1st November 2021, shall start with a payment of 12.3 % of CPO price and Government of India will pay the differential 2 % of CPO price

, as special NER and A&N Islands payment, to ensure that the farmers of the NER and A&N Islands are paid at par with the rest of India. This payment by the industry as % of CPO in NER and A&N Islands shall increase by 0.5 % on every three years till 1st November 2037, while for NER and A&N Islands, special payment by Government of India shall reduce from2 % to 0 % by 2037.

1.  From 1st November 2037, the farmers will be paid 15.3% of CPO as FFBs Price.
2.  Presently through the Oil Palm Acts/ Regulations/Orders, State Governments are fixing the price for the FFBs which is paid by the industry to the farmers. In case States do not adopt theindustry payment approved in this scheme, they shall be at liberty to continue with their own payment system, and in such a case the industry will be mandated to pay the State mandated price.
3.  To ensure that State do not fix arbitrary prices, which hampers investment in the oil palm sector, it is approved to put a condition that payment of VGF or special NER payment by GOI shall be applicable only if the states adopt the formulation of payment of FFB price of the scheme. For this the states adopting the approved scheme payment pattern by the industry, they will sign a memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) with the Government of India for the same .
4.  The VGF and special payments to NER/A&N Islands A&N payout whenever due to the farmers is approved to be paid by DBT directly in the farmers account. As this is a support mechanism for the farmers, it is approved that 100% VGF & Special payments for NER and A&N Islands is made by the Government of India.

# 2 Viability Gap Payment (VGP):

The VGP shall be the payout given to the farmers for the FFB supplied to the industry. This shall be calculated on monthly basis during the Oil Palm Year (OPY). This viability gap paymentshall be the VP for the oil palm year minus the formula price for that particular month. From, 1st Nov 2021 to 31st Oct 2028, Government of India shall pay 100% difference between the VP and the FP price for a particular month in case it is positive. Thereafter, every 3 years (1st Nov 2028 to 31st Oct 2031; 1st Nov 31 to 31st Oct 2034 and 1st Nov 2034 to 31st Oct 2037), the payment will decrease by 25 % to reach landed CPO price in 2037 at sunset stage.

# Oil Palm Year

The Oil Palm Year (OPY) is considered from 1st November till 31st October of next year.

# Crude Palm Oil Price (CPO) and Formula Price

*   1.  At present the Kandla port handles around 35% of the landed CPO and the prices of Kandla port is a major factor for the CPO market. The major CPO is traded in the MCX exchange for delivery at Kandla. Analysis of MCX traded CPO price with AP Government price shows that Kandla price is 1.5 % more compared to the AP price.
    2.  Thus, it is approved to define the CPO price for this scheme as CPO price for Kandla delivery traded on MCX moderated on a lower side by 1.5 %.

# Formula price = 14.3% of CPO price.

*   1.  **Viability Price**

For the assured payment to the farmers, for the prices of FFBs during the Oil Palm Year (OPY), which is considered from 1st November till 31st October for next year, the viability Price (VP) shall be declared in November of each year. **This VP of FFBs per tonne shall be 14.3% of the annual average price of CPO of the last 5 year adjusted with wholesale price index (WPI) of all India**. Every year starting with OPY from the month of 1st November, the Government of India shall declare the VP for that OPY by a duly constituted committee of the Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. Through declaration of this VP, the farmers will know at the beginning of the year the price they will be paid for their produce of FFBs.

*   1.  **Formula Price**

The Formula price will be arrived on the basis of average monthly landed CPO price. Therefore, the formula price will be average monthly (of the preceding month) landed CPO price multiplied by a multiplication factor 14.30%, as applicable in case of the Viability Price. The Formula price would be used for the calculation of viability gap funding calculation in every month.

# For Wholesale Price Index (WPI),

*   *   *   The all India WPI data will be obtained from office of the Economic Adviser, Department of Commerce presently available at https://eaindustry.nic.in and calculation of WPI adjusted with traded CPO price of Kandla port at MCX portal.
        *   Based on this all India average of WPI (all Commodities) 5 years average of CPO price, WPI adjusted, shall be calculated as per the following illustration:

For the year 2021-22, price shall be declared based on average of the prices in 2016-17 adjusted by 4 years till 2020-21 by WPI, plus 2017-18 price adjusted with WPI for 3 years, plus 2018-19 price adjusted by WPI for 2 years, 2019-20 price adjusted by WPI for one year and 2020- 21 price. This 5-year average CPO price adjusted with WPI shall be multiplied by 14.3% to calculate the annual Viability price for the FFBs for the oil palm year.

**Viability Gap Payment (VGP):**

The Industry pays the farmers for their FFB produce based on the monthly prices fixed for the FFBs. **If the payment to farmers by the industry is below the VP, the Government will provide a VGP to ensure that the farmers payment reaches the VP**. In this scenario, the farmer would be entitled for

payment of VGP, which **shall be the VP for the Oil Palm Year (OPY) minus the Formula price (FP) for that particular month, in case the farmers payment by the industry is less then VP. The VGP** from, 1st Nov, 2021 to 31st Oct, 2028, shall be 100% difference between the VP and the FP price for a particular month. Thereafter, every 3 years (1st Nov, 2028 to 31st Oct, 2031; 1st Nov, 2031 to 31st Oct, 2034 and 1st Nov, 2034 to 31st Oct, 2037), will decrease by 25 % to reach landed CPO price in 2037. **There will be no VGP liability for the Government from 1st November 2037.**

**A. Summary**

In summary based on the above analysis, in case the states adopt the payment pattern of the scheme,the payment by GoI and Industry shall be as follows:

| Oil Year | Minimum Payment schedule by industry to farmers ( as % ofCPO) | Difference to be paid by GoI to the farmers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rest of India | N Estates & A & N Islands | Difference to be paid byGOI in North East states&(A&N)Islandsfor parity with ROI | Payment of VGP by GOI tofarmers as(Viability price-Formulaprice) |
| 1st Nov21to 31st Oct 28 | 14.30 | 12.30 | 14.30-12.30=2% | (Viability price-Formula price)x 100% |
| 1st Nov28to 31st Oct 31 | 14.55 | 13.05 | 14.55-13.05=1.5% | (Viability price-Formula price)x 75% |
| 1st Nov31to 31st Oct 34 | 14.80 | 13.80 | 14.80-13.80=1.0% | (Viability price-Formula price)x 50% |
| 1st Nov34to 31st Oct 37 | 15.05 | 14.55 | 15.05-14.55=0.5% | (Viability price-Formula price)x 25% |
| 1st Nov 37onwards | 15.30 | 15.30 | 15.30-15.30=0% | 0 |

_\* Subject to the condition that together with industry payment and NER and A&N Islands specialpayment by GOI, it does not exceed the viability price declared by the GOI._

In case States do not adopt the industry payment pattern of the scheme, then industry shall pay the state mandated price and in such a case, neither VGF or special NE payment shall be payable by GoI.

Though the funding for the approved NMEO (OP) for five years has been kept till

2025-26, since the sunset clause will be from November, 2037, thus the Government of India liabilities would continue till that time for the scheme as applicable. The farmers already cultivating oil palm would also be considered for VGF along with future growers of oil palm so that the confidence in the farmers is enhanced to go for oil palm cultivation.

1.  **MOU between State and Central Government:** .If the State is ready to adopt the approved payment pattern of FFBs, states have to sign MOU with the Government of India.
