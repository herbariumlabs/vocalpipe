### Development Agenda and Action plan for Sustainable Development Goals, 2030

_VISION_

_The vision of Assam agriculture is that of a vibrant sector which is an engine of growth for the state economy, provides food and nutritional security, supports the farmers for socio- economic uplift to have a comfortable life, minimizing environmental degeneration and helps the state in the path towards food self sufficiency and poverty eradication._

_MANDATE:_

_The mandate of the Directorate is to end hunger, poverty and provides respectable employment in agricultural sector for a decent living through sustainable manner._

_POLICY_

_The main policy objective is to create enabling conditions for an integrated agriculture system which is self sustaining, which contributes to the optimum extent to food security, balancing rising productivity with increases in farmers’ incomes. Other objectives include increasing resilience of the farming community, improving soil health, better use of water resources and conservation and appropriate use of common property resources and raising farmers’ standards of living by empowering them to carry out their activities in agriculture and allied sectors in a better manner with particular focus on women and youth. At the same time the policy has the objective to diversify agriculture to raise farm incomes and meet nutritional security of the farm families with a view to make these as primary sources of livelihood._

_Present status:_

*   _Agriculture is the principal occupation of majority (60%) of the rural population in the state in terms of employment and livelihood. Agriculture sector continues to providing employment of more than 50 per cent of the total workforce and support more than 75 per cent population of the state directly or indirectly._
*   _Growth in the agricultural sector now stands at 4.5 % and contributes 17.89% to the State Gross Domestic Product at current price (2013-14)._
*   _The total area under operational holding is 29.99070 ha distributed among re 27.20 lakh operational holders with an average land holding of 1.10 ha. About 85% of these holders belong to small and marginal categories._
*   _Agriculture sector continues to providing employment of more than 50 per cent of the total workforce and support more than 75 per cent population of the state directly or indirectly._
*   _The Gross cropped area has been reducing every year due to various reasons viz. soil erosion, urbanization, construction of road, population explosion, etc. The cropping intensity stands at 149% (2014-15) and the target is to raise it to 233% by 2030._

1.  In case of Rice, the state is surplus in quantity till date and this trend of production will be maintained for economic benefit of the farmers.
2.  In case of Pulses, the state is deficit in production and the major constraint of non-availability of locally produced seeds will be taken care of. The productivity trend indicates that the present production of 4.81 LMT has to be increased up to 4.97 LMT in order to feed the growing population by the end of 2030.
3.  The state is deficit in Oil seed production primarily because of lack of adaption to new and high yielding varieties. The present production of 4.32 LMT has to be increased up to 4.97 LMT in order to feed the population by the end of 2030. This will be achieved by introduction of new HYVs of oil seeds at right time, making availability of required quantity and application of improved methods of cultivation.

**B. Assam Vision relating to Agriculture**

### The Assam Vision 2030 under Goals 1 & 2 envisions that the Government will aim at adopting all steps to end poverty in all forms in the state, end hunger by achieving food security through sustainable agriculture.

The above goals can be achieved through the following activities:

*   1.  Sustainable management of Soil health for sustainable productivity
    2.  Provisioning inputs for higher production.
    3.  Agricultural Marketing and entrepreneurship

### C. Major issues in Assam’s Agriculture sector and actions required:

*   1.  Inadequate access to extension services by farmers:

Agriculture Extension Service in the state basically requires adequate manpower whose duty is to go to farmer’s level everyday and educate the farmers about up to date developments in the modern agricultural sector. They are also supposed to impart in situ training and show methodologies through demonstration. But the Department at present has only about 70% of requisite filed level extension staff and majority of them are also require to render their services to non-agricultural activities like NRC, electoral roll revision, etc. Crop production is a season bound activity and lack of timely extension services hampers in the production process.

Action required:

*   *   *   All vacant posts at field levels require to be filled up to fulfill the objective of the SDG under a specific time frame.
        *   Maximum numbers of inputs to be made available at Block level.
    
    1.  Small and fragmented land holding:

Absence of consolidation of agricultural land in a state with small and fragmented land holding is a major hurdle for use of improved machineries, etc. The average agricultural land holding in the state also shows a decreasing trend over the years as evident from the table shown in Table-2.

Table-2

| Average size of operational holdings |
| --- |
| Agriculture census | Average size (ha) |
| 1990-91 | 1.27 |
| 1995-96 | 1.17 |
| 2000-01 | 1.15 |
| 2005-06 | 1.11 |
| 2010-11 | 1.10 |
| Source: A Report on Change in economic condition of operational holders since 1970-71 to 2010-11, Directorate of Economics & Statistics page14, |

Action required:

*   *   *   Large machineries are required to increase production in consolidated land. A farm approach will be suitable to inject all inputs of higher production in order to achieve desired productivity and production.
    
    1.  Lack of certified seeds:

The state is self sufficient in the production of certified Paddy and Oil seeds but deficit in Pulse seeds.

*   *   *   Under the Vision 2030, a seed production plan for Paddy, Pulses & Oil seeds is to be prepared to cater the need of certified seeds up to 2030.
        *   AAU will be the technical supporter in breeding required varieties of all crops as well as special Pulse Seed Storage facilities.
    
    1.  Inadequate marketing facilities:

Farmers of the state are not good businessman and hence always depend on the middleman. Therefore, when they fetch good price of a commodity in a particular year, they naturally go for more production of that commodity in the following year and the principle of Demand & Supply affects them during the subsequent years. With such experience, they are disheartened and lose faith in agriculture.

Action required:

*   *   *   A well designed system of farm gate disposal of produces aided by value addition and export linkage is to be adopted.
        *   Govt. intervention for procurement of marketable surplus will be made.

1.  Efficiency and quality of public service delivery:

There has been no refresher’s training since many years after the abolition of Training & Visit system under Agricultural Extension service. The world is making progress at very high speed while the department is still locked with the old Packages of Practices (PoP).

Action required:

*   *   Agricultural field level functionaries require regular refreshing courses and workshops for improvement of knowledge.
    *   This will be done through introduction of regular refreshing courses in collaboration with the AAU/other national institutes and publication of PoP.

1.  Marketing & entrepreneurship:

Rural farmers are financially not so sound to adapt agri-entreprenureship activities on their own. For this reason, a substantial portion of their produces are wasted in the farm gate. Action required:

*   *   A well designed marketing and value addition scheme is to be placed in action.
    *   Private sector entrepreneurs are to be encouraged to participate in the agricultural marketing through value addition, etc.

1.  Fostering technological innovation: Everyday innovation is taking place in the field of agriculture all over the country for better production and economic return by farmers.
    *   Therefore, innovative practices adopted in other states which are feasible to our conditions will be introduced in the state.
    *   Mapping of soil nutrient status of each farmer will be completed. Farmers will be able to get their status of soil through Mobile Phone messages.
2.  Policy and institutional changes to facilitate service delivery: The state of Assam is in much need of an Agricultural Policy for implementation of various agricultural activities. Main elements of the policy will be land, water, seed, pesticides, marketing, climate change, etc.
    *   Works on the Agricultural Policy has already been started in association with Assam Agricultural University
    *   The process of amending the APMC Act, in order to resolve the issue of collection of cess /tax by P & RD and Assam State Agricultural Marketing Board has started.

### D. Planning for resource requirements

1.  Financial resources.
    *   Financial requirement has been calculated taking various scales of finances and guidelines received from time to time.
    *   In case of Central sector scheme, the fund ration has been kept at 90:10 for central and state shares. In case of state plan schemes, it has been kept as 100 % grants in aid. In case of PPP mode of implementation, the ration has been kept as 50:50.

The Department will achieve Assam vision for Agriculture in the state by financial management as follows:

*   Sharing cost in between the govt. (in cash) and the beneficiaries (in kinds)
*   Inviting private players for infrastructure and capacity building and then to run on pay and use system (e.g. Soil Testing laboratories, small processing/packaging unit, transportation vans, etc.)
*   Cutting costs through technological innovations (use of solar power, low cost machineries, ITK, etc.)
*   Accepting financial assistance from NABARD, NEC and other such institutions.
*   Securing additional resources from outside the state/country (Additional Central Assistance, IFAD, World Bank, and other International funding).

1.  Human Resources
2.  Agricultural technologies changes every day and it is more pertinent in view of the climate change effects. Therefore, a strategy for developing human resources is necessary to achieve Assam Vision 2030 for Agricultural sector. Again considering the reducing land holding trend, the future batches of producers need to be more technologically knowledgeable and commercially sensitive for planned agriculture. Therefore, in addition to increasing the technological knowhow of the departmental personnel, capacity building of producers and entrepreneurs too will be taken up effectively to deal with all situations for maintaining sustainability of productivity and production.
3.  The placement of employees will be reorganized for efficient functioning of the department.
4.  Infrastructure requirements.
5.  The Govt. has recently created some administrative districts in the state. At present, District Agricultural Officers, Sub-Divisional Agricultural Officers, Agricultural Development Officers and Agricultural Extension Assistants have to cover a large geographical area. As per norm, an AEA (earlier known as VLEW) has to cater the need of about 1000 farmers but this number has been almost doubled over the years. Again, added by continuously increasing number of schemes, concerned officials have not been able to effectively supervise and monitor the departmental activities which are a big constraint for sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the area of jurisdiction will be reduced at each level by creation of new Agricultural Districts, Sub-divisions and AEA elekas out of the existing areas. Considering the increasing need of Agricultural mechanization, there is also a need for creation of new offices of Executive Engineer (Agri) and Assistant Executive Engineer. Thus, new offices are to be established for effective administration and extension services.
6.  Soil Testing Laboratories: Establishment of new and up gradation of departmental Soil Testing Laboratories (STL).

| Soil Testing Laboratories | 2016-17 (actual) | 2019-2020 (cumulative) | 2023-24 (cumulative) | 2029-30 (cumulative) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | 25 | 33 | 33 |

1.  Administrative infrastructure development: In view of Govt.’s announcement of few new districts, the following infrastructure is necessary for extension activities at field level.

| Office | 2016-17 (actual) | 2019-2020 (cumulative) | 2023-24 (cumulative) | 2029-30 (cumulative) |

**Actions for reducing poverty & hunger**

Benchmarking and collection of data**:**

*   *   The Directorate of Agriculture conducts statistical survey including production of crops by taking up crop cutting experiments with Revenue department at field levels and these are taken as forecast data for the current year. However, the Directorate of Economics & Statistics finally analyse the data and publishes it as official document.

Soil is the mother of productivity and good health of soil for sustainable fertility is the first thing in the process of optimum production. Therefore, the first action on the SDG 2030 would be to improve and maintain the good health of soil.

### Soil Health Management:

*   *   Farmers at present are applying plant nutrients without knowing the actual requirement and very often a major part of nutrients are wasted in the soil. Therefore, the cost of cultivation gets increased.
    *   The SHC provides the exact requirement of plant nutrient and therefore it will cut the cost of plant nutrient up to 30% thereby decreasing the cost of cultivation. This means there will be an increase by 30% of income of farmers.

### Digitisation of soil health data:

*   *   The locations of crop fields of farmers have been digitized under GPS system. Soil Health Cards are now available in the website and farmers can download it in concerned CSC for knowing the status of their soil nutrients.

**Production of certified seeds:** Once the soil health managed well, the second requirement will be the quality seeds. Therefore, a comprehensive seed production programme will be taken up to meet the requirement of certified seeds.

*   *   Certified seeds produced from Breeder and Foundation seeds bear the quality of producing true type of grains in field and such seeds can be used for three consecutive years after which famers should use again new certified seeds. Lack of HYV seeds and their distribution at right time at farmer’s doorsteps are main reasons for low production of many crops in the state. The Govt. has taken up massive production programme of such seeds in the state. Use of certified seeds (Seed Replacement Rate expressed inn%) will increase about 40% yield of crops thereby bringing 40% more income to farmers. Farmers will also be benefited by selling their own certified seeds in the markets.

### Enhancing production of Paddy, Pulses and Oil seeds.

*   *   The Department has been showcasing different improved techniques of crop production to farmers since many years but all farmers are yet to adopt such practices. Crop demonstration is continuous practice with introduction of new crop varieties and techniques with the passage of time. There is a gap between the prescribed and adopted methods of crop cultivation in the field. If this gap is eliminated, there will be at least 40% more production of crops. Therefore, improved demonstrations will be conducted in farmers’ field by the department. These will invariably associated with incorporation of new HYVs, distribution of machineries and other inputs. Thus, enhancement of production will increase the income of farmers as well as empower them to buy other food items to end hunger.

**New technologies, innovations, etc. to reduce fuel cost and increasing income:**

**Installation of Solar powered Shallow Tube Wells** has been stated in the state. This has helped the farmers to save fuel cost thereby saving money.

### Marketing of surplus Paddy:

*   *   Paddy being the staple crop always results in marketable surplus. Instead of discouraging the surplus production, a way for disposal of the same has been worked out for increase of farmer’s income. The Department has initiated procurement of surplus paddy through Assam State Agricultural Marketing Board (ASAMB) and FCI helping them to earn from their produce.
    *   The Govt., as a land mark initiative, has taken up to implement a market linked project- **Assam Project on Agri-business for Rural Transformation (APART)** for production of many commodities in an organized way under FPO, value addition and marketing in the state. This will add to the other steps taken for ending poverty and hunger in the state.

**Seven Years Strategic Plan (2017-18 to2023-24)**

The year wise requirements of different interventions have been calculated and a seven year strategy has been evolved as follows:

## Strategy-1: Increasing productivity and production:

A-Soil Health (productivity) Management:

1-Improvement and up gradation of existing Soil Testing Laboratories (STLs) to cater the need of testing different soil parameters. 2-Installation of ICP-Optical Emission Spectroscopy machine in STLs. for proper functioning of the laboratories.

3-Distribution of Soil Health Cards to all farmers B-Production of certified seeds:

*   *   Maintaining self sufficiency of certified Paddy and Oil seed production
    *   Utilisation of full potentiality of Departmental as well as ASC Ltd.’s seed farms is producing farms.
    *   Reorganizing of existing manpower in seed farms.
    *   Expansion of Seed production programmes to famer’s field in PPP mode at least to produce 30% of the total requirement by facilitating the farmers for such production.
    *   Making provisions for selling farmer’s seeds through ASC sales counters distributed all over the state.
    *   Developing/designing special seed storage bins for Pulse seeds in order to avoid the storage of pulse seed created by high humidity condition during the rainy season with the help of AAU
    *   Increasing cropping Intensity
    *   Strengthening the Assam State Seed Certification Agency

## Strategy -2: Enhancement of production:

This will be achieved through enhancing capacity building, increase in SRR, enhancement of mechanization & irrigation potential, resilient practices to climate change affects and initiating marketing linkage of farm produces.

1.  Production of Paddy:
    *   Maintaining the status of Paddy production
    *   Popularisation of Hybrid paddy in limited areas of small and marginal farmers in the light of reducing area of cultivation year by year.
    *   Bringing 10% under Hybrid and 90% under HYV of the total Winter Paddy area. In case of Summer Paddy, it will be in the ration of 20: 80.
    *   Integrated Nutrient Management based on soil test data.
    *   Integrated Pest Management
    *   Organizing front line demonstrations for maximizing profitability of rice.
    *   Thrust on increased mechanization
    *   Providing assured means of irrigation.
    *   Expansion of low cost irrigation machineries. 2-Production of Pulses:
    *   Area expansion under Pulse crop in areas of Rice fallow areas and Kharif pulses.
    *   The existing 1.3 lakh ha area of pulses will be increased to 3.0 lakh ha
    *   Introduction of new HYVs of pulses.

3-Production of Oil seeds:

*   Expansion of oil seed crop.
*   Bringing The existing 2.8 lakh ha area of Oil seeds will be increased to 4.0 lakh ha
*   Introduction of new HYVs of oil seed crops.
*   Critical and life saving irrigation practices in oil seed crops.

### Strategy-3: Marketing:

Marketing of surplus Paddy:

*   Efforts had been made by the Department of Agriculture since 2013-14 for procurement of marketable surplus of paddy. The Assam Agricultural Marketing Board and FCI are procuring surplus paddy from farmers at selected locations. The number of collection centers will be increased for the ease of delivery by farmers.
*   A World Bank aided project in the name & style of Assam Project on Agri-business for Rural Transformation (APART) has been started for development of an efficient marketing system in the state.
*   Creating awareness of improving the quality of stored paddy

### Strategy-4: Capacity building (T & V):

*   Introduction of Training & Visit system of extension education.
*   Refresher’s course for extension functionaries
*   Training of producers

### Strategy-5: Human resource and Infrastructure development:

*   Establishment of new District and Sub-divisional Agriculture offices
*   New offices of Executive Engineer (Agri.) and Assistant Agricultural Engineer

**3 Year Action Plan (2017-18 to 2019-20)**

1.  The three-Year Action Plan is based on the Seven-year Strategic Agenda described above. The Action Plan, however, focus on immediate actions needed in the three-year period 2016-17 to 2019-20.

### Assessment of existing programs and rationalization of schemes and programs

1\. The Department proposes to undertake an immediate review of all current schemes to assess their usefulness. Third party assessments will also be encouraged. The programs that are required only for one or two times will be phased out. There will be need for discarding some programs and schemes and rationalizing and integrating others.
