# National Food Security Mission Operational Guidelines

## Introduction

*   1.  The National Development Council (NDC) in its 53rd meeting held on 29th May, 2007 adopted a resolution to launch a Food Security Mission comprising rice, wheat and pulses to increase the annual production of rice by 10 million tons, wheat by 8 million tons and pulses by 2 million tons by the end of the Eleventh Plan (2011-12). Accordingly, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, 'National Food Security Mission' (NFSM), was launched in October 2007. The Mission met with an overwhelming success and achieved the targeted additional production of rice, wheat and pulses. The Mission is being continued during 12th Five Year Plan with new targets of additional production of food grains of 25 million tons of food grains comprising of 10 million tons rice, 8 million tons of wheat, 4 million tons of pulses and 3 million tons of coarse cereals by the end of 12th Five Year Plan. Based on past experience and feedback received from the States major changes have been made in approach, norms of financial assistance and programme implementation strategy which are reflected in the revised operational guidelines.
    2.  The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) during the 12th Five Year Plan will have five components (i) NFSM- Rice; (ii) NFSM-Wheat; (iii) NFSM-Pulses, (iv) NFSM-Coarse cereals and (v) NFSM-Commercial Crops.

## Objectives

*   1.  Increasing production of rice, wheat, pulses and coarse cereals through area expansion and productivity enhancement in a sustainable manner in the identified districts of the country;
    2.  Restoring soil fertility and productivity at the individual farm level; and
    3.  Enhancing farm level economy (i.e. farm profits) to restore confidence amongst the farmers.

## Strategy

To achieve the above objectives, the Mission would adopt following strategies:

1.  Focus on low productivity and high potential districts including cultivation of food grain crops in rain fed areas.
2.  Implementation of cropping system centric interventions in a Mission mode approach through active engagement of all the stakeholders at various levels.
3.  Agro-climatic zone wise planning and cluster approach for crop productivity enhancement.
4.  Focus on pulse production through utilization of rice fallow, rice bunds and intercropping of pulses with coarse cereals, oilseeds and commercial crops (sugarcane, cotton, jute).
5.  Promotion and extension of improved technologies i.e., seed, integrated nutrient management (INM) including micronutrients, soil amendments, integrated pest management (IPM), input use efficiency and resource conservation technologies along with capacity building of the farmers/extension functionaries.
6.  Close monitoring of flow of funds to ensure timely reach of interventions to the target beneficiaries.
7.  Integration of various proposed interventions and targets with the district plan of each identified district.
8.  Constant monitoring and concurrent evaluation by the implementing agencies for assessing the impact of the interventions for a result oriented approach.

e) Jute Technology Mission (JTM)

## Interventions

Interventions proposed under the four components (Rice, Wheat, Pulses and Coarse Cereals) of NFSM are given below whereas norms of financial assistance are summarized in **Annexure-V.**

#### Accelerated Crop Production Programme (ACPP)

Large blocks of crop areas will be taken up for demonstration of production and protection technologies in a cropping system based mode. A cafeteria of crop specific interventions (bio-fertilizers, nutrients, plant protection chemicals, weedicides etc.) has been illustrated ( Annexure-VI ) to enable the states to choose interventions relevant to that particular Agro-climatic zone for demonstrations.

##### Demonstrations

1.  Field demonstrations of improved package of practices will be conducted on cropping system as well as on sole crop.
2.  The cropping system based approach which has been included under NFSM entails that demonstrations are done in cropping sequence on the same plot of land. States should conduct at least 30 % demonstrations under cropping system based approach.
3.  **Area of operation:** The demonstrations will be conducted in a contiguous block by dividing the fields in two blocks, one for improved practices and the other for farmer's practices in a cluster of 100 ha or more. Size of cluster for hill and north-eastern States will be 10 ha. The lowest productivity areas in selected districts should be given priority. Demonstrations should be evenly distributed within and among selected clusters.
4.  All farmers in a cluster would be included in a demonstration. For each farmer, at least 0.4 ha area will be included in demonstration.
5.  **Selection of beneficiary Farmers:** Gram Panchayat should be in involved in selection of beneficiary farmers. Only the farmers willing to cooperate and contribute some of the

resources should be selected. Selection of beneficiaries should be done adopting participatory approach by holding meetings in the village by explaining the objectives of the demonstrations and role and responsibilities including expectations from the participating farmers.

1.  **Selection of Site:** Demonstration site should be easily accessible for the farmers and the extension workers. It should not be on an isolated field. The selected site should be the representative of soil type and soil fertility status of the area.
2.  **Soil Analysis:** As far as possible soil fertility status of the selected field should be known well in advance for deciding the use of fertilizer and soil ameliorants.
3.  **Identification of Technologies to be demonstrated:** The improved practices for the demonstration plots should be identified in consultation with SAU through their Regional Research Stations/KVKs located in the area. However, the most critical inputs should be given top priority. For example correction of soil acidity through liming should be done while conducting a demonstration on improved package on acid soils. The varieties to be included in the package should preferably be new varieties.
4.  **Development of package of inputs to be distributed:** Once the technologies are identified, a package of inputs including micronutrients and bio-fertilizers should be finalized as to which inputs are to be provided for the conduct of demonstrations. Similarly the inputs to be contributed by the beneficiary farmers (if required) may also be assessed.
5.  **Distribution of demonstration kits and training of participating farmers:** An orientation training programme should be organized to brief the beneficiary farmers about the procedure to be followed for conducting demonstrations. Farmers should be informed about the critical operations for the demonstrations. The demonstration kits may be distributed to the farmers during the training programme. The demonstrations should be conducted by extension functionaries of the State Department of Agriculture under the supervision of District Consultant.

1.  wheat-summer moong
2.  wheat relay crop with cotton
3.  wheat –kharif pulses
4.  wheat-coarse cereals( maize, bajra)

#### Pulses

Demonstrations will be conducted on pulse-crop-based cropping system and pulses as intercrops with commercial crops ( sugarcane, cotton etc.), oilseeds (soybean, groundnut etc.) and coarse cereals. SAU/ICAR/KVKs may be approached for recommended intercropping systems and associated package of practices.

#### Coarse Cereals

Demonstrations will be on coarse cereal crops and coarse cereal based cropping- systems. The crops involved are maize, sorghum, barley, pearl millet, finger millet and small millets (Kudos, Barnyard, Foxtail, Proso and Little millet (Kutki). Intercropping systems such as maize + urd/ moong/ pigeonpea, sorghum + kharif pulses, pearl millet + urd/ moong/pigeonpea/mothbean/any otherpulse should be selected depending on the area.

#### Cost Norms of Demonstration

The cost of demonstration for one ha area for sole crop (excluding coarse cereals) will Rs 7500/- and Rs. 12,500/-for a cropping sequence. For coarse cereals, the cost of demonstration for one ha area will be Rs. 5000/-. The cost of demonstrations includes organization of field day, distribution of publicity material and visit of scientists/GOI and state officials @Rs. 250, Rs. 250 and Rs. 300, respectively. Illustrative lists of interventions that can be taken up within the amount fixed for demonstrations are given in **annexure-VI**. In the annual Action Plan State Government will clearly specify the interventions proposed to be demonstrated. The interventions selected should be based on the recommendations made by SAU/Zonal Research Station for the Agro climatic Zone concerned. Beneficiary farmers should be asked to arrange recommended quantity of chemical fertilizers. Additional cost, if any should be borne by the farmer. For an individual farmer, the area under demonstration should not exceed 2 ha.

#### Need based inputs (Seed, Nutrients, Soil Ameliorants, Bio-fertilizers, Plant Protection,Farm Machines and Training)

*   *   1.  **Distribution of hybrid / certified seed**
            1.  Seed producing agencies (NSC/SSCs/SAUs/ICAR Institutes/Private Companies) authorized by the State will distribute seed to selected districts. The DFSMEC will finalize the list of beneficiaries in consultation with Village Panchayat. Assistance for purchase of seeds will be available to selected farmers for the area not exceeding 2 ha each. Assistance for purchase of seed is as below:

#### Rice

*   *   *   *   1.  Hybrids - Rs.50/kg or 50% of the cost whichever is less
                2.  Varieties less than 10 years old- Rs.10/kg

#### Wheat

Varieties less than 10 years old-Rs.10/kg

#### Pulses

Varieties less than 10 years old-Rs.25/kg or 50% of the cost, whichever is less

#### Coarse Cereals

1.  Hybrids-Rs.50/kg
2.  Varieties less than 10 years old- Rs.15/kg or 50% of the cost whichever is less.
    *   *   1.  In case of supply of seeds by Central Seed Agencies like NSC/SFCI, reimbursement of subsidy for distribution of Hybrid/HYV seeds of rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses will be made directly by the Ministry to such agency, within 20% of State’s Seed distribution target in identified NFSM districts on

the basis of verification by Districts/States and adjusted from the State’s overall allocation under seed

distribution component.

#### Nutrient management / soil ameliorants

1.  This component will be implemented by the State Department of Agriculture. The DFSMEC will finalize the list of beneficiaries in consultation with Village Panchayat.
2.  The micronutrients/lime/gypsum or other sulphur containing fertilizers such as phosphor- gypsum/ bentonite sulphur will be applied as basal/foliar application based on the recommendations of ICAR/SAUs concerned. A farmer will be given assistance for a maximum of 2 ha area for the target crop. Following assistance or 50% of the cost whichever is less will be provided:
    1.  Micronutrient: @Rs.500 per ha
    2.  Liming or paper mud of acidic soil: @ Rs.1000 per ha
    3.  Gypsum/other sources of sulphur @Rs.750 per ha
3.  Use of bio-fertilizers such as Rhizobium, phosphate solubilizing bacteria(PSB) in pulses @Rs. 100 per ha or 50% of the cost whichever is less.
4.  Crop components covered will be rice, wheat and pulses.

##### Plant Protection Measures

*   *   *   1.  Financial assistance of Rs. 500 per ha or 50% of the cost whichever is less will be provided for Integrated Pest Management including plant protection chemicals , bio-pesticides and weedicides in the identified districts. The DFSMEC will finalize the list of beneficiaries in consultation with Village Panchayat.
            2.  A farmer will be given assistance for a maximum of 2 ha area for the target crop.

#### Farm Mechanization

1.  Mechanization will help in timely completion of field operations, improving the efficacy of field operations, increasing cropping intensity and economize the cost of cultivation.
2.  Weeds pose a major problem in rice; especially those planted with SRI technique/Direct Seeded Rice. Mechanical control of weeds along with chemicals is an effective option.
3.  The time available for the sowing of wheat following rice is limited particularly in rainfed/partially irrigated areas. The delayed sowing of wheat leads to significant reduction in its yield. Use of seed drills for planting wheat/pulses/coarse cereals enables farmers to cover large area in a short period and utilization residual soil moisture. Besides, seed drill sowing leads to uniform crop stand and row spacing which require less quantity of seed and facilitates inter-culture operations.
4.  Tractor drawn rotavator or turbo seeder pulverizes the soil, chops and mixes crop residues in the soil.
5.  Farm implements and pattern of assistance to be provided are given in Annexure-V.
6.  The farm implements, particularly rotavator, turbo seeder, seed drill, multi crop planter and multi crop harvester should conform to ISI standards or certified by Farm Machinery Training & Testing Institutes of Government of India, CIAE, Bhopal or SAUs.
7.  SFSMEC would nominate the agency and fix the cost of the farm implements for supplying the same to the selected farmers.
8.  50% of the farmers selected for assistance for Farm Mechanization shall be those who have also been selected for cluster demonstrations.
9.  The list of beneficiaries would be prepared by the District Agriculture Officer in consultation with the Zilla Parishad and approved by the DFSMEC. Cost of the machine, inclusive of the admissible subsidy and the farmers share, would be reimbursed by ATMA to the agency fixed by the SFSMEC for supplying the machines to the selected beneficiaries.
10.  CIAE, Bhopal/SAU would be the nodal institute for technical support.

#### Training

Training of trainers/farmers plays crucial role in speedy dissemination of improved crop production practices. Since the Mission has adopted cropping system-based approach, it is proposed to organize four sessions of each training. One at the beginning of kharif and rabi season, one each during kharif and rabi season. The training will be imparted by crop/subject matter specialists of ICAR institutes/SAUs/KVKs and will involve crop management (agronomic and plant protection practices) including primary processing of produce, storage etc. There will be a group of 30 participants/farmers in each session and participants in all four sessions will be same. A sum of Rs 14000/- per training (Rs.3500/- per session /-) will be available. The item-wise breakup of training given as under:

| Item | Rate (Rs.) | Amount (Rs.) for 4 sessions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Honorarium for one trainer | Rs.500/- per session | 2000.00 |
| Training material & stationary | Rs.500/- per session | 2000.00 |
| Refreshment for trainees, supporting staff | Rs.50/- head persession for 35 persons | 7000.00 |
| Contingency, POL transport ,etc. | Rs.750/- per session | 3000.00 |
|  | Total | 14000.00 |

*   1.  **Commercial Crop-based cropping systems**: The cropping system approach and inter-cropping of pulses with commercial crops especially cotton, jute and sugarcane leads to improved land use efficiency and better use of land and water resources. The main objectives of including commercial crop based cropping systems are i) to utilize vacant inter-row space of commercial Crops for growing pulses; ii) to generate higher net returns and cultivable land utilization index as compared to mono- cropping; iii) to improve soil fertility status; iv) to facilitate IPM strategies and reduce pest incidence through cropping system approach; v) to demonstrate latest technologies of intercropping, seed production; and vi) to implement need based interventions in cotton, jute and sugarcane crops. The annual action plans would be prepared by the State Governments in consultation with the respective Crop Development Directorate and would be approved by the NFSMEC. The activities would be implemented by the States in close coordination with the Crop Development Directorates. Separate guidelines would be issued for commercial crops. A summary of activities is at **annexure- VII (a-b).**

## Research Support:

*   *   1.  In order to facilitate the conduct of strategic adaptive research, address various research issues and gaps of potential yield and yield realized at farmers’ field of food crops, research projects will be supported during the 12th Plan. SAUs, National and International research organizations may submit research proposals on the themes given below.

    *   1.  **Training of extension functionaries:** In order to propagate latest crop specific technologies amongst Central and State functionaries who are involved in implementation of NFSM programme, the SAUs, National and International research organizations would be assisted to organise crop specific trainings within the country.

## Other Initiatives

1.  **Specialized projects for high productivity areas:** For sustainability of the high productivity areas, special projects such as reclamation of problematic soils, development of water-logged areas and mitigation of adverse effect of climate change would be funded under the Mission. A sum of Rs.600 crores has been earmarked for funding such project during 12th Plan. States may submit project proposals relating to these areas provided that these areas are not covered under regular development schemes. The proposals vetted by the SFSMEC would be accorded approval by NFSMEC on case to case basis. The unit cost of these project proposals would be limited to Rs.50, 000 per ha including farmer share of 25%. The total cost of each project proposal should not exceed Rs.10 crore and the project proposal should be for areas covered under NFSM. The suggestive interventions for the development of such area as:

a. **Reclamation of problematic soils:** i) The surveys and project preparation; ii) Land development activities; iii) Rate of application of amendments and cost (gypsum, phospho-gypsum, pyrites etc) based on severity of alkalinity/salinity etc; iv) Crops tolerant to alkalinity/salinity/acidity etc. adapting the reclamation packages etc.

b. **Development of water-logged areas:** i) The surveys for the project preparation; ii) Construction of field/community ditches linking to natural drains or pumping of the excess water to a natural

drainage lines and related activities; iii) Evaluation of crops tolerant to water-logging etc.

c. **Projects to combat the effect of climate change:** The projects aimed at mitigating adverse effect of climate change in high productivity areas would qualify for the financial support. The demonstration of heat tolerant varieties, promotion of micro-irrigation system (drip and sprinkler) for protective irrigation etc. would be focused.

1.  **Support to institutes/organizations including NGOs in remote areas:** It is experienced that reaching out to farmers in remote areas is difficult due to poor accessibility. These regions are mostly rainfed and inhabited by tribal and poor farmers. States may identify such areas requiring

special efforts for raising productivity of food grain crops. Suitable institutes/organizations

including NGOs may be entrusted to undertake clusters demonstrations in these areas. The cost norms for demonstrations specified in **annexure-V** will be followed. In addition, 10% of cost of demonstration may be paid as institutional charge. State/district authorities will monitor the work done. Suitable institutes/organizations including NGOs will be identified at district level for this purpose based on the criteria suggested below:

1.  At least 3 years experience of successful execution of agriculture/rural development projects in remote/backward areas.
2.  Should have accounts audited for all programmes implemented during past three years.
3.  **Value Chain integration of small producers:**Majority of the farmers are small producers who face difficulties in managing high risk involved in farming mainly due to weather aberrations, uneven access to technologies, unreliable input supplies, erratic power supply, inadequate marketing arrangements etc. Their situation is likely to worsen in the near future if these challenges are not addressed. Forming and strengthening of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) is likely to mitigate at least some of the risks and constraints faced by the farmers. The formation of FPOs may offer a collective strength for seed production and seed procurement, access to credit and improved technologies, reduce transaction costs, facilitate value addition, tap high value markets and enter into partnerships with private entities on more equitable terms. SFAC has already demonstrated the benefits of aggregating farmers into FPOs during the XI Plan.

States will be required to submit their action plans for FPO promotion, to be undertaken through SFAC or similar organisations, along with their annual action plans. Assistance for FPO promotion will be available for a maximum period of three years as per the FPO Process Guidelines of DAC. The Action Plans must specify the commodity, target area and target producers, besides the manner in which value addition will be undertaken during the promotion of FPOs. The Action Plan should be broadly divided into four areas viz. (i) Mobilization, training, exposure and capacity building interventions (ii) agriculture based livelihood interventions such as trial and demonstration of Good Agriculture Practices (replacement of varieties, pre-and Post-sowing practices, seed production and dissemination, INM, IPM, etc.) (iii) formation and development of Kissan Producer Company or other institutional form, which will include

awareness building, federating, drafting constitution, registration of the company, develop and establish system and procedures related to administration, accounts, HR, develop business plan and implementation, statutory compliance , etc. and (iv) linkage to value chain (marketing). SFAC will assist the States in drawing up action plans, if required. States will also have the flexibility to undertake FPO promotion through any other Central, State, civil society or private in the Process Guidelines for FPOs referred to above, will be followed in such sector entity of their choice. However, the methodology of selecting such entities, as laid down cases. A copy of the FPO Process Guidelines is available on the DAC and SFAC web sites. The component wise financial provisions for one FPO of 1000 farmers under Value Chain Integration of Small and Marginal farmers is given at **Annexure-VIII.**

1.  **Assistance to Custom Hiring Centres:** For small land holders, the farm mechanization by individual farm families is economically not viable. Therefore, such farm holders utilize the services of Custom Hiring Centres for the various farm operations. Also, under special cases, community operations of selected farm activities are required to be undertaken within a time frame. In view of this, provision has been made to subsidize cost of hiring machines for farming operations at individual farmer/community level. The machines can be hired from existing Custom Hiring Centres and/or Custom Hiring Centres to be established under the National Mission on Agricultural Mechanization. The States may submit proposals with subsidy for hiring machines for farm operations not exceeding Rs. 1500/- per hectare. The proposals submitted by the States would be approved by the NFSMEC.
2.  **Marketing support for pulses and millets:** For promoting the production of pulses and millets, it is proposed that marketing support would be provided to growers in form of insurance cover, Dal mill and millet processing unit to individual/communities, incentives to processing agencies etc. Assistance will be limited to 50% of the cost of the items. Funds will be allocated to SFAC and similar organizations at Centre/State levels against specific proposals approved by NFSMEC. The support for value addition and marketing in pulses and millets is given **annexure-VIII** will cover the following areas:-
3.  Establishment of mini dal mills by farmers, farmer groups or registered FPOs (@Rs.

10.00 lakhs, or 30% of the total cost, whichever is lower, as one time support)

1.  Support for branding and marketing of milled pulses or millets (available only to registered FPOs @Rs.5.00 lakh per FPO, for one time support only)
2.  Marketing support to un-registered farmer groups, SHGs, SHG federation etc. for local marketing of pulses and millets (@Rs.2.00 lakh per group of 15 farmers, for one time support only).
3.  Support to registered FPOs to set up and equip procurement centres to grade and process pulses and millets (@Rs.5.00 lakh per FPO for one time support only)

Proposals for marketing support to individual farmers, informal farmer groups, SHGs / SHG federations and registered FPOs must form part of the annual Action Plan of the States.

#### Exposure visit to International Organizations

1.  In order to enrich the knowledge base of the technical personnel involved in the Mission, exposure visit/training of technical officers/staff at international organizations like IRRI, CYMMIT, ICRISAT, AVRDC, ICARDA or any other research organization in crop production technologies etc. would be organized.
2.  A sum of Rs.3 crores will be provided for the entire Plan period.
3.  NFSMEC would approve the proposal of exposure visits /trainings.

#### Award for the best performing districts

1.  There would be awards for outstanding performance by the districts for the implementation of NFSM. The award amount provided is Rs. 5 lakh per district for each of the four components - NFSM Wheat, Rice, Pulses and Coarse Cereals. The funds for this purpose will be released to States after getting proposals from the State Level Agency duly vetted by SFSMEC.
2.  Awards at State level would be given at interval of two years for the best performing district under each of the four NFSM components-Rice, Wheat, Pulses and Coarse Cereals. The number of awards to be given away would be one award per five NFSM districts for each crop.
3.  At National level, awards would be given to best performing States under all crop categories annually. A total of 7 Awards; consisting of 3 Awards to States for highest food production and 4 Awards – one each for the highest production under rice, wheat, pulses and coarse cereals will be given annually. The Award amount is Rs.2.0 crore to each state of highest food grain production categories and Rs.1.0 crore for the individual crop category.
4.  The State level awards will be given preferably by the Governor/Chief Minister of the concerned State on Independence Day/ Republic Day/ Gandhi Jayanti etc. The National awards will be given by the Agriculture Minister. The money for the award will be utilized for the development of the infrastructure of the district/state agriculture department following the laid out norms of the State Government.
5.  The performance of the districts will be judged by assigning weights to various activities on a scale of 100. The highest scoring district in a State will be selected for the award. Following criteria will be adopted to judge the performance of the districts:
