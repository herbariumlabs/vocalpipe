CERTIFIED ORGANIC FARMING(RKVY)2016-17

# Introduction :

Organic farming is an eco-friendly farming system. It improves the soil fertility in a natural way to sustain the farming system. It produces quality as well as safe food for human beings and other animals also. As a whole it takes care of soil as well as human health.

At present one organic farming scheme under RKVY is running in 60 (sixty)nos of Assembly constituencies covering 3920 ha. The crops are non basmati rice like Joha , fine HYV rice, black rice , spices and vegetables.

The scheme adopted during 2013-14 and the actual execution year started during later part of 2014-15 only. It is a three year programme and as such though the project should come to an end during 2016-17, but it will take some more time to get full organic certificates.

There are two certification bodies like SGS India Pvt. Ltd and One Cert Asia. SGS has been working in 33(Thirty three )Constituencies where inspection for full organic certificate is over.But as per new norms, the farmers’ group(60 nos of Organic Growers societies)are to be registered under Society Act,1860 for obtaining full organic certificate.The process of registration is on and accordingly after registration the matter will be forwarded to the certification bodies for necessary issue of full organic certificate. The inspection for full organic certificate for remaining 27 (twenty seven ) farms (by One cert Asia) will start from August ,2017 onwards.

Objective :

1.  To maintain natural soil health for the next generations.
2.  To produce healthy and safe food.
3.  To fetch premium price by the Organic farmers leading to higher income.
4.  To generate employment opportunity to unemployed youths.
5.  To conserve biodiversity.
