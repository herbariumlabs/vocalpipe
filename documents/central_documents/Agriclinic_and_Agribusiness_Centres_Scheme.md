1. Selection of Nodal Training Institutes:

   1. Press advertisement inviting application from eligible institutions will be issued once in a year, so that selection of NTIs can be done in a time bound manner. However, additional applications may be taken during the year, if deemed necessary. After initial scrutiny of applications (received in the format provided at Annexure II) by MANAGE, eligible Institutions shall be visited by a team comprising Director, CAD, MANAGE or any other Director nominated by the Director General, representative of ATMA, Department of Agriculture at the State level, Zila Parishad Chairman or a member of Zila Parishad representing the Chairman, Lead Bank and NABARD. Director, MANAGE will be the chairman of the team. A quorum of three members will suffice. Recommended Institutions shall make a presentation before a panel of MANAGE faculty, Representative of NABARD, Directors of Department of Agriculture of State concerned, ICAR Zonal Project Director (or his nominee) and DAC representative. Selection of NTIs shall be based on the criteria given in Annexure-III.

      4. At the time of signing Agreement with MANAGE, Institutes from the private or non-government sector will give a Bank Guarantee for an amount of Rs.2.5 lakh so as to ensure expenditure as per norms during training and proper hand-holding after the training. All the NTIs shall install web cameras in the class rooms for use by any of the monitoring agencies.

   2. Process of Selection of Candidates

      1. Call for applications from eligible candidates: Advertisement in local newspapers will be issued under intimation to local employment exchanges separately by the NTI. The NTIs may also give publicity to

   the scheme through Doordarshan, AIR, Private Television and Radio channels, ATMAs, Agricultural Universities, ICAR Institutions, KVKs, Banks, Agriculture Graduate Associations, Agri-Business Companies, Agriculture and allied departments, network of trained / established Agri-preneurs, posters, leaflets etc. Besides, NTIs may adopt any innovative method for giving publicity about the scheme. Candidates can apply in the format prescribed in Annexure-IV to the NTIs personally or by post.

      2. Online applications: In order to encourage submission of applications by candidates for training without personally visiting NTIs for completing enrolment formalities, MANAGE will develop a mechanism for submitting applications online, through its website [http://www.agriclinics.net/onlineform.htm.](http://www.agriclinics.net/onlineform.htm)

      3. Selection of candidates:

1) Scrutiny of applications of short-listed candidates meeting the prescribed qualifications will be done jointly by an official of Nodal Training Institute (NTI) and any one official from ATMA/Block Technology Team/ State Agriculture and allied departments. For this purpose, NTI will coordinate with Project Director, ATMA.

2) Eligible candidates will be called for an interview. The Interview Committee will consist of representatives from NTI, MANAGE, KVK, NABARD, Bank, State Agriculture / allied departments, and an Agri Business Company in the area (if any). Besides NTI, presence of at least three officials is necessary to make the minimum quorum of the interview committee. NTI shall request the offices concerned in writing with proper notice.

3) The candidates will be selected based on pre-determined criteria and weightage (Annexure-V).  
4) To select the most eligible and genuine candidates for undergoing training under the Scheme, NTIs should ensure at

   least 60	applications	are	considered	by	the	Screening Committee. Each batch shall not exceed 35 candidates.

   3. Training Allotment and its Implementation:

      1. After signing MOU with MANAGE as per the standard format available in [http://www.agriclinics.net/mou.htm,](http://www.agriclinics.net/mou.htm) NTIs will advertise in local media to seek applications from the eligible candidates. After getting sufficient number of applications (at least 60), each NTI will seek allotment of training programme from MANAGE to initiate the screening process of eligible candidates and selecting them (as per para 4.2.3). This selection process has to be completed within 30 days of allotment. The Screening Committee report, applications of selected candidates and application fee have to be sent to MANAGE immediately after completion of screening and selection.

      2. On the day of inauguration of training programme, NTI will send inauguration report, list of candidates \[with their addresses (which should also show distance from training venue), phone numbers and e-mail\] and weekly training schedule for release of first instalment of training funds and monitoring by MANAGE/DOE. The training schedule of two months programme should be as per standards	([http://www.agriclinics.net/scheme-training.htm)](http://www.agriclinics.net/scheme-training.htm\)) developed by MANAGE. Names of resource persons for each session should be clearly mentioned in the Training Schedule. The travel expenses incurred by the candidate for reaching the training institute and for returning home after training will be borne by the candidate only.

      3. Two months training programme aims at transforming persons qualified in the field of agriculture and allied sectors into agri- entrepreneurs. It is an intensive capacity building effort by the NTI faculty in association with locally available experts and successful

   agri-entrepreneurs. The training programme is divided	into two categories of activities:

         1. Exposing the trainees into potential agri-ventures in their area and providing additional subject matter training to refresh their knowledge and skills. Besides motivation, training will also concentrate on building communication skills, record maintenance, schemes/ programmes from where financial assistance is available etc. For instance, trainees interested in setting up Soil Testing Laboratories, Small Scale Bio-inputs Preparation Units, Custom Hiring of Machineries will be imparted requisite skills and knowledge. The basic idea is to customize the trainings modules based individual and collective needs of the entire group while adhering to the prescribed syllabi which is available at [www.agriclinics.net/](http://www.agriclinics.net/) .

         2. Facilitate the trainees to choose a venture and to prepare DPR based on market survey, hands on experience with the support of experienced bankers. Detailed interactions should be arranged with stakeholders such as farmers, bankers, department officials, input dealers, NGOs working in the area. Identification and analysis of farmers’ problems and provision solutions through extension and business advisories are focused upon. Assessing technical feasibility and financial viability of ventures, hands-on interface with the successful entrepreneurs and DPR preparation with assistance by experienced bankers as resource persons are the other crucial parts of this activity.

      4. MANAGE will coordinate scheduling of training in each NTI by sanctioning one or more batches simultaneously depending on the availability of selected candidates, infrastructure and logistic facilities.

      5. The threshold percentage for success rate for awarding another course to the same NTI shall be 37% overall and 45% during the past one year. However, such a cut-off percentage shall be progressively increased to attain the target of 50% by the year 2011-12. This threshold may be further increased subsequently. Based on documentation prescribed for assessing the success rate, verification shall be carried out by any two members of the team mentioned at para 4.1.1 above (nominees of sufficiently senior levels will also be permissible for this purpose) based on the record available in NTI. This team of two or members shall also consider periodic & surprise inspection reports while recommending sanction of another course. One such report is mandatory at the end of the year to extend training to the next year.

      6. The NTIs shall also send following reports to MANAGE (As per formats available in [www.agriclinics.net](http://www.agriclinics.net/) ):  
1) In addition to the final feedback as per (iv) below, feedback shall be given by every trainee at least twice during the training period (with a gap of at least two weeks in feedbacks by the same candidate) in the web-based interface provided for this purpose. Such feedbacks shall begin from 10 days after commencement of the course.

2) Final list of candidates in the prescribed format after one month of commencement of training.  
3) During the last week of Training, NTIs will guide and ensure that each trained candidate prepares a Detailed Project Report (DPR) and submit the DPR to the Bank in their area of operation for financial assistance.

4) After Completion of training, report on valediction with final feedback of participants.  
5) Status of the projects submitted to banks, periodically on a web- based form [http://www.agriclinics.net/login.asp](http://www.agriclinics.net/login.asp)

6) Success / failure stories as and when documented by NTI.

   7. The certificates would be issued by MANAGE to the successful participants through NTIs.

   4. Revised Training Cost

      1. The revised training cost per trainee shall be limited to Rs.35,000/- as depicted in Annexure-VI. An additional amount of 10% of approved charges on food, accommodation, honorarium, training expenditure and handholding charges has been provided for North-Eastern States and Hill States (J\&K, Uttarakhand & Himachal Pradesh).

   5. Release of Funds to Nodal Training Institutes

      1. Release of first instalment of training fund: First instalment of the training fund i.e. 60 percent of the total eligible training fund shall be released to the Public NTIs on receipt of Screening Committee report, applications and application fee. For Private NTIs, release of first instalment would be done after receiving the inauguration report, in addition to the above.

      2. Release of second instalment of training fund: Second instalment of the training fund i.e. remaining 40 percent or the eligible expenditure, whichever is less, shall be released on completion of training programme after receipt of expenditure statement. In case of Public NTIs, second instalment shall be released on receipt of final list of participants, one month after the start of the training.

      3. Utilization Certificate for Training Fund: Expenditure Statement shall be submitted by the NTI immediately after completing the programme. Utilisation Certificate, duly signed by a certified Chartered Accountant (competent Finance Department Official in case of Public Institutions) has to be submitted within a fortnight of receiving the second instalment or completion of training, whichever is later in the format available at [http://www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/trainguc-](http://www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/trainguc-)

   general.pdf for general category and [http://www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/traininguc-](http://www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/traininguc-) ne-hillystates.pdf for North East and hilly states.

      4. Admission of Expenditure: The utilisation certificate shall be admitted by MANAGE as per the cost norms of ACABC or actual expenditure claimed whichever is less. NTIs must maintain records related to actual number of candidates who are not staying in the training institute/hostel. Such candidates have to be considered as Day- Scholars and to be reported to MANAGE as per Annexure VII. Any deviation in the admission of the expenditure against the amount claimed in the Utilisation Certificate will be informed to NTI by MANAGE. Any unspent or un-admitted amount shall be returned by NTI within a fortnight from receipt of the communication in this regard from MANAGE. MANAGE shall withhold the release of further funds to NTIs which do not adhere to the above guidelines, besides recovering the excess from Bank Guarantee.

      5. Release of Handholding Fund:

         1. Half of the handholding amount i.e. Rs.2500/- per trained candidate shall be released to the NTI on receipt of list of projects submitted to bank (for candidates who intend to establish the venture with bank finance) along with proof of submission. NTIs must submit Utilisation Certificate for this amount within a year from the date of completion of respective training programmes as per the format available at [http://www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/handholdinguc-allcategories.pdf](http://www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/handholdinguc-allcategories.pdf)

         2. 	Remaining 50 percent of the handholding amount i.e. Rs.2500/- per established candidate shall be released to NTI on receipt of proof for Agri-Venture establishment. The second instalment is given as an incentive and NTI’s are required to give receipt to MANAGE for accounting purpose and Utilization Certificate is not needed. In case of self financed  Agri-Ventures,  NTIs  may claim full  handholding

      amount	on	submission	of	proof	for	Agri-venture establishment.

      6. Incentives to Candidates and NTIs

         1. NTIs with cumulative and respective batch success rate of more than 50 percent are eligible to get an additional incentive of Rs.2000/- per candidate for every candidate established after 50% success rate, reported in respective batch. NTIs shall submit receipt to MANAGE for accounting purpose and Utilization Certificate is not needed for this amount.

         2. 	Every candidate who establishes his/her venture and submits proof to that effect is eligible to receive an incentive of Rs.1000/- . This incentive amount may be sent through demand draft or crossed cheque to the candidate through respective NTI on submission of Advance Receipt to MANAGE.

         3. As handholding and reporting the progress are continuous activities, MANAGE may release the handholding amount to NTIs on bi-monthly basis.

      7. Payment of handholding charges to another NTI

         1. 	Presently, the Training Institutes where the candidates undergo training receive the handholding charges. For some reasons (e.g. distance, inactive NTIs etc), the NTI which trains a particular candidate might not have been able to submit the DPR or successfully complete the handholding support leading to setting up of venture. While such handholding is to be provided for one year, a trained candidate may know whether the handholding is on the right track.

         2. 	If a venture is not successfully established within one year and the candidate feels that this has happened due to the lack of appropriate handholding by NTI that trained him, he may opt for subsequent handholding by a different NTI. In such a case, full handholding amount of Rs.5000/- (where even the first instalment would not have been disbursed due to non-submission of DPRs) or 2nd instalment of Rs. 2,500/- shall be paid to such another NTI, which will be considered for handholding charges only after the trained candidate expresses his willingness to get associated with such other NTI in writing to MANAGE. Besides this, the NTI which is willing to provide handholding to a candidate not trained by it has to convey its willingness to MANAGE in writing to provide handholding. Confirmation about setting up of a successful venture as a sequel to such handholding by another NTI will be reported in the prescribed format. The above steps will ensure non-duplication of payment to more than one NTI. Responsibility of handholding of candidates trained by NTIs, which have been subsequently declared as inactive, may be given to willing/active NTIs in respective States.

      8. Criteria for declaring Recognized NTI as Inactive NTI

1. Not conducting any programme during the last one year

2. Cumulative Success rate below 35% (except NTIs in J\&K and N- E States)  
3. Not starting training within six months from the date of signing MOU  
4. Not providing handholding activities as per guidelines

5. Default in submitting UCs for more than a year (to be declared inactive only after receiving UCs)  
6. Violating the norms of MOU or these instructions.

   Any one of the criteria is sufficient to consider any NTI as inactive.

   6. Certificates to successful ventures:

Certificates are being issued to trainees by MANAGE after successful completion of two month training. It has been decided that successfully established ventures will a get a certificate recognizing that their enterprise is set up under the Scheme. Such certificates will be issued to ventures after verification and recommendation by PD, ATMA, Programme Coordinator of KVK or Head of nearest Research Station of State Agriculture University/ICAR institute as per the following procedure.

* On establishing the venture and running it successfully (including provision of extension services) for at least 6 months, the candidates will seek the certificate from MANAGE through respective NTI by submitting the verification report and recommendation to MANAGE as above.  
* Certificates consisting Candidate’s ID No. and venture details will be issued by MANAGE indicating the date on which verification was conducted.

This certificate entitles the agri-preneurs to be recognised by the Development Departments in supplementing the efforts of public extension services. Proof of establishment of venture will be provided in the format given in Annexure VIII.

7. Refresher & Sensitisation Trainings

   1. About 500 selected agri-preneurs will undergo refresher training every year. This training of about 3-5 days duration may be conducted  in  specialized  Institutions  like  SAUs/ICAR  Institutes

   /IIMs/IITs/CSIR Institutes /DST Institutes/ reputed Private/Non- governmental Institutions. Detailed financial norms for refresher courses under ACABC Scheme are given at Annexure-IX.

      2. NABARD will organize sensitization training/workshops to motivate the bankers across the country to provide credit to Agri-

   preneurs for establishing ventures. Budget of Rs.25 lakh per year has been provided to NABARD for the purpose. NABARD will submit details of cost norms, numbers of courses, duration and officers to be

| trained.  NABARD | will  necessarily  inform | MANAGE  and  DAC  for |
| :---- | :---- | ----- |
| participation	of | their	representatives | in	such	sensitization |
| programmes. |  |  |

5. CREDIT SUPPORT

   1. Linkage with Credit

      1. Assistance under the scheme would be purely credit linked and subject to sanction of the project by banks based on economic viability and commercial considerations. The eligible financial institutions under the scheme are:

1) Commercial Banks

2) Regional Rural Banks

3) State Cooperative Banks

4) State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks

5) Such other institutions eligible for refinance from NABARD.

   2. Project Cost Ceiling

      1. Ceiling of project cost for subsidy has been enhanced to Rs.20 lakh for an individual project (Rs. 25 lakh in case of extremely successful individual projects) and to Rs.100 lakh for a group project (established by a group comprising at least five trained persons under the Scheme, out of which one could be from Management background). The banks may, nevertheless, subject to their own satisfaction, finance groups formed by 2 or more trained persons under the Scheme (person with management background can only be included in groups of 5 or more) within the TFO ceiling of Rs.20 lacs per trained person and overall ceiling of Rs.100 lacs, whichever is less, for the purpose of subsidy. However, the actual credit sanctioned by the banks for a venture established under the Scheme could be higher

   depending on the financial viability and technical feasibility. Thus, for instance, if an individual is granted a loan for TFO of Rs.35 lacs, subsidy shall be reckoned only on TFO of Rs.20 lacs.

      2. To encourage exceptionally successful individual agri-preneurs, the project cost limit for subsidy purposes may be extended by Rs.5 lakh in addition to the generally applicable project cost limit of Rs.20 lakh for calculating subsidy. This will serve as an incentive to an agri- preneur to expand his/her already established and successful venture. Format for considering such cases is given on the MANAGE website	[http://www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/Annexure-XVII.pdf.](http://www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/Annexure-XVII.pdf) Such cases are to be approved by the Empowered Steering Committee using the criteria given at Annexure X based on the recommendation of the Banker and ATMA official.

      3. In order to provide extension services using web-enabled resources of DAC and other agencies, computer, printer and broadband connection (1 mbps at least) should be an integral part of TFO.

   3. Term Loan:

      1. The term loan would be composite in nature and participating bank(s) would extend bank loan as per the TFO, which would includes fixed capital cost and working capital for one operating cycle. Loan sanctioned will be the differential amount between TFO and margin money.

      2. Composite Subsidy will be provided even for low capital investment cases has been introduced (for cases sanctioned by banks on or after 04.08.2010) as it is definitely possible that some agri- preneurs already have capital (e.g. a building) to start a venture, thereby requiring minimal capital investment. At least 10% value of

   the Total Financial Outlay of the project should be in capital form.

      3. The repayment schedule will be drawn on the total amount of the loan (including subsidy) in such a way that the subsidy amount is adjusted after liquidation of net bank loan (excluding subsidy).

      4. Repayment period will depend on the nature of activity and will vary between 5 to 10 years. The repayment period may include a maximum grace period of 2 years (to be decided by the financing bank as per needs of individual projects).

      5. Rate of interest on term loan shall be as per RBI guidelines and declared policy of the bank in this regard. Interest would be chargeable on borrower’s accounts as per RBI/Bank’s policy.

   4. Margin Money

      1. The stipulations on margin money shall be in accordance with the guidelines of Reserve Bank of India issued from time to time. In case of loans up to Rs. 5 lakh, no margin money is required as per present norms.

      2. The margin money to be contributed by the general category entrepreneur will be as per prevailing norms. However, concessions would be made in respect of SCs/STs, women and beneficiaries of North-Eastern States, Hill areas. In such cases, a maximum of 50% of the margin money prescribed by banks could be given by NABARD to meet the shortfall in borrower’s contribution, if the bank is satisfied that the borrower is unable to meet the margin money requirements. Such assistance to banks by NABARD will be without any interest. The banks may, however, levy a service charge up to 2% per annum from the borrowers.

5. Security

As most of the eligible activities pertain to agricultural input supply and services and the cost of investment will be less than Rs.25 lakh in most cases, the security norms applicable to tiny industries as prescribed in RBI circular No.RPCD.PLNFS.BC.65/06.02.31/99-2000 dated 31.3.2000 would be made applicable to these units. Accordingly, up to a loan amount of Rs.5 lakh, the loans can be secured against hypothecation of assets created and no further security would be necessary.

6. Time limit for completion of the project

   1. Time limit for completion of the project would be as envisaged under the project, subject to maximum of 6 months period from the date of disbursement of the first installment of loan by financial institution, which may be extended by a further period of 6 months, if reasons for such delay are considered justifiable by the financial institution concerned.

      2. If the project is not completed within the stipulated period, benefit of subsidy shall not be available and advance subsidy placed with the participating bank, if any, will have to be refunded forthwith to NABARD.

   7. Other Conditions

      1. The participating banks will adhere to the norms of appraising the projects regarding technical feasibility and commercial/financial viability.

      2. The participating banks should ensure insurance of the assets created under the project, wherever required statutorily. If beneficiary

   opts to buy insurance on these assets, even if insurance is not required statutorily, such expenditure will be an eligible component of the TFO.

      3. A sign board displaying “Assisted under the Scheme of Agri- Clinics and  Agri-Business  Centres,  Ministry  of  Agriculture, Government of India” will be exhibited at the unit.

      4. Pre and post completion inspection of the project shall be undertaken by the participating bank to verify physical, financial and operational progress as and when required.

   8. Refinance Assistance form NABARD

NABARD will provide refinance assistance to commercial banks, RRBs, SCBs, SCARDBs and other such eligible institutions at the rate of 100% of the amount financed by the banks as term loan. Rate of interest on refinance will be as decided by NABARD from time to time.

6. SUBSIDY

   1. Eligibility for Subsidy

      1. In the Pre-revised Scheme, subsidy was admissible in respect of agriculture graduates trained under ACABC scheme on or after April 1, 2004, for fresh investments made after July 9, 2006\. The candidates trained under the Scheme prior to April 1, 2004 who have made investments after July 9, 2006, were to be considered on a case by case basis. Subject to fulfilment of all other eligibility conditions under the scheme, a Committee headed by Director General (DG), National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management (hereinafter referred to as MANAGE) used to take a decision in such matters. However, very few such cases have been received in MANAGE since it

   was set up, mainly due to ignorance among candidates and financing institutions and distance of MANAGE from their place of operation.

      2. Therefore, it has been decided to remove this cut-off date of April 1, 2004 *qua* the training date and henceforth all candidates trained under the scheme shall be eligible for subsidy with respect to investments made after July 9, 2006 (applicable to loan accounts sanctioned on/or after this date). As agreed in the Review Meeting held on 09.11.2010, trained candidates whose knowledge acquired during the training might have become obsolete due to passage of time, may undergo a refresher course. Whether or not a candidate trained sufficiently long time ago needs his skills to be upgraded by refresher courses, shall be decided by the Selection Committee for candidates at the NTI level. However, need for such refresher trainings shall not be considered, if the training has been within 5 years before date of loan application. Funds for such skill upgradation courses can be pooled from various resources including MANAGE coordination charges, savings from funds allocated for refresher courses and budget earmarked for advertisement and publicity of ACABC Scheme with DOE.

      3. The trained candidates could also undertake group projects. If the group consists of a total of five or more persons trained under the scheme, all except one of them would have to be from among the eligible categories mentioned under para 3 and the remaining person could be non-agriculture graduate with experience in business development and management.

      4. Delivery of extension services shall be the main component of ACABC projects for availing of the benefit of subsidy under the Scheme.

2. Linking Subsidy Adjustment to Delivery of Extension Services

   1. Adequate safeguards are put in place to ensure providing extension services necessarily by the agri-preneurs to their clients. In particular, payment of back-ended subsidy will be linked to extension services provided by the agri-preneurs. For this purpose, any two out of a group of rank and status not below the following officials / persons would make a periodic / surprise inspection at least on a quarterly basis and submit its report to NABARD / financing bank / office of ATMA. Record of advisory services provided to farmers by the agri-preneurs as per the format given at Annexure XI may form the basis for providing the report.

1) Block Technology Manager/Subject Matter Specialists under ATMA  
2) Chairman (or his nominee), ATMA Block Famers’ Advisory Committee

3) Panchayat Members

4) NABARD / Bank official

5) Block level officer of State Department of Agriculture and allied sectors.

   2. The financing bank will consider the periodic or surprise visit reports mentioned above while adjusting the back-ended composite subsidy to the agri-preneur under this Scheme. A consolidated report has to be finalized before the expiry of three years lock-in period. The financing bank has to send the report to the NABARD and ATMA for information. The report may highlight nature of enterprise initiated by agri-preneur, its coverage / reach, impact on income of agri-preneur, impact on farmers and agricultural development in the area.

      3. States are encouraged to provide information on all government policies, programmes, schemes etc to agri-preneurs and also use their services in implementation of extension activities funded by the government.

   3. Change of Capital & Interest Subsidy to Composite Subsidy

      1. Subsidy pattern has been revised from “capital and interest subsidy” to “Composite Subsidy” which will be back-ended in nature. It will be 44% of project cost for women, SC/ST & all categories of candidates from NE and Hill states and 36% of project cost for all others. Interest subsidy scheme is replaced with enhanced quantum of back-ended subsidy.

      2. The subsidy admissible under the scheme will be kept in the “Subsidy Reserve Fund Account” (Borrower-wise) in the books of the financing bank. No interest will be charged on this by the bank. In view of this, for the purposes of charging interest on the loan component, the subsidy amount should be excluded. The balance lying to the credit of the “Subsidy Reserve Fund Account” will not form part of Demand and Time Liabilities. NABARD will ensure that the banks do not charge interest on subsidy portion of the loan, as back- ended subsidy is released to banks up-front.

      3. In all new cases, subsidy will be released as Composite Subsidy (Annexure XIII). The subsidy in all such cases will be worked out on the basis of the Fixed Capital and one Operating Cycle of the Working Capital as a Composite Loan. Loan / subsidy (i.e. capital and interest) cases sanctioned so far (but not yet closed) shall be converted to Composite Subsidy regime and the differential amount between the Composite Subsidy and subsidy already released shall be paid to the agricultural entrepreneur (agri-preneurs) as per the Scheme Guidelines (Annexure XIV). Entrepreneurs whose loan accounts have been closed can avail fresh loan to expand the project activity or start

   a new venture under the scheme in which case the TFO for subsidy calculation be limited to Rs.20 lakh (Rs 25 lakh in case of extremely successful) Individual project and Rs.100 lakh for Group project (Annexure XV). Following criteria shall be taken into consideration while implementing the above instructions:

1. Revised guidelines on TFO ceiling, revised rates of subsidy etc., would be applicable only for cases sanctioned by banks on or after August 4, 2010\.

2. ‘Not yet closed’ would be interpreted as ‘all cases where at least an installment of subsidy (capital or interest) is yet to be released by NABARD and those cases where full subsidy (capital and interest) has been released but loan account is not closed (i.e. not fully repaid) as on 04 August, 2010\. However, the loan accounts (not closed) which are NPA as on August 4, 2010 will not be eligible for composite subsidy (only those who are regular in repayment should get the benefit of subsidy).

3. Although subsidy at enhanced rates will be available for projects where bank loan was sanctioned prior to August 4, 2010 (but after July 9, 2006\) they will not be eligible for higher TFO ceiling.

   4. The cases where capital subsidy has been disbursed but interest subsidy is yet to be disbursed or vice-versa, as per the pre- revised scheme, such cases will be reopened and balance of composite subsidy as per the modified guidelines will be released in one lump- sum by NABARD to the concerned bank. Regional Offices of NABARD would obtain a claim for balance subsidy in such cases and sanction the same in the format given at Annexure XIV.

      5. Candidates trained under this Scheme can avail subsidy from any Scheme of Central or State Government related to his/her field of agri-business, if it is beneficial to the candidate. However, subsidy for the same project cannot be availed from more than one Scheme by a candidate.

      6. Sometimes entrepreneurs start small and then ramp up their business later on. Therefore, it has been decided that the benefit of subsidy will be extended up to 2 times to a candidate under the Scheme as per the approved rates mentioned at 6.3.1 of the project cost of Rs 20/25 lacs or Rs 100 lacs as the case may be. Such cases may include cases where the project is expanded in phases or financed in phases. However, if an existing venture is expanded or financed in phases, Composite Subsidy limits shall be reckoned only on such incremental component of Total Financial Outlay. Following are the cases where such a facility can be availed:

1. When two independent projects are financed to same beneficiaries

2. When an existing project (that has availed subsidy under the scheme) is undergoing expansion.

   However, in all such cases the maximum amount of subsidy shall be limited to the stipulated TFO ceiling (for both projects put together). In case of expansion of an existing venture, composite subsidy shall be computed only on the TFO for expansion. This will not include the project cost of the existing project.

3. If the fresh /expansion of project is sanctioned by the bank before August 4, 2010, the TFO ceiling of Rs.10.00 lakh (pre- revised) will be applicable. The TFO ceiling of Rs.20.00 lakh (revised) would be applicable only for fresh/ expansion of project sanctioned by the bank on or after August 4, 2010\.

   7. The subsidy will be back \- ended with minimum 3 years lock- in period. This implies that once the loan is taken with subsidy, the account cannot be closed within three years.

      8. The subsidy, which is back ended, will be admissible only if all repayments till date had been made.

      9. The subsidy will be adjusted in one lump-sum against the last remaining installments of repayment of bank loan

      10. Banks should prescribe interest rates as per declared policy of the bank for the relevant sector, at the time of sanction of loan amount.

   4. Procedure for release of subsidy

      1. An interested Agri-entrepreneur will submit the project proposal for term loan and subsidy to the bank on an application form as prescribed by the bank concerned along with the project report and other documents for appraisal and sanction of loan.

      2. After sanction of the project and disbursal of first installment of loan, the bank will furnish a brief project profile-cum-claim form for subsidy in the prescribed format along with a copy of bank’s sanction letter to the Regional office of NABARD (Annexure XIII, XIV, XV).

      3. Subsidy will be deposited by NABARD with the disbursing bank upfront (i.e. eligible subsidy amount in one instalment based on Subsidy claim submitted by financing bank / branch to NABARD Regional Office immediately after loan is sanctioned).

      4. The subsidy amount will be placed with NABARD H.O. in advance by the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Govt. of

   India. The NABARD shall authorize its Regional Offices for speedy disposal of claims submitted by Banks, but within a fortnight of receipt of claims from Banks.

      5. After crediting the subsidy in the Subsidy Reserve Fund Account of the borrowers under the Scheme, a Utilization Certificate (Annexure-XVI/XVII) in the prescribed format shall be submitted by the participating bank to NABARD to the effect that the amount of subsidy received by them has been fully utilized and adjusted in the books of account as per the sanctioned terms and conditions of the project within the overall guidelines of the scheme.

   6.4.6 With reference to para 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 it may be clarified that in case unsatisfactory report is recorded during periodic/ surprise visits or where misutilization of subsidy has been noticed the financing bank shall refund the subsidy to NABARD for remitting to the GOI.

   5. NABARD shall not to be required to pay interest on the amount of advance subsidy placed with them.

   6. Submission of Subsidy claim Status from NABARD

Details of subsidy released shall be provided by NABARD on monthly interval in the format (Annexure XII) prescribed for the purpose. Details include advance/final/total amount of subsidy and interest subsidy amount released to Banks. NABARD shall enter subsidy release status (total eligible amount, amount deposited in bank, date of release etc) by updating each individual case in the website being maintained by MANAGE [http://www.agriclinics.net/login.asp](http://www.agriclinics.net/login.asp)
