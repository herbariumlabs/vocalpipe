# **National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)**

(Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change)

December 01, 2021

Climate change1 is one of the most critical global challenges of our times. Recent events have emphatically demonstrated our growing vulnerability to climate change. Climate change impacts will range from affecting agriculture – further endangering food security – to sea- level rise and the accelerated erosion of coastal zones, increasing intensity of natural disasters, species extinction, and the spread of vector-borne diseases.

# **Introduction**

The vulnerability assessment and adaptation studies of climate change were made in various areas such as water resources, agriculture, forests, natural eco-systems, coastal zones, health energy and infrastructure as a part of the [Initial National Communication of India](https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/indnc1.pdf)2 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Further, the Expert Committee on Impact of Climate Change set up by the Ministry of Environment & Forests in June 2007 assessed the impact of climate change on six areas, namely water resources, agriculture, Natural Ecosystem, Health, Coastal Zone Management and Climate modelling. Reports of the Expert Committee were then prepared and a range of policies and programmes were initiated to address the problem of climate change in the context of sustainable development.

1. # **What is the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)?**

   The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) [was released by the Prime](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/erelcontent.aspx?relid=44098) [Minister on 30th June 2008\.](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/erelcontent.aspx?relid=44098)3 It outlines a national strategy that aims to enable the country to adapt to climate change and enhance the ecological sustainability of India‘s development path. It stresses that maintaining a high growth rate is essential for increasing living standards of the vast majority of people of India and reducing their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.

   There are eight ―National Missions‖ which form the core of the National Action Plan. They focus on promoting understanding of climate change, adaptation and mitigation, energy efficiency and natural resource conservation.‖4

The [Principles of NAPCC](http://moef.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CC_ghosh.pdf)6 are:

* Protecting the poor through an inclusive and sustainable development strategy, sensitive to climate change  
* Achieving national growth and poverty alleviation objectives while ensuring ecological sustainability  
* Efficient and cost-effective strategies for end-use demand-side management  
* Extensive and accelerated deployment of appropriate technologies for adaptation and mitigation  
* New and innovative market, regulatory, and voluntary mechanisms for sustainable development

* Effective implementation through unique linkages – with civil society, LGUs, and public-private partnerships

4. # **What is the National Solar Mission (NSM)?**

   The [NSM was launched in January 2010](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1685046)7, with the objective of establishing India as a global leader in solar energy, by creating the policy conditions for solar technology diffusion across the country as quickly as possible.

   The initial target of NSM was to install 20 GW solar power by 2022\. This was upscaled to 100 GW in early 2015\. Numerous facilitative programmes and schemes under the Mission have driven the grid connected solar power installed capacity from

   25 MW in the year 2010-11 to about 36.32 GW as on 31st October 2020\. An additional 58.31 GW solar power capacity is currently under installation/ tendering process.

entitlements and pricing. It will seek to ensure that a considerable share of the water needs of urban areas are met through recycling of waste water, and ensuring that the water requirements of coastal cities with inadequate alternative sources of water are met through adoption of new and appropriate technologies such as low temperature desalination technologies that allow for the use of ocean water.

[NWM](http://nwm.gov.in/)13has identified five goals which are mentioned below:

* Comprehensive water data base in public domain and assessment of the impact of climate change on water resource  
* Promotion of citizen and state actions for water conservation, augmentation and preservation  
* Focused attention to vulnerable areas including over-exploited areas  
* Increasing water use efficiency by 20 per cent

10. # W**hat is the National Mission for a Green India?**

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved a proposal of the Ministry of Environment and Forests for a [National Mission for a Green India](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=103978)15(GIM) as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme.

GIM puts ―greening‖16 in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation. Greening is meant to enhance ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and storage (in forests and other ecosystems), hydrological services and biodiversity; as well as other provisioning services such as fuel, fodder, small timber and non- timber forest products (NTFPs).

The Mission aims at responding to climate change by a combination of adaptation and mitigation measures, which would help:

* Enhancing carbon sinks in sustainably managed forests and other ecosystems  
* Adaptation of vulnerable species/ecosystems to the changing climate  
* Adaptation of forest-dependent communities

# **The objectives of the Mission are:**

* Increased forest/tree cover on 5 m ha of forest/non-forest lands and improved quality of forest cover on another 5 m ha (a total of 10 m ha)  
* Improved ecosystem services including biodiversity, hydrological services and carbon sequestration as a result of treatment of 10 m ha

* Increased forest-based livelihood income of about 3 million households living in and around the forests

11. # **What is the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture?**

[National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1556469)17(NMSA) has been made operational from the year 2014-15, it aims at making agriculture more productive, sustainable, remunerative and climate resilient by promoting location specific integrated /composite farming systems; soil and moisture conservation measures; comprehensive soil health management; efficient water management practices and mainstreaming rain-fed technologies.

**Farm Water Management (FWM)** was implemented as one of the components of NMSA during 2014-15 with the objective of enhancing water use efficiency by promoting technological interventions like drip & sprinkler technologies, efficient water application & distribution system, secondary storage etc. Thereafter, these activities have been subsumed under the ‗**Per Drop More Crop (PDMC)**‘ component of **Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)** during 2015-16.

**Soil Health Management (SHM)** is one of the components under the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). SHM aims at promoting Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) through judicious use of chemical fertilizers including secondary and micro nutrients in conjunction with organic manures and bio-fertilizers for improving soil health and its productivity, strengthening of soil and fertilizer testing facilities to improve soil test based recommendations to farmers for improving soil fertility.

**“Soil Health Card” Scheme** has been under implementation in the country since February, 2015 to provide Soil Health Cards to all farmers in the country. Soil Health Card will provide information to farmers on soil nutrients status of their soil and recommendation on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and its fertility.

12. # **What is the National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change?**

The **National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change (NMSKCC)** seeks to build a vibrant and dynamic knowledge system that would inform and support national action for responding effectively to the objective of ecologically sustainable development.
