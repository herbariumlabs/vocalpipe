# Digital Agriculture Mission

Posted On: 11 FEB 2025 5:32PM by PIB Delhi

The government has approved the Digital Agriculture Mission on 2nd September 2024 with an outlay of Rs. 2817 Crore. An amount of Rs. 54.972 Cr has been allocated for the FY 2025-26. However, funds are released to the States including the state of Maharashtra based on their proposals. The Mission seeks to enable a robust digital agriculture ecosystem in the country for driving innovative farmer-centric digital solutions and making available timely and reliable crop- related information to all the farmers in the country. The Mission envisages the creation of Digital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture such as Agristack, Krishi Decision Support System, Comprehensive Soil Fertility & Profile Map and other IT initiatives undertaken by Central Government/State Governments. Agristack project is one of the major components of this Mission, which consists of three foundational registries or databases in the agriculture sector, i.e., the Farmers’ Registry, Geo-referenced village maps and the Crop Sown Registry, all created and maintained by the State Governments/ Union Territories. The government is providing administrative and technical support to all the states for implementation of the mission. AgriStack provides comprehensive and useful data on farmers' demographic details, land holdings, and crops sown, enabling farmers to digitally identify and authenticate them for accessing benefits and services such as credit, insurance, procurement etc. It also enables state to design solutions that open access for farmers to the digital economy such as Purchase and Sell of Inputs and Produce online in a trustful manner.
