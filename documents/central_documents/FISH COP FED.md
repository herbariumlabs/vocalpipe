India for implementation of Central Sector scheme 'National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen', in States/Union Territories during the financial year 2015-16 at an outlay of Rs.43.49 crore (Rupees Forty three crore and forty nine lakh only) as per newly approved pattern during the 12th plan. The components approved under the Scheme are i} Saving-cum Relief; ii) Development of Model Fishermen Villages; iii) Group Accident Insurance for active Fishermen and iv) Training & Extension.

National Scheme for the Welfare oLFishermen is the dedicated scheme for the welfare of fishermen in the Country that provides for minimum social security to the fishermen in the event of the occurrence of an accident while fishing and also provic\!es for relief measures to the poor fishermen during the  
   \_lean fishing session. The Scheme is also a unique scheme that makes provisions for low cost houses exclusively for the fishermen community. Government of India endeavors to extend benefits of the scheme to large number of fishermen in the country. The State/UT Governments are encouraged to submit proposals to cover as many fishermen possible during the financial year 2015-16 giving clue preference to Below Poverty Line (BPL), women and Scheduled Caste / Scheduled Tribe beneficiaries.

3. The Scheme is demand driven and will be implemented through respective State Government or its agencies. Expenditure on assistance will be shared on 50:50 basis by Government of India and State Governments in respect of all components of the scheme.

In case of North-Eastern States, the cost sharing would be 75:25 basis. For UTs, the entire expenditure is borne by the Government of India. In addition, States/UTs will be required to bear full cost of staff salary including any increase, maintenance of vehicle, office contingencies and acquisition of land etc. wherever necessary.

4. Details of the Scheme and Mode of its operation are at Annexure-I. Proposal(s) already sanctioned under this scheme are as per cost norms, existing at time of sanction of the proposal(s).

5. Proposals seeking central assistance under the scheme are to be submitted by States/UTs in the prescribed format and must be accompanied by detailed progress reports of projects sanctioned in preceding years and the Utilization Certificates in prescribed format. Reasons for shortfalls, if any, may be brought out clearly while providing the progress report. In addition, details of beneficiaries may also be furnished as per the enclosed format. Availability of budget provision in the State Budget for each component should be specifically indicated.

6. Under all the components of scheme, assistance in the form of grant-in-aid for identified activities shall be provided to an individual fishermen beneficiary, self-help groups, women fishermen groups, fishery cooperative societies.

7. It may be ensured that 16.2% and 8% of funds are targeted for SC & ST beneficiaries respectively under Scheduled Castes Special Plan (SCSP) as per the directives of Planning Commission. The SC beneficiaries may be both fishermen by caste and/or by profession. Also, 10% of funds should be earmarked for women beneficiaries. Accordingly, State Governments may ensure adequate numbers of such beneficiaries in their proposals.

**Annexure-1**

**Central Sector Scheme 'National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen'**

( **1\) Development of Model Fishermen Villages**

Under this component, eligible fishermen in inland and marine sector would be provided with basic civic amenities like houses, drinking water and a commonplace for recreation and work. The respective States/UTs shall provide land for development of these amenities. The States should keep the following criteria in view while selecting beneficiaries for allotment of houses under the scheme:-

1) Beneficiary should be an active fisher identified by State Government;

   2) 	Preference should .be given to fishers below poverty line and to landless fishers;  
      3) Fishers owning land  or  kutcha  structure may also  be considered  for

      allotment of houses under the scheme.

   Cost of development would be shared equally by Central Government and State Governments subject to the conditions indicated below. In case of North­ Eastern States, cost of the development would be shared by the Centre and North-Eastern States on 75:25 basis. In case of Union Territories, the entire expenditure shall be borne by Government of India.

   **(a)	Housing**

   A Fishermen Village may consist of not less than 10 houses. There is no upper limit for number of houses to be constructed in a village, which would depend on number of eligible fishermen in that village. However, State should ensure equitable distribution of houses among all villages in proportion to the number of eligible fishers, as, far as possible. The plinth area and cost of construction of a house would be limited to 35 Sq. mts and Rs. 75000 /- respectively. The ceiling on land and cost of construction indicate the upper limit. State Government may plan and ensure optimizing the use of available resources so that more number of houses could be built within the available resources.

   **b)	Drinking Water:**

   A fishermen village would be provided with one tubewell for every 20 houses. Where a village consists of only 10 houses or more, but less than 20 houses, one tubewell may be provided for such a village. The cost of installation of a tubewell should not exceed Rs.40,000 /-. However, for North-Eastern States, the cost of installation of a tubewell upto Rs. 45,000 /- would be permissible as  a  special  case  for  which  State  Government  should  furnish  adequate

   

   justification. The actual number of tubewells to be installed in a village may be rationalized on the basis of actual water requirement of the inhabitant families and the capacity of the tubewells. A fishermen village may be provided with alternative source of drinking water supply in case tubewells are not a practical proposition, provided the additional expenditure, (over and above what would otherwise be admissible if tubewells were to be provided on the basis *of* number of houses for which the facility is intended) is met entirely by the State Government.

   **(c)	Common Facility:**

   As a recreation and common working place, a fishermen village with at least 75 houses will be eligible to seek assistance for construction of a community hall if found necessary. The hall will be constructed on an area not exceeding 200 Sq. mts.	Two toilets, one for gents and one for ladies and a tubewelI will also be provided with a community hall.	The total cost of the hall should not exceed Rs.2,00,000 /-.	The	State/UTs	should	ensure	optimum	utilization	of	the community hall by permitting its utilization as a drying yard and also as mending shed.		If required, construction of walls for the community hall may be dispensed with so that it may be a structure with pillars and roofs to permit its optimum utilization as a common working place for fishermen.

2) **(i) Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen:**

   Under this component, fisherfolk/licensed/identified or registered with the State/UT Governments would be insured for Rs. 2,00,000/- against death or permanent total disability and Rs.1,00,000/- for partial permanent disability and a cover ofRs.10,000/- towards hospitalization expenses in the event of accident. The insurance cover will be for a period of 12 months artd a policy would be taken out by FISHCOPFED in respect of all the participating States/UTs.  The ann al premium payable would not exceed Rs.65 /- per head to be shared in the ratio of 50:50 between Central and State government.  In case of North-Eastern States, amount of premium would be shared by the Centre and the North-Eastern States on 75:25 basis. In the case of Union Territories, 100% premium will be borne by the Central Government.

   In case of those States/UTs, which subscribes to this \_component through FISHCOPFED the Central share of the assistance (75% in case of NER and 100% in case of UTs) wou.ld be released directly to FISHCOPFED\_and will not be routed, through States/UTs.  The State Governments should, however, ensure that their share of premium is sent to FISHCOPFED well before the due date of renewal of the policy. In case of those States/UTs who do not subscribe to this component through FISHCOPFED, the release of Central share would be restricted on the basis of annual premium that would be payable had the insurance been taken through FISHCOPFED or the actual p·remium, whichever is less.  No contribution will be collected from the fishermen.  The scheme

 


   

   would cover fishermen in both marine and inland sectors. FISHCOPFED will be the executing agency and would operate the Scheme through any Insurance Company /Companies in case of States/UTs, which opt to subscribe to the Scheme through FISHCOPFED. However, the Ministry may identify one or more channelizing agencies as per the requirements for the purpose of efficiency in service delivery.

   (ii)	**Grants-in-aid  to  FISHCOPFED:**

   FISHCOPFED is a National Level Federation engaged in welfare activities for fishermen, especially in the field of insurance and training. There is a need to strengthen this organization. keeping in view FISHCOPFED's national and regional presence and its significant role in implementing schemes for the welfare of fishermen. Keeping in view a provision for·grant-in-aid of Rs. 50.00 lakh per annum to FISHCOPFED has been made under the Scheme as per the 11th plan. Besides, FISHCOPFED would be encouraged to conduct skill based training programme for the traditional fishers through its own resources and/ or availing fund from other ongoing schemes.

3) **Saving-cum-Relief:**

   **Mode of implement\!l,tion:**

   This component will be implemented uniformly for both marine & inland fisherm n. Relief is to be given to fishermen uniformly for 3 months of fishing ban period while seeking saving from them for 9 months. The fishermen contribution will be Rs. 900 /- as in the case of marine fishermen under he existing scheme which would be collected over *.9-* period of 9 months. Contribution of Rs. 1800/- will be made by the Centre and the States on 50:50 basis. Thus the total contribution of Rs. 2700 /- will be distributed to the fishermen in 3 equal monthly installments of Rs. 900 /- each. In case of Union Territories, the contribution of Rs.1800/\- will be borne by the Centre only. In case of North\-Eastern States, the Governmental contribution of Rs.1800 /- will be shared by the Centre & the States on 75:25 basis i.e. Rs.1350/- by the Centre ang s.450 /- by a North-Eastern States.  The interest accrued on the saving of the fishermen will also be distributed with the 3rd installment.

   For purpose of this component, an eligible fisherman means a person who is professionally	engaged	in	full	time	fishing,	is	member	of	Cooperative Society /Federation/Welfare Society, lives below poverty line and is below 60 years of age. If any	member of a fishermen family has regular employment or indulges •in any other income generating activity, such family will not qualify to be beneficiary under this component. The president/Secretary of the Association shall collect the beneficiary contribution and entrust the same to an official of the  State/UT Administration who shall deposit the fund every

/

month in a Nationalized Bank in the name of Director of Fisheries of the respective State/UTs.	The Director of Fisheries will draw the money during the lean season and distribute it to the beneficiaries adding Centre and State contribution in three equal installments.	The States/UTs should ensure that under no circumstances collection of the beneficiary contribution is made in lump sum and also that the money is not distributed to the fishermen in lump sum.

If a Fishermen defaults in paying his contribution during the non-lean months, the Government's (both State and Centre) matching grant will be limited the number of months for which he has actually subscribed and will be refunded to the fishermen in equal installments during the lean months. The interest accrued will also be disbursed with the 3rd installment.

However, a default by any beneficiary in payment of monthly contribution, not exceeding beyond one month and twice during the fishing season, may be waived provided the amount is paid by the beneficiary with a default fee which is equal to the interest that would have otherwise accrued, had the contribution been paid on the due date(s).

Lean months in different States vary according to climatic conditions and monsoon weather. Therefore, Director of Fisheries of the respective States/UT's will have the discretion, based on the climatic changes and other valid reasons to decide which the lean months in a year are. However, lean months will be limited to only 3 months.

4) **Training & Extension:**

   The Training & Extension will be implemented as a component of the Central Sector Scheme- 'National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen'. The expenditure on the items as indicatefl in the enclosed statement (Annexure-II) will be shared on 50:50 basis between the Government of India and the State Governments. In case of North-Eastern States, the cost sharing would be 75:25 basis.  For Union Territories the entire expenditure will be borne by the Centre. FISHCOPFED will be treated at par with Union Territories for all the items of the Training & Extension component.	•
