Collectivizing the small tea growers, especially small and marginal farmers, into producer organizations and producer companies has emerged as one of the most effective pathways to address the many challenges faced by the small growers’ sector and most importantly, improved access to investments, technology, inputs and markets. It is thus imperative for Tea Board to build a prosperous and sustainable small tea sector by promoting and supporting member-owned Producer Organizations and companiesthat enable small tea growers to move to a higher plane through efficient, cost-effective and sustainable resource use and realize higher returns for their produce**.** The primary objective of federating the SHGs and moving them higher up the value chain through FPO formation is to enhance production, productivity, profitability of the small growers (in the participating SHGs) and quality of tea produced in various tea growing regions across the country. The Farmers Producers’ Organisation can be registered as a society/ cooperative society/ producer company or any other legal entity which provides for sharing of profits / benefits amongst

the grower members. The SHG being an informal body, it shall have a compulsory stipulation of registering as a Farmers Producers organization under a legal provision on the inclusion of more than 20 members.

The typical services that a FPO needs to provide include the various aspects of cultivation (field inputs, cultivation techniques and processing knowhow in factory) along with helping them in getting market access. In addition, the FPO should allow the member SHGs (or the member small growers) to use the common infrastructure for transportation, weighing, processing, packaging, value addition, storage and any other logistics facilities which are essential in the tea value chain. Apart from that the FPO should also act as agents for knowledge dissemination about various aspects of tea cultivation, processing and marketing.

FPOs / FPCs may be federated in any of the following structures:

* Two or more SHGs with a total of more than 20 members coming together to form an FPO

* A single SHG with more than 20 members

* A single SHG with more than 20 members and additional individual small tea growers having Tea Board identification card / UIN  
* Multiple SHGs with additional individual small tea growers having Tea Board identification card / UIN  
* However, depending on the need and ground reality, the minimum number will be arrived at as per the discretion of Boards field Officer. There shall be no bar on the maximum number of members

The improvement of soil quality is critical to sustaining tea productivity and maintaining the soil health. Soil quality is the capacity to function effectively at present and in future use. Soil quality cannot be measured directly; it must be inferred from a wide range of soil quality properties (physical, chemical and biological) that influence the capacity of soil to perform effectively. Physico-chemical properties of soil samples are measured following the laboratory procedures.
