**PACKAGE OF PRACTICES FOR HORTICULTURAL CROPS**

**FRUIT CROPS**

# PINEAPPLE

_Ananas comosus_ L. Merr.

**Cultivar** : Kew, Queen and Mauritius

**Soil :** It can be grown on any type of well drained acidic soil.

**Propagation** : It can be propagated by sucker, slip and crown. These planting materials of 5-6 months age bear flowers after 12 months of planting except crowns which bear flowers after 19-20 months.

**Treatment of planting material** : Planting materials should be dipped in Mancozeb-75 WP (2 g/lit) before planting to protect the plants against bud rot.

**Time of planting** : April to October

**Planting and population :** Planting is done in two-row beds. In each bed, plant at 60 cm from row to row and at 30 cm from plant to plant. Distance between rows of two adjacent beds should be 90 cm. This will accommodate about 44,000 plants/ha.

**Manure and Fertilizer :** 10 to 15 t/ha of FYM may be applied at last ploughing. N, P2O5 and K2O @ 12g, 2g and 12g, respectively per plant per crop should be applied. Half of N and the whole of P2O5 and K2O are to be applied as basal dose and rest half of N to be applied as foliar spray.

For foliar applications, 450 g urea is dissolved in 10 lit of water and sprayed on 200 plants. It will provide 1 g of N per plant. Thus for giving 6 g of N as foliar application 6 such spraying are required after every 2 months. Soil application of 40 % of fertilizer of main crop i.e. 4.8 g N, 0.8 g, P2O5 and 4.8 g, K2O/plant after harvest of main crop increase production of ratoon crop of pineapple.

**Cultural operation :** Weeding should be done at least three to four times a year. Hand weeding can be partially eliminated by chemical weedicide. Diuron @ 3 kg/ ha as pre-emergence spray can be used economically in the first year to control broad spectrum of weeds in pineapple field. Black polythene (50 micron) can also be used for controlling weeds.

When there is long drought, irrigation may be given fortnightly.

To protect the fruits from sunburn, partial shade may be provided by planting arhar in between the beds. The spacing has to be adjusted accordingly. Covering the matured fruits with leaves adjacent to the fruits will reduce both sunburn and bird damage.

**Crop Cycle:** One main crop followed by two ratoons

### Flowering:

There are two main seasons of flowering- March-April and June-July. Sporadic flowering may take place in other periods also. Fruits usually ripen about 5 months after flowering.

### Regulation of flowering and early fruiting :

In general, when no special treatment is given, only 50-60% plants flower in main season.

With some chemical substances it is possible to get uniform flowering (over 80%) in the main season. For this purpose, Ethrel @ 100 ppm (10 ml in 100 lit. of water) solution should be applied to plants one month before flowering. About 30 ml of Ethrel solution should be poured on the core of the plant. Since Ethrel is a costly chemical one tenth of it can be made equally effective (1 ml in 100 lit) by adding 2% urea and 0.04% sodium carbonate or calcium carbonate.

To delay harvest by a few days (10-15 days) spray the fruit (just 60-70 days ahead of normal harvest) with 300 ppm Planofix.

To ripen the fruit earlier by about 10-15 days spray 500 ppm of Ethrel on the fruit about one month before normal harvest.

### Harvesting :

Harvesting is done when the fruits become yellow in colour. Over ripening on the mother plant or any injury to fruits at harvesting should be avoided. For distant market, the fruits may be harvested when they just change colour from green to yellow.

### Yield :

50-80 t/ha depending upon spacing and cultural practices

### Plant Protection :

_Leaf spot_: This can be controlled by spraying Mancozeb 75 WP (2 g/lit).

**Benefit: Cost ratio**: Main crop: 3.70; Ratoon crop: 8.50

# BANANA

_Musa_ spp. Colla

**Cultivar:** Dwarf : “Jahaji” (Dwarf Cavendish) Medium tall : “Chenichampa”

“Malbhog” “Bar Jahaji”

Tall : “Pura Kal” (Kach Kal) “Manohar”

“Jati” “Bhimkal”

**Soil:** Well drained friable loamy soil with adequate organic matter is ideal.

**Propagation** : It is propagated by sword suckers. Select healthy sword suckers and uproot with corm. Trim all the roots without damaging the buds. Give a slanting cut to the pseudostem 30cm above the base of the sucker. Weight of such planting materials should be around 1.5 kg to 2.0 kg.

45-60 days old tissue culture hardened plants (Dwarf Cavendish) can also be used as planting materials.

**Planting:** Planting is generally done in pits. Double planting (2 plants/pit) with a spacing of 1.8 m x 1.8 m for Jahaji gives higher yield.

For High density Planting 3 suckers per pit at 2m x 3m (5001 plants/ha) spacing should be planted. Pits should be filled up with 18 kg FYM along with top soil. Planting should be done 30 cm apart in the pit.

**Size of Pit** : 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm and 1m3 for high density planting.

**Spacing :** Dwarf cultivars: 1.8m x 1.8 m

Dwarf cultivars: 1.4 x 1.4 m (Without ratooning) Medium tall cultivars: 2.1m x 2.1m

Tall cultivars : 2.4 m x 2.4m

High density planting:

Jahaji : 1.0m x 1.2m x 2m (6250 plants/ha) Bar Jahaji: 1.2m x 1.8m (4629 plants/ha) Malbhog : 1m x 1.2m x 2m (6250 plants/ha)

**Time of planting**: March – May

### Manure and Fertilizer:

1.  12 kg FYM/plant, 110 g N/plant, 33 g P2O5/plant and 330 g K2O/plant
2.  For Integrated Nutrient Management of banana 12 kg FYM/plant, 55 g N/ plant, 33 g P2O5/plant, 330 g K2O/plant and 25g each of _Azospirillium_ and Phosphate Soluble Bacteria (PSB) per plant should be applied.
3.  For High Density Planting 18 kg FYM, 165 g N, 50 g P2O5, and 495 g K2O should be applied for 3 plants in each pit.

In case of Jahaji K2O may be increased upto 550 g/plant. In case of Barjahaji 200 g N/plant in three splits (3rd month, 5th month and shooting stage) should be applied.

FYM should be applied at the time of planting. The whole of P205, half on N and half of K2O should be applied in 3rd month of planting. The remaining N and K2O should be applied in 5th month of planting.

Soil application of different micronutrient mixture of B (6 g), Zn (9 g), Cu (6 g) and Mo (1 g) per plant for Borjahaji is beneficial. Micronutrient mixture of B, Zn, Cu & Mo at the same rate for Chenichampa and B & Zn mixture for Jahaji increase the production.

**Irrigation:** 3 irrigations per month during dry periods.

### Drip cum fertigation:

*   1.  Drip irrigation at 75% EpR during November to March can be applied for banana cultivar ‘ Barjahaji’ with Benefit: Cost ratio 5.72
    2.  75% recommended dose of N and K (82.5g N and 247.5g K) can be applied through drip.

### Intercultural:

**Desuckering :** Remove all the suckers till shooting and allow only one sword sucker at shooting to set as ratoon crop.

### Weeding :

Remove weeds as and when required. Diuron @ 3 kg/ha or Gramoxone @

1.5 kg/ha should be applied to check weed growth.

Grow one crop of cowpea and incorporation in soil followed by hand weeding at 30 days interval upto shoot stage.

**Bunch Covering** : White polythene bunch covering is suitable measure to overcome low temperature effect.

### Crop Cycle:

In a banana plantation one main crop followed by 2 ratoons should be allowed. However, in Kachkal 5 ratoons can be taken.

For high density planting, after harvesting of the main crop, new plantation should be done in between the rows. Preparation of the pits for planting should be done before harvesting of the main crop.

**Harvesting :** The fruit is harvested when the ridges on the surface of the skin change from angular to round, i.e. after the attainment of ¾ full stage. The dwarf bananas become ready for harvest within 11 to 14 months after planting, while tall varieties require about 14 to 16 months to harvesting.

**Yield :** The yield of banana depends on a number of factors such as variety, plant density, management practices etc. Tall varieties usually yield 15-20 t/ha. Dwarf varieties like Dwarf Cavendish yield 30-40 t/ha.

### Plant Protection:

1.  Corm borer and Nematodes: Healthy corms free from nematodes should be selected as planting materials. In case of infected suckers, the infected portions should be scraped out with a sharp knife. In such corms, carbofuran (Furadan) granules should be applied @ 40 g per corm after dipping in mud slurry.
2.  Pseudostem borer: Spray 0.1% malathion 50 EC (1 ml in 1 litre of water). Apply Carbofuran 3 g granules in soil @ 10 g per stool.
3.  Leaf & Fruit scarring beetle: Spray 0.1% malathion 50 EC (1 ml in 1 litre of water) on the bunches immediately after emergence or application of 0.05% monocrotophos @ 30 ml/plant. Baggings of bunch with muslin cloth or blue polyethylene before fruit set and remove after 60 days of fruit setting.
4.  Bunchy Top: To check the spread of the disease, the aphid vector should be controlled by spraying dimethoate or phosphamidon @ 1 ml/lit. (3 lit/ 25 plants) Uproot and bury the infected plants.
5.  Panama disease or Banana wilt: Soil drenching with 1.0% Bordeaux mixture or 0.05% carbendazim (0.5g in 1 litre of water) is effective.
6.  Sigatoka leaf spot: Spraying of Carbendazim at first appearance followed by 4 sprays at 30 days interval.

**Benefit: Cost ratio** : Main crop: 4.1; Ratoon crop: 6.5

# ASSAM LEMON

_Citrus limon_ L**.** Burm. F.

**Cultivar:** Assam Lemon (Local).

**Soil**: Loamy soil with uniform texture upto a depth of 3 m is ideal, for cultivation. Avoid waterlogged conditions.

### Propagation:

1.  Stem cutting
2.  Leaf bud cutting
3.  Air layering

### Stem cutting :

The cuttings are usually prepared from fully matured stem. The size of cutting is 18 to 20 cm in length with a thickness of lead pencil. The upper cut is made 1 cm above the node and lower cut close below the node in a slanting manner.

The cuttings are planted with a spacing of 30 cm x 30 cm in a slanting position in the nursery bed measuring 30 cm x 1 m x 10 m. The bed is prepared with a mixture of 1:1:1 decomposed cowdung, soil and sand respectively.

### Leaf-bud cutting :

Leaf-bud cutting should be taken from the branch having healthy well developed bud and actively growing leaves. The cuttings consist of a leaf blade and short piece of the stem measuring 2 cm.

The nursery bed should be prepared with a mixture of leaf-mould, soil and sand in a ratio of 3:2:1. The cuttings are planted in rows 15 cm x 25 cm spacing and buried upto 2/3rd to their length in a slanting position. Before planting, cutting should be treated with plant growth regulator, viz. IBA (500 ppm) or Seradex B. The sprouted cuttings can be transplanted within 1 year in the field.

### Air layering :

The first step in air layering is to remove completely a strip of bark 3 cm in width at a point 15cm or more below the tip end. Scraping the exposed surfaces to ensure complete removal of the phloem and cambium is desirable to retard healing. About one to two handful of only slightly moistened sphagnum moss or mud pudding with a mixture of well decomposed cowdung, soil and sand with a ration of 1:1:1, respectively is placed around the stem to cover the cut surface. Then a piece of polyethylene sheet 15 to 20 cm wide is wrapped carefully around the branch so that the sphagnum moss or mud is completely covered. Both the ends of the polyethylene sheet should be tied firmly so that the moss or mud does not dry up.

The best time for Stem cutting, Leaf-bud cuttings and Air layering is March- April. Stem cutting may be raised in polyethylene bags under partial shade as the best nursery techniques.

### Planting:

Before monsoon, pits of 0.5m x 0.5m size with a spacing of 3m x 3m are prepared and refilled with soil-manure mixture (1:1) and then allowed to settle. The time of planting is May to August.

### Pruning and Training:

In the nursery stage, pruning should begin soon after the seedlings start sprouting from the Stem cutting or Leaf bud cutting or Air layering. After planting in the main field, upto 50-60cm from the ground level all side branches should be removed keeping only single main trunk. Above 50-60cm, pruning is confined to the training to develop.

Mechanically strong trees with well spaced scaffold limbs before the onset of fruit setting. At the bearing stage, during winter when bearing of tree is low, the branches touching the ground should be cut close to the laterals without leaving any stub. All diseased, injured, cris-cross branches and water sprout should be removed.

### Manure and Fertilizer :

| Year | FYM | N | P2O5 | K2O Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. Plain Zone :1st yr. | 5kg | 150g | 100g | 145g |
| 2nd yr. | 10 kg | 300g | 200g | 290g Per plant |
| 3rd yr. | 15 kg | 450g | 300g | 435g per year |
| 4th yr.& above | 20 kg | 600g | 400g | 580g |
| B. Hill Zone :1st yr. | 10 kg | 100g | 100g | 100g |
| 2nd yr. | 10 kg | 100g | 100g | 100g Per plant |
| 3rd yr. | 10 kg | 100g | 100g | 100g per year |
| 4th yr.& above | 20 kg | 100g | 100g | 100g |

This mixture is to be applied in two split doses, i.e. during February/March and October/November.

Fertilizer should be applied leaving about 15-45cm space around the tree trunk and well beyond the canopy spread. It should be incorporated into the soil by light hoeing.

### Micronutrient:

Spray 0.2 %( 2 ml per litre of water) of Polymax or Multiplex during new flushes.

### Orchard Management:

Weeding should be done frequently at monthly intervals. Paddy straw or black polyethylene can also be used as mulch for controlling weeds.

To produce off-season crops, 15cm pruning after the harvest of main crop with a single spray of cycocel at 3000 ppm is recommended. Three irrigations at 15 days interval @ 15 lit/plant combined with black polythene (50 micron) mulching 1st week of November is effective in producing off-season crop (1st week of March).

### Harvesting:

After 2nd year of planting the plants start bearing. Bearing of Assam Lemon is continuous throughout the year. Harvesting should be done when fruits become fully matured. Peak period of bearing is July to September.

**Benefit: Cost ratio**: 3.50 after 4 years

7.80 for full bearing plants

# KHASI MANDARIN

_Citrus reticulata_ L. Blanco

**Cultivar :** Khasi Mandarin (Local)

**Soil :** Mandarin thrives well in deep lose well aerated soil devoid of any hard pan. Ideal pH range for mandarin is 5.5 to 7.5. It is also highly sensitive to moist soil conditions.

### Propagation:

*   1.  Seed
    2.  Budding

### Seed:

Since seeds of mandarin are mostly polyembryonic, the nucellar seedlings obtained through the mother plant, thus enable to retain the clonal characters as in vegetable propagation. Seeds should be sown first in (a) primary nursery and then seedlings should be transferred to the (b) secondary nursery.

### Primary nursery:

The site for the primary nursery should be selected on high land in light soil with good drainage. Raised seed beds of 20-30cm x 1m x 5m size should be prepared with a mixture of well decomposed cowdung, soil and sand at a ratio of 1:1:1 respectively. Seed from healthy and vigorous mother trees with uniform and good bearing capacity should be collected. The mother plant should preferably be 20-30 years old. Freshly extracted seeds should be washed and dried in shade. Seeds should be dibbled at 2.5cm. between the rows and 1.25cm within rows at a depth of 0.5 to 1.25cm. Adequate watering should be done at regular interval.

### Secondary nursery:

Seedlings at 4 to 6 leaf stage should be transplanted from the primary nursery to the secondary nursery bed. The seedlings should be transplanted at 30cm between and within the rows. Side sprouts should be regularly removed. Regular control measures against pests and diseases are essential. Seedling of 3 years is ready for transplanting.

2) **Budding:**

T or inverted T () budding is the best budding method for Khasi Mandarin:

1.  Root Stock :
    1.  Rough Lemon.
    2.  Rangpur Lime.
    3.  Cleopatra Mandarin.
    4.  Trifoliate orange.
2.  Rootstock Seedlings:

The rootstock seedlings are ready for budding within 11/2 to 2 years.

1.  Scion or bud-wood:

Scion or bud-wood should be collected from known productivity, vigorous, healthy and insect and disease free trees with a regular bearing habit. The best time of budding is September and February.

1.  Budding method:

Budding should preferably be done at a height of about 20-25 cm from the ground level. First a vertical cut (about 2 cm long) is made using a sharp budding knife in the stock plant. Then a horizontal cross cut at the top or bottom of the vertical cut is made as per ‘T’ or ‘-’ method through the bark about 1/3rd the length around the stock. Then the flap of bark is opened by the knife for insertion of the bud. After making the proper cut in the stock plant, the shield piece is cut out of the bud stick. A shield shaped piece of bark containing the bud from 1 to 2 cm in length is removed from the bud stick including a thin silver of wood on the cut side.

Then the shield is pushed under the two raised flaps of bark of stock until it is well covered by the two flaps of bark keeping the bud exposed. The bud union is wrapped using transparent polyethylene sheet. This can be unwrapped after 6-8 weeks of budding,. After success of the budding, just before new growth begins the root stock is cut off immediately above the bud. The budded plants are ready for transplanting within 6-9 months.

### Planting:

Before monsoon, pits of 0.75m x 0.75m x 0.75m size with a spacing of 5m x 5m are prepared and then refilled with soil-manure mixture (1: 1) and then allowed to settle.

The time of planting is May to August.

The plant is set at the centre of the pit and the soil around is compacted. Mulching with dry leaves should be done. Plants should be irrigated regularly at fortnightly intervals during dry periods.

### Pruning and Training:

In the nursery stage pruning and training should be done soon after the seedlings starts sprouting from the seed or scion buds have started growing.

After planting at the main field, all side branches should be removed upto 50- 60cm from the ground level keeping only single main tree trunk. Above 50-60cm height, pruning is confined to she training to develop mechanically strong trees with well spaced scaffold limbs before the onset of fruiting. The side branches at the main trunk should be allowed to grow in a spiral manner from base of the plant to top. At the bearing stage after harvest of the crop, the branches touching the ground should be cut close to the laterals without leaving any stub. All diseased, injured, cris-cross branches and water sprouts should be removed.

### Manure and Fertilizer:

| Age | FYM | N | P2O5 | K2O Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2nd yr. | 5kg | 150g | 120g | 100g |
| 3rd yr. | 10kg | 300g | 240g | 200g Per plant |
| 4th yr. | 15kg | 450g | 360g | 300g per year |
| 5th yr. | 20kg | 600g | 480g | 400g |
| 6th yr. onward | 25kg | 600g | 300g | 600g |

In the first year of planting no fertilizer is applied to the plant. For bearing plant, apply Neem cake @ 7.5 kg per plant per year.

Manures and fertilizers should be applied in two split doses, i.e. February/ March and September/October.

Fertilizer should be applied leaving about 15-45 cm space around the tree trunk and well beyond the canopy spread. Immediately after application of fertilizer, it should be incorporated into the soil by light or shallow hoeing.

### Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):

75% recommended dose of fertilizers i.e. 450 g N, 225 g P2O5, 450 g K2O and 5.625 kg Neem oil cake along with VAM 500g, PSB 100g, Azospirillium 100g and _Trichoderma harzianum_ 100 g are to be applied per plant per year in 2 splits

i.e. in March/April and September/October. The required amount of biofertilizers is to be mixed together with 10 kg FYM and should be applies 15 days before the application of inorganic NPK.

### Micronutrient:

Foliar application of micro nutrient viz. Zn, B and Mo is very much effective, @ 0.02%, 0.05% and 0.05% as ZnSO4, Borax and Ammonium-molybdate respectively thrice in a year during Feb-March, June-July and Sept-Oct.

### Orchard Management:

Weeding should be done from the month of April; first by hoeing followed by spray of Glyphosate a.i. @ 1 kg/ha after 60 days followed by another hand weeding after 60 days of chemical spraying.

### Intercropping:

Summer green gram/cowpea followed by toria as intercrop up to bearing stage and alternatively pineapple can be grown successfully as intercrop.

### Harvesting:

After 8-10 years, the seedling trees start bearing. Harvesting should be done by using ladder. Fruits should be collected in a bag and gently placed on a gunny carpet. Subsequently, they should be packed in baskets or cartoons for transportation to the market. About 800 to 2000 fruits per plant per year can be obtained from a 30-40 years old orchard.

### Plant Protection for Citrus:

1.  **Trunk borer**: It is a very damaging insect pest of mandarin orange in Assam. The grub bores hole into the tree trunk near the base and makes tunnel through the pith upward and the plant eventually dies. Prophylactic smearing of carbaryl or monocrotophos or quinalphos with lime and water (1:1:25) should be applied upto one metre from the base of the tree during March/April which prevents the adult from laying egg. Once the hole is made, it should be spiked with wire to kill the grub and then the hole should be cleaned and plastered with wet soil. Alternatively to kill the insect the hole should be plugged with cotton/cloths soaked in insecticides like dichlorvos (0.07%) or phosphamidon (0.05%) and then plastered with mud to have an airtight condition. Proper pruning and training are also essential to minimize the infestation.

Prophylactic smearing with lime solution (1kg/10lt. of water) along with 50ml monocrotophos and gum applied upto 1m from the base of the trees during March followed by injection of either 10ml petrol or dichlorvos 0.05% or monocrotophos 0.07% into the holes and sealing with mud and cowdung plastering for effective control of Trunk borer.

1.  **Shoot borer**: The shoot borer damages mostly young and new shoot of the plant. The grubs bore into the tip of the new shoot and make tunnels through the pith of the branch from top to bottom and the shoot dies due to infestation. The insect starts damaging from March to October. The insect can be controlled by pruning and burning the infested branches. Then smear Bordeaux paste with Nuvan in the cut portion. The insect can also be controlled by giving regular spraying with Monocrotophos (0.04%) i.e. 0.4ml in 1 litre of water) or phosphamidon (0.03% i.e. 0.3ml in 1 litre of water) starting from March to October at an interval of 20 days.
2.  **Bark eating caterpillar**: The insect damages the bark of the plant and as a result the flow of nutrients is stopped and ultimately the plant dies. It is a serious pest in neglected and old orchards. Removal of webbing followed by painting or spraying with monocrotophos 0.04% (0.4ml in 1 litre of water) on the infested portion of the bark can control the insect.
3.  **Leaf miner**: The larvae usually mine the undersides of new leaves making serpentine mines which are silver coloured because of entrapped air. Due to mining the leaves become distorted, curled and defoliation occurs during severe attack and the plant becomes stunted in growth. Two sprays with monocrotophos (0.4% i.e. 4ml in 1 litre of water) or phosphamidon (0.03% i.e. 0.3ml in 1 litre of water) during flushes have been found effective in controlling the insect. First spray should be given during initiation of new flush and the second after 20 days of the first spray.
4.  **Lemon butterfly**: The caterpillars feed on the leaves and defoliate the branches. Hand picking of larvae, with spraying with Sevin (0.1% i.e. 1ml in 1 litre of water) may be helpful in controlling the insect.
5.  **Fruit sucking moth**: The insect sucks the juice of the fruit and the fruits drop within few days. Destruction and disposal of fallen fruits and baiting with malathion 50 EC (0.1% i.e. 1 ml in 1 litre of water) with molasses (1%) and fruit juice help in controlling this insect.
6.  **Scales, mealy bugs, aphids and psylla**: These are sap sucking insects; Scales are brown tiny insects and are immobile. While sucking plant sap mealy bugs secrets honey dews on which sooty mould develops. Mealy bugs also cause fruit drop. The aphids infest the lower surface of the tender leaves, shoots and young fruits due to which the infested twigs are curled and the plant becomes sickly. The nymphs of psylla suck the cell sap from tender shoot, leaves and flowers causing curling, defoliation and drying of twigs.

To control these insects spray monocrotophos (0.025% i.e. 0.25ml in 1 litre of water) or phosphamidon (0.035% i.e. 0.35ml in 1 litre of water) or malathion (0.1% i.e. 1ml in 1 litre of water). Repeat the treatment and when necessary.

1.  **Gummosis or phytophtora foot rot**: Phytophtora disease produces symptoms of declining health of citrus trees causing rotting of roots, girdling of the tree trunk and defoliation. The first symptoms are dark staining of the bark followed by olive brown in colour with a water soaked appearance. In advanced stage, the bark cracks, strips off lengthwise as in dries and gum starts exuding particularly in the late spring resulting into yellowing and die back. At the early stage, the affected portion should be scraped with a little extra healthy tissue without injuring the wood and then smear Bordeaux paste or Bordeaux paint (1:2 linseed oil).
2.  **Wither tip**: Wither tip or dry-up twigs from top to the bottom is a serious problem in citrus. Pruning followed by spraying of 1% Bordeaux mixture after harvest of the fruit control this disease. Twig blight or wither tip or dry-up twigs can be effectively managed by pruning in the month of January/February followed by two sprays with Copper oxychloride (COC) @ 3g/litre at 30 days interval or Pruning followed by one spray with COC @ 3g/litre + one spray after 30 days with carbendazim @ 1g/litre.
3.  **Scab:** The scab lesions appear as minute water soaked round spots which enlarge slightly, turn brownish and then corky on fruit, leave and young twigs. Removal of infected leaves, twigs, fruit and spraying of Bordeaux mixture (1%) or copper oxychloride 50WP (0.3% i.e. 3g in 1 litre of water) or Mancozeb 75 WP (2 g/l) have been found effective in controlling the disease.
4.  **Canker**: It is a bacterial disease. The canker lesions appear as minute water soaked round spots, enlarge slightly, turn brownish, corky which can be controlled by 1% Bordeaux mixture or Streptocyclin 100 ppm + copper oxychloride 0.3% (3 g in 1 litre of water) spraying during new flushes.
5.  **Greening**: The infected plant shows chlorosis of leaves, thickening of leaf blade, shortening of twigs internodes, off-season blooming, leaf shedding and die-back. To control this disease, insect vector psylla should be first controlled (see psylla control).
6.  **Twig Blight**: Pruning in the month of January/February followed by 2 sprays of carbendazim 0.1% and thereafter 2 sprays of Copper oxychloride 0.3% (3 g in 1 litre of water) at monthly interval can control.
7.  **Pre harvest stem end rot**: Four sprays of carbendazim 0.1%( 1 g in 1 litre of water) at monthly interval from May i.e. after fruit set to control fruit drop due to pre-harvest stem end rot.

### Other Maladies:

1.  **Zinc deficiency**: Zinc deficiency is considered as the most wide spread and damaging micronutrient deficiency of citrus. Deficiency symptom develops only in the new growth. The leaves are small sized, chlorotic crowded on shoot stems giving a bunched appearance, mottling, twig die-back and ultimately the tree starts declining. It can be controlled effectively by foliar spray of 0.4 to 0.6% (4 to 6 g in 1 litre of water) Zinc sulphate during new flushes.
2.  **Moss**: Remove the mosses mechanically by rubbing with gunny bag.
3.  **Loranthus**: The group of parasitic plants should not be allowed to develop on branches. It should be controlled by efficient pruning.
4.  **Fruit drop**. Spray 10 ppm Planofix (1 ml in 4.5 lit water) or 2,4-D @ 25 g/100 lit of water immediately after flowering and again after one month. 3 sprays of

0.1% Carbendazim along with 30 ppm NAA starting from May onwards i.e. after fruit setting at bimonthly interval also can control fruit drop.

Suggestions for Improvement of Citrus-Decline

1.  Proper drainage should be provided to drain out the excess water from the root-zone.
2.  For vegetative propagation the mother plants should be ascertained of their freeness from virus and mycoplasma diseases.
3.  It is advisable to establish new orchard with budded plants on resistant root stocks.
4.  Regular manuring of both non-bearing and bearing trees is essential.
5.  Foliar feeding of micronutrients is essential as a regular practice.
6.  Cultural practices like regular weeding, intercropping with only short duration, shallow rooted legume crops upto pre-bearing stage are suggested.
7.  Pruning of dead and dried twigs, removal of plant parasites like loranthus etc. are desirable practices.
8.  Soil working near root zone should confine only upto 10 cm soil depth.
9.  Application of Bordeaux paste may be practised regularly to a height of about 50 cm of the trunk from the ground level.
10.  Pest and disease control measures should be followed strictly.

For both bearing and non-bearing plantation, combination of banana and pineapple with an additional crop like black pepper or betelvine can be grown as intercrops.

### Disorder:

**_Phula Tamul_**: In Arecanut cultivation, the phenomenon of the soft/leathery kernel, i.e. lack of proper hardening of kernel associated with moisture stress in the endosperm in ripe and mature fruit may be termed as phula tamul. This condition of fruit is generally found in the first bunch of the palm which ripens earlier and gets ready to be harvested in the beginning of the harvesting season (Late March to Early April). The incidence is observed when the palm experiences scanty or irregular rainfall during the fruit development period.

**Control**: Providing irrigation to the arecanut plants especially during the dry months with proper drainage facilities followed by improved cultural practices are some of the remedial measures to be adopted.

**Nut Splitting** : It is considered to be a physiological disorder. Improvement of drainage in area of high water table is known to help in minimizing the incidence. Spraying of Borax at the rate of 2g/l per palm during the early stage of the problem also reduces the splitting.

**Pencil tip**: Apply adequate manures and fertilizers regularly and improve cultural practices. Improvement of drainage is essential in areas of high water table. Plants should not suffer from N deficiency.

### Plant Protection:

Bud rot – Same as in coconut Ganoderma – Same as in coconut

### Band disease:

*   *   1.  Improve the soil condition by loosening hard soil strata present and providing good drainage.

# BETELVINE

_Piper betle_ Linn.

### Introduction:

In Assam three different types of cultivation of betelvines are followed -

(1) Around arecanut or any other trees. (2) Baroj type and (3) Khuti type. Of these, the first type is generally followed in most households whereas the later two types are practised for commercial purposes.

### Cultivar:

Assamiya pan or Jati pan, Khasi pan, Garo pan, Sanchi pan, Bangla pan, (Kali Bangla, Nua Bangla, Ghanegette and Godi Bangla) Mitha pan and Karbi pan.

### Soil:

Well drained fertile clay to sandy loam type of soils are suitable. For a new plantation top soil transplanted from a nearby plot should be used. Soil pH may be increased upto 6.5 by adding lime at least 20 days before planting the cutting of betelvine.

### Cultivation with Arecanut Support:

Pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 30 cm size are dug 60-90 cm away from the base of arecanuts and filled up with well decomposed FYM and top soil. Three to four cuttings are generally planted in each pit for each of the arecanut tree. It is extremely important to press the soil firmly around the cuttings. Generally 60 to 90 cm long cuttings having 6 buds are preferable.

### Baroj Type and Khuti Type of Cultivation:

Baroj are prepared out of bamboo and thatch. These are covered from all the sides with thatch and bamboo support and betelvines are supported to climb on bamboo sticks and in Khuti Type. The roof is covered with thatch.

### Planting Material:

The vines are propagated by terminal stem cutting obtained from mature mother vines. In Baroj system, the spacing between the cuttings is 15 cm from plant to plant and 50 cm from row to row. Approximately 95,000 to 1, 00,000 cuttings are required per hectare for planting. In Khuti Type, the row to row and plant to plant distance is 90 cm and approximately 10,000 to 12,000 cuttings are required per hectare.

### Planting Season and Raising of Seedlings:

Land for planting the betelvine setts should be fully pulverized and soil treatment should be given with Formalin solution (4%) which should be sprinkled at the rate of 3 liters per sq.m. of soil and covered with polythene sheet or moist

gunny bag for 24 hours. Planting should not be done for 15-20 days following formalin treatment.

Before planting, drench the soil with Mancozeb 75 WP 0.2% uniformly by means of a rose can. Lines are made for planting and cuttings obtained from disease free garden and treated with a solution consisting of Bordeaux mixture 0.5% and streptocycline 500 ppm for half an hour before planting. In Assam, the cuttings are planted during May to August.

### Manure and Fertilizers:

Age N : P2O5 : K2O (kg/ha)

1 - 5 year 0 : 50 :100

\>5 – 10 year 100 : 50 : 150

\>10 year 200 : 50 : 100

For Baroj type cultivation, apply N @ 200 kg/ha/year as mustard oil cake in 4 split doses.

Apply 6(six) foliar sprays of ZnSO4 (4%) at 60 days intervals to increase the leaf yield. The first spray should start in April.

### Trailing the Vines:

Trailing of the vines is done by tying the vines at intervals of 15 to 20cm along bamboo sticks loosely with the help of banana fibre, arecanut leaf sheath or any other locally available material.

### Lowering the Vines:

Under normal cultivation, the vines grow to a height of about 3m in a year. When they reach this height, it is needed to be lowered down. This is achieved by lowering the vines down to the ground level at least twice in a year. The top of the young vine is again winded around the stick for the next season’s growth.

### Plant Protection:

1.  **Phytophthora leaf and root rot**: Apply four drenches and eight sprays of Bordeaux mixture @ 1.0% and 0.5% respectively. From June to September Drenching and spraying should be done at monthly and fifteen days interval.
2.  **Bacterial leaf spot**: Give four sprays of Streptomycin (1.0%) along with Bordeaux mixture (0.5%) at 20 days interval after initiation of the disease.
3.  **Anthracnose**: Give four spray of Bordeaux mixture @ 0.5% at 20 days interval after initiation of the disease.
4.  **Biocontrol of _Phytophthora_ and basal rot of betelvine**: Apply 500kg de- oiled mustard oil cake at quarterly interval cultured with _Trichoderma harzianum_ at the root region of the vines.

# CASHEWNUT

_Anacardium occidentale_

### Climatic requirement

Cashew is restricted to an altitude below 700 M where temperature does not fall below 200C for prolonged period. The optimum temperature for growth is 170C to 360C. Cashew is grown in areas with annual rainfall ranging from 600 to 4500mm. Fruit set in cashew is good if rains are not excessive during flowering (November to February). Dry spell during flowering ensures better harvest.

### Soil

Cashew is gown on a wide variety of soils like laterite, red soils and coastal sands of Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharastra, Tamilnadu and West Bengal. Whatever the nature of top soil, free drainage and absence of brackish water are considered essential.

### Planting material

Cashew is a highly cross pollinated crop, hence seed propagation is avoided. The most common and successful method of propagation is the use of softwood graft.

### Soft wood grafting

1.  About 45-60 days old seedlings raised in polythene bags are utilized as root stocks.
2.  From the selected variety, lateral shoots of current seasons’ growth (pencil thickness, 3-5 months old) are selected and procured on the mother plant by clipping the leaf blades. After 10-15 days these shoots are collected and used as scions.
3.  The terminal growth of the rootstock (soft wood portion) at a height of 15cm from ground level is decapitated and a cleft of 5-6 cm deep is made on the stem.
4.  The scion stick is mended into a wedge shape of 5-6cm long by chopping of the bark and a little portion of wood from two opposite sides.
5.  The wedge of the scion is inserted carefully into the cleft of the root stock.
6.  Then the graft union is secured firmly with a polythene strip.
7.  A white polythene cover is inserted on the graft and it is tied at the bottom to maintain humidity.

### Planting season

Planting of softwood grafts is usually done during monsoon (June to August).

### Land Preparation

Clearing of wild growth, digging of pits for planting should be done during pre monsoon season (May to June).

### Variety

So far National Research Centre of Cashew (NRCC) has released about 40 varieties. Out of which NRCC has recommended Jhargram-1, Ullal-3 and BPP-8 for North Eastern Region.

**Jhargram-1**: It has a medium compact canopy and intensive branching habit. It bears on an average 6 nuts per bunch and yields 8.5 kg/tree with small sized nuts (5g). Shelling percentage is 30 and kernel grade is W 320.

**BPP-8:** This variety is superior to all other released varieties from Bapatla. It yields about 14 kg/tree with better nut size (8.2 g) with 29% shelling recovery. The kernel grade is W 210.

**Ullal-3:** It is an early flowering variety with short duration (November to January), fruiting period is also short (50 to 60 days). The fruit occurs from January to March. It is a high yielding variety with average production of 14.7 kg raw nut/ tree. The nut size is medium with 7g per nut. Shelling percentage is 30 and kernel grade is W 210. The apples bears red colour.

### Spacing

*   A spacing of 7.5 m x 7.5 m (175 plants/ha) for 8 m x 8 m (156 plants/ha) is recommended for cashew in sloppy areas.
*   In level plains it is advantageous to plant the graft at 10 m x 5 m spacing (hedge row system) which will accommodate about 200 plants/ha and at the same time leaving adequate interspaces for growing intercrops during the initial years.
*   Under high density planting system (HDP) a spacing of 4 m x 4 m is recommended (625 plants/ha) in low fertility soils whereas spacing of 6 m x 4 m (416 plants/ ha) and 5m x 5m (400 plants/ha) are recommended in medium fertile soils.

### Pit size

*   The pits should be opened at least 15 to 20 days before planting.
*   The pit size of 1m length x 1m breadth should be opened in soils with hard laterite substratum. A pit size 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm is sufficient in other soils.

### Filling up of pits

*   The pits should be filled with mixture of top soil, compost (5 kg/pit) or poultry manure (2 kg/pit) and rock phosphate 200 g/pit).
*   A small drainage channel at the elevation side of pit can be made to drain the excess rain water.

### Planting

While planting the grafts, the polythene bag has to be removed carefully without disturbing the ball of earth. A portion of soil is scooped out from the

centre of the filled pit and grafted plant is placed in such a way that the graft joint remain above the soil level. The base of the plant should be covered with topsoil and pressed gently and a stack should be placed near the graft plant to prevent wind damage. The polythene sheet used during grafting should be removed at planting time to avoid constricted growth at the grafting point.

### Soil and water conservation

Terracing is required in sloppy site where soil erosion and leaching of plant nutrients are generally common. In such case terracing with catch pits followed by mulching is done.

### Terracing

*   Terracing of 2m radius is prepared during May to June at the second year of planting.
*   The terraces are done by removing the soil from the elevated side and spread it in the lower side of the slope.
*   Terraces are generally made crescent shape to retain the washed soil from the upper side along with rain water.

### Catch pit

*   A catch pit of 200cm length x 30cm width x 45cm depth) across the slope at upper side of peripheral end of the terraces is made to conserve rainwater. A channel is made side way to drain out excess rainwater.

### Mulching

*   Mulching can be done at the basin of cashew plants either with green leaves or dry leaves soon after planting.
*   Live mulches are also utilized to conserve moisture.

### Manure and fertilizers

*   Application of 10 to 15 kg FYM or compost per plant every year is beneficial.
*   The recommended dose of fertilizer by National Research Centre for Cashew is 750g N, 125g P2O5 and 125g K2O per year per plant. It is advisable to use straight fertilizer instead of complex fertilizer.

### The Year wise fertilizer is as follows

| Year (s) |  | Dose (g/plant) |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| after planting | Urea | Rock phosphate | Muriate of potash |
| 1st | 330 | 125 | 40 |  |
| 2nd | 660 | 250 | 80 |  |
| 3rd | 990 | 375 | 120 |  |
| 4th | 1320 | 500 | 160 |  |
| 5th | 1650 | 625 | 200 |  |

*   The fertilizer is to be applied in two splits. First split is given during pre monsoon (May/June) and second part is applied in post monsoon (August/ September).
*   Fertilizers are applied in 50cm circular band in flat land at a distance of 50cm, 70cm, 100cm and 150cm away from the trunk of cashew of plant during 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th year after planting and onwards respectively and rake the fertilizer into the soil.
*   In sloppy areas the fertilizers are applied in circular trenches of 25cm width and 15cm depth at the distance mentioned earlier.

### Canopy management

Training and pruning are essential management practices in cashew.

### Training

*   Training is done in the initial years.
*   During 1st and 2nd years after planting flower panicles are removed to encourage vegetative growth and frame formation.
*   Stacking is provided to plants to prevent lodging.
*   The lower branches are gradually removed with the help of secateur during the initial 4 to 5 years of planting so that the trunk up to 60 to 75 cm remain single stemmed. This operation assists easy cultural operations like pest control and nut collection.
*   Branches are evenly spaced by pruning unwanted criss-cross branches.
*   The mature plants are detopped at 3 to 4m height and a semi globular canopy is maintained.

### Pruning

*   Water sprout, crown suckers, dead branches/twigs are removed.
*   About 60 per cent of leader shoots (1 to 2 years old laterals) are to be pruned by pruning back at two third lengths.
*   Pruning at least in 2 to 3 years is necessary depending on amount of dead wood and age of the plants.

### Intercropping/Mixed cropping

*   Intercropping or mixed cropping is recommended in cashew orchard during the initial years of formative stage of cashew.
*   Intercrops help to check soil erosion apart from utilizing soil water and solar energy.

### Some of the recommended intercrops are:

**Pineapple**: Pineapple can be grown for 7 years from planting in between cashew plants in trenches of 1m width and 0.5m depth.

**Black pepper**: Black peppers can be grown by allowing them to trail in the stems and branches of more than 6 years old plants. A net profit of Rs. 14,000/ ha can be achieved from black pepper.

**Ginger**: Ginger can be raised in the initial 3 to 4 years of cashew plantations. A net profit of Rs. 40,000/ha can be obtained from ginger as a mixed crop.

**Turmeric**: Turmeric can also be easily taken up as intercrop in the initial 7 years.

**Vegetables**: A wide range of vegetable viz., cucurbits, cowpea annual leafy vegetables etc. can be raised.

### Plant Protection

Cashew is most commonly attacked by Tea mosquito bug. (_Helopeltis antonii)_, cashew stem and root borer.

**Tea mosquito bug** (_Helopeltis antonii)_: This insect causes maximum damage to the new flushes, flowers and young fruits by sucking cell sap. If extreme infestation occurs, the leaves show scorching effect which drastically reduces the yield of the crop. The occurrence and build up of the insect coincide with the new flushes, flowering and fruit setting after cessation of monsoon.

The insect is controlled by spraying insecticide viz., monocrotophos and carbaryl at different times. The first spray of monocrotophos @ 0.05% (1.5ml/l) is to be given at the time of new vegetative flush, which is followed by carbaryl @ 0.1% (2g/l) at flowering stage. This is followed by another third spray of carbaryl at the same rate at the time of fruit setting.

**Cashew stem and root borer:** The grub of this insect causes extensive damage to the old plantations. Young plantations are also not spared. The grub makes irregular tunnels inside the trunk and feed on the bark. Infested plants show falling off of fruss near the base of trunk as these are expelled out by the grub. Unattended old plants are mostly attacked. The mature roots are attacked by the grub of the insect. It is a high flier. Grubs are medium to large in size (5cm x 15cm length). Extensive feeding results in death of the plants within a period of 1 to 3 years.

To save the plants from the grub attack, the infested part is carefully chiseled out to find the grub inside the trunk hidden in tunnels and then physical removal is mostly done with prophylactic swabbing of carbaryl 1.0% solution. Examination of exposed roots and collar region is most essential to detect insect infestation.

### Harvesting

Harvesting of cashew nut for its kernel starts by March to June. Nut maturity is a varietal character from a short duration to long duration. The nuts are allowed to be matured fully along with the apples. The apple matures slower than the nuts. Mature nuts show brown colour. Ripen apples are yellow, red and yellow reddish in colour. The apples are used or various industrial use as well as

in preparation of pickles and jams. If only nuts are to be used than it is better to allow the nuts to fall naturally. The mature well filled nuts sink in water easily which is used as a selection criterion of mature nuts. As soon as nuts are collected they should be washed and sun dried as a pre-conditioning measure.

### Processing of cashew nuts

Processing of raw cashew nuts consists of conditioning of nuts, shelling, drying, humidifying, peeling, grading and packing of kernels.

### Conditioning:

Harvested mature cashew nuts are sun dried for two days soon after harvesting to bring the moisture content from 16% or above to 8 to 9%. Then the nuts are packed in gunny bags and stored for further processing.

*   Conditioning is required to make the nuts hard and brittle so that the shell can be removed without damaging kernel inside.
*   Conditioning is done in three ways. They are drum roasting, oil bath roasting and steam roasting. Among these, the steam roasting is most commonly followed which have the added advantage of utilizing the cashew shell nut liquid (CSNL) for further industrial use.

### Steam roasting

The sun dried cashew nuts are roasted in steam under pressure of 25 to 30 lb/inch for 20 to 30 minutes. Then the nuts are allowed to cool 24 hours before shelling.

### Shelling

*   Shelling requires hand and foot operated mechanical devices in which the roasted nut is held by fingers between two pairs of blades of the shelling machine, in such a way that the kernel never come into contact with blades.
*   Then the splitted nuts become easy to scoop out the kernel, 92 to 95% kernel recovery is possible with the hand and foot operated sheller.

### Drying of kernel

*   Scooped out kernels are then sent to drier in trays to be dried in hot chamber at 780 to 800 C for 6 to 8 hours to bring the moisture content in the nuts to 4 to 5%.
*   For uniform drying, the trays used for spreading the kernels are changed in position in the chambers.
*   Dried kernels in the same trays from the hot chamber are brought to a humidifier room to facilitate easy peeling of seed coat.

### Peeling

*   Peeling of seed coat (testa) is done with the help of sharp knives or bamboo edges.
*   70% kernels are recovered through peeling operation.

### Grading

*   Grading of peeled kernels is done manually.
*   Kernels are graded according to size of wholesome or bits. There are many commercial grades viz., W180, W210, W240, W320, W450 and W500.
*   The large size kernels are graded as W180 (309 to 410/kg) and smallest grades are W500 (1000 to 1100/kg).
*   The common grades are WW (White whole), SW (Scorched whole), DW (Dessert whole), SWS (Scorched whole seconds) etc.
*   Pieces are also graded as B (Bits), S (Splits), LWP (Large white pieces), BB (Baby bits), SB (Scorched bits), SS (Scorched splits), SSP (Scorched small seconds), SPS (Scorched pieces seconds), DP (Dessert pieces).

### Packing:

The export trade required packing of kernels in 11.3 kg tin containers which are

hermetically sealed by infusing CO2. Moulded vacuum packing (MVP) is graining popularity where in nitrogen flushing is done to avoid oxidative rancidity.

**VEGETABLE CROPS**

# HI-TECH NURSERIES

Nursery is a place where seedling, sapling or any other planting materials are raised and sold out for planting in gardens and orchards. The nursery industry is diverse, comprising such varied operations as the production of potted plants, cut flowers, greens, ornamentals, fruit and tree nursery plants. The initial planting material is the basic requirement on which both the quality and quantity of the final crop depends.

### Objectives of nursery production

*   To raise healthy and disease free planting materials.
*   To distribute plant materials in masses who have little knowledge about the techniques of raising plants.
*   To introduce exotic species/cultivars.
*   Planting of nursery grown plants is the surest method of artificially regenerating poor and barren sites.
*   Replacement of casualties.

### Selection of site for the nursery

The selection of site for the nursery should be made after considerable care and thought since location has great impact on overall success of the nursery. The land for nursery should be levelled for most efficient use. Areas that are prone to flooding should be avoided. The soil should have good structure and porosity. Sites with degraded top soil should be avoided.

### Propagation structures

Different types of propagation structures like greenhouse, hot bed, cold frame, lath house, net house and mist chambers etc. are being routinely used under different agro-climatic conditions for different crops.

### Propagation techniques

It includes all the steps involved in the propagation/multiplication of a particular crop/cultivar, from beginning to the end, i.e. it provides a schedule of activities for propagation. Plant multiplication involves either sexual or asexual propagation.

### Containerization

Plastic bag of appropriate size, root trainers, earthen pots or trays can be utilized at various stages of plant multiplication. These containers can be shifted to green house for protecting against rain, cold or high temperature for quick growth.

### Rooting media/potting mixture

Field soil can be used in container mixes (10% -30% by volume) but requires the additional step of pasteurization to eliminate disease and weed seeds. Though peat moss can be used as an alternatives but it is a non renewable resource.

### Importance of mother plants

Stock or mother plants should receive every care in the way of pruning, manuring and weed control to keep them in good condition over a period of years. The aim should be to keep them as far as possible, in strongly vegetative condition. Both, the rootstock and the scion determine the performance of a compound horticultural tree. Choice of a scion is based on its quality, yield performance, adaptability and other horticulturally desirable traits. Rootstocks exhibit a great effect on the production efficiency, yield, quality, adaptability, tree vigour and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses of scion cultivar. The primary function of rootstock is to provide anchorage by growing deep in to the soil and also regulate the uptake of moisture and nutrients.

### Care of nursery plants

Proper care of nursery plants includes timely application of manures and fertilizers, irrigation and weed control. Regardless of fertilizer type whether the source is synthetic or organic in sustainable nursery production, the emphasis is on zero runoff. Organic or synthetic slow release fertilizers help to cut down levels of nitrates in run off water. Foliar feeding can be used to supplement soil and liquid fertilization. The two most widely used irrigation systems are overhead and drip and each has certain advantages and disadvantages. Weed control is extremely important in container production, since large quantities of media are lost when big weeds are pulled out of containers.

### Some marketing tips

Effective marketing is key to profitability and success of a nursery.

1.  Ensure reliable and consistent plant availability.
2.  Proper labelling & proper displaying.
3.  Place plant in clean containers/proper location.
4.  Nurseries must be registered.
5.  Proper quarantine measures.
6.  Adding value to the product.
7.  Market research.

# PROCEDURE FOR ‘NURSERY RAISING’ OF TRANSPLANTED VEGETABLE CROPS

### VEGETABLE CROPS:

1.  Select a sunny area with well drained friable light soil rich in organic matter.
2.  Bring the soil into fine tilth and prepare the bed of 1 m width and of convenient length. Raise it to 10-15 cm above ground level.
3.  For an area of 10 m2 in the bed, mix 20 kg sand or silt and 20 kg compost (well decomposed, dried and sieved) thoroughly.
4.  To make the soil free from soil-borne disease causing pathogens (most common disease in the nursery is the ‘Damping-off’) drench the bed with 0.1% solution of Captan or Fytolan or Formalin 4% solution so as to saturate the soil upto a depth of 10-15 cm.
5.  Keep in covered, immediately after treating, with polythene sheet or gunny bag or thick paper for 2 days.
6.  Uncover the soil and get it loosened and leave it as such for 3 to 4 days.
7.  Treat the dry seeds with Captaf or Thiram @ 3g/kg seeds against seed-borne pathogens.
8.  Thoroughly mix malathion 5% dust @ 20g/10m2 in order to protect the seedlings from soil-borne insects.
9.  Sow the seeds thinly in U-shaped furrows spaced at 2.5 cm and at a depth of 1-2 cm (4 times the diameter of the seed). Cover the seeds immediately with a thin layer of sand mixed with well dried and sieved cow dung. The surface should be levelled and firmed by wooden leveller.
10.  Water the sown beds using water can fitted with a fine rose.
11.  Cover the beds with a thin layer of straw, banana leaf or dried grass to prevent displacement of seeds. The cover should be removed the first appearance of sprouts.
12.  The seedlings get ready for transplanting when they attain 10-15 cm height or become 30-35 days old.
13.  Harden the seedlings before lifting by gradual reduction of water for about 7 days.
14.  Soak the beds 6 hours before lifting to facilitate the maximum retention or roots and plant turgidity.
15.  Avoid shading or protection of seedlings; allow maximum sunlight except in case of expected injury due to heavy rain or frost.
16.  Dip the seedlings in plant protection formulations just before transplanting to avoid attack in the initial stage of establishment.

### Secondary Nursery:

In case of large scale cultivation, hardening of seedlings of Cabbage, Cauliflower, Knolkhol, Tomato, Brinjal, Chilli etc. can be done by pricking them to a wider spacing

of 5-10 cm either way in a well prepared secondary nursery when their first pair of true leaves develop. Shade should be provided for at least 2 days.

### CULTIVATION OF HYBRID VARIETIES OF VEGETABLES:

Hybrid varieties of vegetables are comparatively superior in respect of yield and quality as compared to the traditional varieties. Presently, a number of Govt. organizations and private seed companies have developed some hybrid varieties with high yielding attributes. Moreover, a large amount of hybrid seeds are imported each year by the private companies and sold in the domestic markets. These are widely accepted by the farmers of our country. Every year new hybrid varieties are incorporated into the cultivation stream making the former ones obsolete, and hence, it is not possible to standardize agro-techniques for each and every variety at the University level. It is, therefore, advisable to adopt as such the package of practices of these hybrid varieties recommended by the concerned companies for Assam. However, some hybrid varieties of tomato, cabbage, cauliflower, capsicum and cucumber released by IAHS and HOECHST were tested at AAU and had been found promising for Assam condition.

**The comprehensive package of practices for various hybrid varieties of vegetables, as per IAHS Company leaflet, is given below:**

# LAYOUT OF KITCHEN GARDEN

### Objectives of Kitchen Gardening:

1.  To meet the daily requirement of balance diet (85g fruits, 75-125g green leafy vegetables, 75g root or tubers and 100g of other vegetables).
2.  To produce fresh and quality vegetables.
3.  To utilize the labour of the family members profitably.
4.  To obtain pleasure, inspiration and a means of recreation.

### Principles of Kitchen Gardening:

1.  Select well drained sunny area at the backyard near water source.
2.  Size and design of the garden depend on availability of land. However, the garden should preferably be rectangular in shape.
3.  Selection of crops is governed by choice of the family, size of the garden and time available to devote in the garden.
4.  200 sq.m area in sufficient for a five member family to supply 1.5 kg of vegetable per day.
5.  Quick growing plants like banana, papaya, lemons etc. should be planted in the northern side of the garden and climbing type of vegetables like cucurbits, dolichos, etc. can be grown near the fence or boundary wall.
6.  To ensure steady and regular supply of vegetables, several sowing of a particular crop at short intervals should be done during the season.
7.  Ridges which separate the beds may be utilized for growing root crops like radish, carrot, etc.
8.  Early maturing crops should be planted together in continuous beds so that the area can be made available at one for putting late crops.
9.  Interspaces of the long duration crops like brinjal, tomato, chillies, etc. may be utilized for quick growing crops like spinach, beet, lettuce, knolkhol, etc.
10.  One or two compost pits should be dug in the corner of garden to dispose off the plant residues which will be reutilized as compost material.

# A FEW GUIDELINES FOR GROWING CUCURBITS

1.  Cucurbits should be preferably sown in raised beds.
2.  All cucurbits can be planted in pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm x 45 cm filled with soil, FYM and basal dose of fertilizer @ 40-50 g Urea, 40-50 g SSP, 80-100 g MOP.
3.  These crops should be provided with suitable climbing support.
4.  In monoecious cucurbits such as cucumber, ridge gourd, sponge gourd, pumpkin, bottle gourd etc. where percentage of male flower is higher than the female flower; the femaleness, fruit-set, fruit size and total yield can be increased by spraying NAA (100 ppm) and Ethrel (25 ppm) at 2 to 4 leaf stage.
5.  In dioecious cucurbits, like pointed gourd and spine gourd where male and female flowers are borne in separate plants, fertilization is a problem. In such cucurbits, a male-female ratio of 1:10 should be maintained in the field for proper fruit setting.

| Kufri Sindhuri | 110-120 | 85-100 | 100-160 | Tall erect | Round Shaped skin light redeyes flesh pale yellow sticky | ModeratelyTolerant |

**Soil type**:

Well drained sandy loam and loan soils, rich in organic matters are suitable. Preferably a pulse crop should be included in the rotation to improve the soil condition.

### Field preparation:

Field should be thoroughly ploughed to obtain a good tilth. It should be levelled for uniform distribution of irrigation water or to maintain soil moisture uniformly under rained situation. The furrows should be prepared at 50 cm apart.

### Time of planting:

The optimum time for planting is mid October to mid November. In case of Kufri Sindhuri planting may be extended up to first week of December.

### Methods of planting:

The sprouted tubers should be planted in furrows with sprouts facing up ward. In handling the tubers, care should be taken to avoid sprout damage.

### Seed selection:

Virus free, healthy, medium or small sized sprouted tubers are to be selected for planting. Ideal size is about 2.5 cm in diameter (25-40 g) Bigger sized tubers may be cut into pieces longitudinally with 2-3 eyes in each piece.

### Seed sources:

Certified seeds of the recommended varieties are to be procured from Govt. or such other recognized agencies.

### Seed treatment:

In case of cut seeds, the pieces are to be dipped in Mancozeb (Indofil M- 45) @ 5g in 1 lit of water for about 10 minutes. Benomyl (Benlate) 0.1% solution may be used if other chemicals are not readily available. After treatment seeds are to be spread thinly and dried under shade for 48 hours, or should be covered with moist gunny bags for 2-3 days for suberization.

### Seed rate:

The seed requirement is 22.5-23 q/ha when size of the tubers are about

2.5 cm in diameter (about 25 g) and planted with an intra row spacing of 15 cm. Intra row spacing is increased with bigger size tuber.

### Fertility management:

The tones or 5 truck loads or 20 cart loads of well decomposed FYM/ha should be applied in the furrows before planting.

| Nutrient | Requirement (kg/ha) | Form of fertilizer | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (kg/ha) | (kg/bigha) |
| A. Rained : |  |  |  |  |
| N | 60 | Urea | 133 | 19 |
| P2O5 | 50 | SSP | 312 | 45 |
| K2O | 50 | MOP | 83 | 12 |
| B. Irrigated : |  |  |  |  |
| N | 60 | Urea | 133 | 19 |
| P2O5 | 100 | SSP | 624 | 90 |
| K2O | 100 | MOP | 168 | 24 |

Entire quantity of mixed fertilizers should be applied in furrows as basal application and be covered with a thin layer of soils so that tubers do not came into direct contact with the fertilizers.

### Mulching:

Adoption of mulching under rain-fed situations increases tuber rain-fed situations increases tuber yield. Water hyacinth plant materials are applied to cover the entire field after planting of tubers under flat method. Of course, skin of the tubers may turn green due to exposure to sunlight or shrinkage of mulching materials on drying. Tubers become unsuitable for consumption on greening, however, quantities may be reduced by applying mulching materials in furrows just after planting of tubers, materials in furrows just after planting of tubers, immediately followed by light soil cover. Such practice also reduces rodent damage of tubers considerably.

### Irrigation:

The furrow method of irrigation has to be adopted. Three irrigation has to be adopted. Three irrigations should be applied, first at 25 days (stolen formation

stage), second at 60 days (tuber formation stage) and third at 80 days (tuber formation stage) after emergence or sprouts. In case of application of mulching materials in furrows, only two irrigations are to be applied at 25 and 60 days after emergence of sprouts. At the time of application of irrigation care should be taken not to submerge the ridges completely.

### Weeding and Interculture:

Earthing up is to done just before first and second irrigation. Under rained condition, this should be done at stem and tuber formation stage. One or two intercultural operations may be necessary when weed infestation is high.

### Plant Protection:

1.  **Pests:**

In areas where infestation of red ants and other soil insects are common, application of phorate 10% granules @ 15 kg/ha or malathion 5% dust @ 40 kg/ ha in the soil at the time of earthing up should be done to control insects efficiently. Local potato variety Lalpahari: is relatively tolerant to red and cutworm.

Application of mustard oil cake @ 150 kg/ha at the time of erarthing up reduces red and white ant infestation to a greater degree.

Soil application of quinalphos 25EC @ 400 g a.i./ha (1.5 lit./ha or 2 ml/lit of water) against white grub and other soil insects in potato.

### Disease:

**Late blight**

One spraying of Mancozeb 75% ( Indofil M 45 / Dithane M 45) @ 0.25% (2.5 g/ Lit) at canopy closure (35-40 days after planting) and second spraying of Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% (Curzet M / Moximate) @ 0.25% (2.5 g/Lit) at first appearance of the disease (if disease appear) and third spraying of Mancozeb 75% (Indofil M 45 / Dithane M 45) @ 0.25% (2.5 g/Lit) after 10 days of second spraying and fourth spraying of Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% (Curzet M / Moximate) @ 0.25% (2.5 g/Lit) after 10 days of third spraying against late blight of potato.

Against late blight, six sprayings with Mancozeb 75%. (Dithane M-45) @ 0.25 % ( 2.5g/1) at an interval of 12 days.

OR

Ridomil MZ-27 (64% mancozeb +8% metalaxyl (2 g/1) followed by Dithane M-45 (2.5g/l) in alternate application (3 sprayers with Ridomil MZ-27 and 3 with Dithane M-45) at an interval of 12 days give very good control if used at the following

rates with high volume sprayers.

Early stage: (1st month) 600 l of water/ha. Mid stage: (2nd month) 800 l of water/ha. Late stage: (3rd month) 100 l of water/ha.

The first spray should be give during 10-15th December. Use of sticker Triton (0.5ml/1) will be essential in the spray solution for spraying during rainy weather.

Depending upon weather conditions particularly on cloudy weather Dithane M-45 should be sprayed as prophylactic measure. Alternatively, Zineb (Dithane Z-78) @ 0.25% (25 g in 10 l of water) can be used. If disease appears spraying should be done at an interval of 7 to 10 days depending upon weather conditions. While spraying, care should be taken to cover the lower sides of the leaves.

**N.B**:

1.  In flood prone areas under low land situation of North Bank Plains Zone cropping system of Rice-Fallow-Potato is recommended.
2.  Under medium land, medium rainfall, flood free situation, inter cropping of potato and pea is recommended for Sonitpur district.
3.  Inter cropping pea in between every two rows of potato grown with, mulches with usual doses of fertilizer in recommended for potato.

# SWEET POTATO

_Ipomoea batatas_ L.

### Variety:

Pusa Red-average yield 24 t/ha Kalmegh-average yield 30 t/ha Dergaon White-average yield 22 t/ha Dergaon Red-average yield 20 t/ha

### Soil and climate:

Sweet Potato can be grown on a variety of soil having good drainage except clay but it is best suited to fertile sandy loam and deep loam. It requires a warm humid climate with a mean temperature of about 22oC. It is sensitive to frost but can withstand drought to certain extent. Under rain-fed condition, it requires a fairly well/distributed rainfall of 175 to 150 annually.

### Preparation of land:

The land should be ploughed or dug to a depth of 15 to 25 cm and brought to fine tilth ridges of 25-30 cm. Height are made 60 to 75 cm apart and vines are planted on these ridges.

### Planting season:

The rain-fed crop of sweet potato is generally planted in May-June and a second crop is raised in September-October (to be harvested ion 105 days after planting). As an irrigated crop it can also be grown in October-November or even later.

### Planting materials planting:

*   1.  Propagation of this crop is done by means of vine cuttings. In the main field, cutting of 20 to 25 cm length are planted on ridges at a distance of 20 to 30 cm between vines. While planting, the central part of the cuttings is buried deep in the soil exposing the two cut ends. About 50,000 to 62,000 cuttings are required to cover a hectare. Care should be taken so that there is sufficient moisture in the soil at the time of planting for the early establishment of the cutting. Since sweet potato is susceptible to water logging, proper drainage facilities should be provided.
    2.  Adopt 2 tiers planting of deep bulking type (X-5) in between two rows of shallow bulking type (X-4) at 30 cm x 15 cm spacing.

### Manure and Fertilizer:

Sweet Potato is a soil exhausting crop. Therefore, proper manuring should be done for better yield. Cattle manure or compost @ 10t/ha or 1.5t/bigha may be applied at the time of preparation of main field. Application of 75 kg N, 50 kg P2O5 and 75 kg K2O per ha or 10 kg N, 6.5 kg P2O5 and 10 kg K2O/bigha may be done in two split doses as tabulated below :

| Name of Fertilizer | Time of application |
| --- | --- |
| At the time of planting | 3 weeks after planting |
| 1. Urea | 80 kg/ha (10.5 kg/bigha | 80 kg/ha |
| 2. Super Phosphate | 310 kg/ha (40 kg/bigha) |  |
| 3. Muriate of Potash | 135 kg/ha (16 kg/bigha) |  |

### Interculture:

The crop should be given a weeding and earthing up at about 4 to 5 weeks after planting. The second split dose of fertilizer can also be applied at this time. Disturbing the vines occasionally during their active growth period will help to prevent the development of small, slender undesirable tubers at the nodes.

Spray 1000 ppm CCC at 30 and 45 days after planting. This gives an additional yield of 25% over control.

### Rotation and Mixed Cropping:

When the crop is raised under rain-fed condition, leguminous green manure crop like _Crotalaria juncea_ (sunnhemp) can be grown after the harvesting of the crop and later on incorporated in soil at the time of preparation of land for the next crop of sweet potato. In such cases, use of compost or cattle manure can be eliminated. As a mixed crop, it can be taken along with Colocasia, Amorphophallus, etc.

### Plant Protection:

**Weevil**\-Sweet potato weevil is the most serious pest. It damages vines and tubers by tunneling through them.

# TAPIOCA

_Manihot esculenta_ Crantz

Cassava, popularly know as Tapioca in India, is the important tuber crop cultivated in Kerela, part of Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Assam. It is consumed both as freshly cooked tubers and as processed food products like chips, sago and vermicilli. It forms a component of animal and poultry feeds too. Industries use tapioca for producing starch and glucose.

**Variety:** H-97, H-165, Sree Prakash, Sree Sahya, Sree Harsha, Sree Jaya and Sree Vijaya

**Sri Jaya:** Early maturing variety (6-7 months); Average yield-26 to 30 t/ha; Starch- 24-27 (%); Cooking quality- excellent.

**Sri Vijaya:** Early maturing variety (6-7 months); Average yield-25 to 28 t/ha; Starch- 27-30 (%); Cooking quality- excellent.

### Soil and climate:

It can be grown on all types of soils except saline, alkaline and ill-drained soils. It grows best in warm and humid climate with well distributed rainfall (1500 to 2000 mm annually).

### Site selection and preparation of land:

Tapioca can be cultivated profitably on hill slopes, waste land and lands where normal cultivation is difficult. The land should be ploughed two or three times or dug to a depth of 25 to 30 cm.

### Planting material:

Tapioca is propagated from cuttings obtained from mature healthy stems having 2-3 cm diameter. Discard the basal 10 cm and the top one third and use the remaining portion, Prepare the cuttings of about 15-20 cm length giving a slanting cut towards lower and or cutting using hacksaw or knife.

### Spacing:

Planting is done in a square alignment with spacing of 90 cm x 90 cm, 1646 setts/bigha are required for planting.

### Time and method of planting:

April-May is the best planting time for Assam. Cuttings are planted vertically (after smoothening the lower portion) and basal 4 to 6 cm is buried inside the

soil. Flat, ridge or mound method of planting can be adopted considering the soil type, topography and water table.

### Manure and Fertilizer:

Cattle manure or compost may be applied @ 12.5 t/ha (1.5t/bigha) during the preparation of the land. Application of organic is better than spreading the manure in the whole area. Tapioca responds well to 75 kg N, 75 kg P2O5 and 100 kg K2O per ha., when applied in two split doses as tabulated below :

| Name of Fertilizer | Time of application |
| --- | --- |
| At the time of planting | Two months after planting |
| 1. Urea | 81 kg/ha (10 kg/bigha) | 81 kg/ha (10 kg/bigha) |
| 2. Super Phosphate | 235 kg/ha (30 kg/bigha) | 235 kg/ha (30 kg/bigha) |
| 3. Muriate of Potash | 83 kg/ha (10 kg/bigha) | 83 kg/ha (10 kg/bigha) |

### Interculture:

Removing the weeds and loosening the soil by light digging or hoeing may be done two to three times upto third month followed by a light earthing up. Excess shoots should be removed retaining only two shoots per plant at 45 days after planting.

### Irrigation:

Irrigation is not necessary for tapioca when the rainfall is well distributed. Irrigation may be done at the time of planting if there is a long dry period. Depending upon the soil moisture, 3 to 5 irrigations may be provided to overcome the drought period.

### Rotation and mixed cropping:

Tapioca can be rotated with maize, banana, yams etc. with proper fertilization once in two years.

Intercropping with short duration leguminous crops like ground nut or cowpea has been found to be advantageous and economical.

### Plant protection:

Tapioca is not affected by any serious pest and disease. The important ones attacking the crop are mentioned below:

Spider, mites and scale insect occur during dry season which feed on leaf sap causing blotching, curling and leaf shedding and can be controlled by spraying kelthane (2ml/lit.). The two important diseases of tapioca are “Cassava mosaic” and “Cercospora leaf spot”. The mosaic disease is apparently transmitted by the insect vector _Bemisia_ sp. (white fly). As a rule only stem cutting from healthy

plants should be used for planting to minimize the spread. The diseased plants should be uprooted and destroyed when the symptoms are visible. Spraying 0.03% dimethoate 3 to 4 times at monthly intervals in the first 4 months of the crop controls the vector and thereby checks the spread of the disease. Leaf spot disease can be controlled by spraying carbendazim 0.1% or Mancozeb 75 WP (2g/lit.).

### Harvesting:

Tapioca becomes ready for harvest at 8 to 10 months after planting. Harvesting for table purpose is to be done after 8 months and for starch manufacturing, after 10 months of planting. Harvesting is done by removing the soil from the base of the plants and pulling out the tubers by holding the basal portion of the stem.

### Storage of Tapioca:

Freshly harvested least damaged roots are packed with 50% moist sawdust in wooden boxes. Dry or very moist sawdust should not used as it results in deterioration. Once packed, the boxes can be stored in a thatch-roof shed or in open covered by a water proof tarpaulin. By following the above method, cassava roots can be stored up to eight weeks without any deterioration. However, the normal method for overcoming the damage is to leave the plants in the ground until needed and once harvested these are to be dried for longer storage life.

**Yield**: 25 to 35 t/ha.

**Cost benefit ratio:** 1:2.53, Cost of cultivation Rs.21,236.00.

### Value addition of tubers:

1.  **Plain white chips:** The harvested tapioca tubers are peeled and the rind is removed completely. Sliced them into thin slices of 2 mm thickness. Dried in the sun over a clean surface for 6-7 days to bring down the moisture content upto 15%. The converted arrowroot biscuit like chips can be broken easily.
2.  **Parboiled dried chips:** The plain chips are parboiled for 4 minutes, cooled immediately by pouring cold water over them and then dried over clean surface under open sun preferably in single layer, for 5 to 7 days to bring the moisture level below 15%. Dried parboiled chips are consumed after grinding as semolina or suji or these can be deep oil fried and seasoned with spices /salt. Such oil fried chips can be consumed fresh or preserved in air tight polybags.
3.  **Tapioca floor: F**lour can be made from both plain and parboiled chips, by grinding in a hammer type mill. Flour made from plain white chips will have colour and texture just like wheat flour and it can be used for making ‘roti’ and other snacks. Flour made from parboiled chips has texture and colour similar to suji and it can be used just like Halwa, Ladoo etc.

Primarily processed tapioca products (dried chips and flour) should be packed airtight in food grade plastic containers, stored upto six months at room temperature.

*   NPK @12-6-6 g/pit should be applied. Half of nitrogen and full doses of phosphorus and potash should be applied as basal and the remaining half of nitrogen to be top dressed in 2 splits at 30 and 60 days after transplanting.
*   Each seedling should be dipped in a slurry made from 5g Azospirillum and 5g PSB for 1 h before transplanting in a pit.
*   Foliar application of Multiplex 0.2% should be done during active growth stage.
*   Application of growth promoter like 0.2% Tricontanol is also recommended for boosting up growth and yield.

### Intercultural Operations

*   Pre-planting application of Pendimethalin @ 1.25 kg per ha followed by 3 manual weeding at 30, 60 and 90 days after transplanting.
*   Mulching with organic materials or LDPE film can also be practised for suppression of weeds.
*   The crop cannot tolerate very intense sunlight. Therefore, appropriate measures should be taken to raise non-competitive shade plants.
*   Staking with bamboo sticks may be required to provide mechanical support to the plants.

### Insect management

*   For controlling insects like aphids, thrips, white fly, leaf and plant hoppers, apply Imdidachloropid or Thioamethoxam 20-25 g a.i./ha.
*   Apply Profenofos 50 EC (1 ml/lit) against mites and lepidopteran insects.
*   For controlling fruit borer, spray Lambdacyhalophrin @ 0.1 ml/lit at the time of fruit setting followed by another spray after 15-20 days.
*   In organic culture, spray Beauveria basiana @ 3 ml/lit against sucking pests. Neem seed kernel extract (NSKE) 5% may also be sprayed @ 3 ml/lit for repelling insect pests.

### Harvesting and Curing:

The crop should be harvested when leaves after yellowing and gradually dry up. Fingers are separated from rhizome, cleaned and dried for one day.

### Processing:

The clean rhizomes are boiled to make them soft in water containing alkaline substances like, lime, sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate at 0.05% - 0.1% concentration. Alkalinity of boiling water helps for developing orange yellow tinge to the core of the turmeric. The boiled turmeric is dried in the sun until they produce metallic sound. The dried rhizomes are polished by putting the rhizome is gunny bag and struck against floor to remove the scales and roots.

The next stage in processing is giving yellow colour externally to the turmeric tubers to make them attractive in the eyes of the buyers. The polished fingers are taken in a vicker basket which is shaken continuously while a prepared emulsion is poured in. After the fingers are uniformly coated with the emulsion they are again dried in the sun.

The composition of the emulsion required for coating 100 kg of polished turmeric is –

# BLACK PEPPER

_Piper nigrum_ L.

Only hermaphrodite varieties should be cultivated. The following varieties are common.

*   1.  Panniyur-1 (hybrid variety).
    2.  Kalluvalli.
    3.  Balankotta.
    4.  Karimunda.
    5.  Kottandan.
    6.  Arkulam Munda.

### Soil:

Well drained alluvium with a high organic matter content.

### Propagation:

Black pepper is propagated from cuttings rather than from seeds. Runners used for cuttings should be of 3 nodes length and can be planted directly near the standard (support) or in polythene sleeves in the nursery filled with 1:3 part well rotten cowdung or compost and virgin soil.

### Time of taking cutting: March.

**Time required for rooting and new shooting**: 2 to 3 months.

**Time of planting in the main field**: May/June.

### Method of planting:

Planting in virgin land can be done by providing some kind or standard like some fast growing trees, e.g.., fast growing trees, e.g.., Modar (_Erythrinia indica_) or wooden posts. Coconut or arecanut can also be used as standard. The cuttings should be planted 30 cm away from the support.

**Spacing**: 3 m x 3 m.

**Pit Size**: 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm.

**Manure and Fertilizer:** Compost @ 9 kg, Urea 225g, SSP 1kg, MOP 100g and lime 500-1000 g per plant at the following rates.

1st year: ½ of the full dose. 2nd year: ½ of the full dose. 3rd year: ¾rd of the full dose. 4th year onward: Full dose.

April is the best time for application.

### Interculture operation:

Pepper Plant makes rapid growth and the vine should be tied to the support at 30 cm interval. The lower portion up to 90 cm of the vine is to be kept clean and unranked. Encourage the vine to produce lateral fruiting branches and do not allow growing to a height beyond 4m. Mulching near the collar of the vine conserves moisture during the drought period.

Looping of the branches of the standard trees is essential in monsoon to ensure proper fruit-setting.

### Plant Protection:

1.  **Pollu beetle**: The grubs feed on tender berries and make them hollow. endosulfan 35 EC or quinalphos 25 EC or dimethoate30 EC @ 1 ml/lit of water should be sprayed in July and October.
2.  **Marginal gall forming thrips**: It attacks the leaves and makes crinkles. Malathion 50 EC @ 1 ml/lit of water should be sprayed.
3.  **Quick wilt**: In monsoon, infection appears 25-30 cm above ground level and the vine dies within 10-12 days. Spray 1% Bordeaux mixture before onset of monsoon on the ground up to 1 m of the vine,.

# OYSTER MUSHROOM CULTIVATION

Advantage of oyster mushroom over button mushroom (Agaricus spp.) or paddy straw mushroom (_Volvariella_ spp).

*   1.  Cultivation technology is easier to take up.
    2.  Most suitable for the climate of Assam.
    3.  Can be grown for a longer period in a year-7 months.
    4.  Not exigent in its temperature requirement-20 to 33oC.
    5.  Possesses the highest biconversion ability-60%
    6.  Can be easily sundried and preserved.

### Season:

It is grown in a temperature range of 20o to 33oC. The best temperature is around 25oC.

The best months in a year for growing this mushroom at Jorhat are September to March. The remaining five months, viz. April to August are not favourable. It may take a month longer to bear mushroom after opening of beds. Besides, the yield is poor, June is the last favourable month for this mushroom.

### Species of oyster mushroom:

Seven species, viz. _Pleurotus sajorcaju, P. citrinopoleatus, P. florida, P. cornucopie, P. sapidus, P. ostreatus_ and _P. flabellatus_ were successfully grown at Jorhat. For winter, i.e. during December, January and February, _P. florida_ is more suitable than others.

### Substrate:

Rice straw is the best substrate among all the materials. Rice stubbles and mustard husk are also good substrates. Rice straw from Ahu crop (harvested in July) causes contamination of bed.

### Soaking:

Straw is soaked in clear water for 12 hrs. If soaking is done during night, all the steps in preparing Mushroom beds can be completed in the following day time. About 12 kg of straw can be soaked in an empty oil; drum. Place a boulder to check floating of straw.

### Pasteurization on straw:

It means partial sterilization of straw. The purpose is to eliminate unwanted micro organisms from the straw. Without this treatment, performance of mushroom beds will be erratic. The yield is more consistent with pasteurization. It can be done by the following method.

### With boiling water:

Water is boiled to 850C in aluminium vessel or in a cauldron. Wet straw is immersed in this for 30 min. Treated straw is spread on a cement floor for 15 min. to drain excess water. This method is not fully efficient.

There is however a plus point with hot water treatment since the yield is better than in steam pasteurization. The fungus breaks down straw quickly and established itself faster in boiled straw compared to steamed straw.

**Spawn:** Spawn, i.e. seed of mushroom consists of mycelium of the fungus grown on grains.

Spawn, i.e. seed of mushroom consists of mycelium of the fungus grown on grains. It is produced in saline bottle or polypropylene bags. If there is no immediate use, the spawn can be stored at room temperature up to two months from the date of inoculation.

**Spawning:** It means seedling of substrate with spawn.

### Polythene bag method:

*   Get polythene bag of 40 x 60 cm. This can hold 3 kg of wet straw.
*   Punch holes at a distance of 10 cm.
*   Remove spawn from bottle or bag, squeeze it to separate grains.

### How much spawn to use :

*   Add @ 3% the weight of wet substrate. 90 g of spawn is required to seed 3 kg of wet straw.
*   Put 10 cm. Layer of the straw in the polythene bag and press it.
*   Fill the bags to 3/4th capacity with alternate layers of straw and spawn.
*   Tie the bag and place in spawn-running room.

**Spawn running:** Filled bags or cubes are arranged on rack in a dark room for 12 to 15 days. 20o to 30oC is good for spawn run. A cottony growth proliferates through straw. The bed is taken out by inverting the bag. The opened bed is transferred to cropping room.

### Cropping:

Direct sunlight should not fall in to the cropping room. Ventillation and diffused light is required for fruiting. Small pinheads surface of mushrooms can be harvested at weekly interval. Water should be sprayed three times a day. One kg of dry straw will produce 600 to 800g of mushroom in three flushes. Mushrooms

are plucked before their edges curl upwards. Overmatured mushrooms shed spores forming a white coating on the ground. To get optimum yield and better nutritive quality paddy straw mushroom should be harvested when the volva are still intact.

### String:

Use paper bags for packing. They can be kept for a maximum of 7 days in a refrigerator.

# MICROPROPAGATION IN HORTICULTURAL CROPS

A number of plants are vegetatively propagated using rhizomes, bulbs, stem cutting or through conventional techniques, such as grafting, layering, budding etc. These include majority of fruit crops, ornamental plants etc. However, because of low multiplication rate and progressive build up of pest and pathogens, there is often scarcity, of healthy planting material in these crops. Alternatively, an economical method is available for rapid control multiplication, average yield of several important crops and forage tree can be tremendously increased by selecting propagation of already existing elite genotypes. Development of tissue culture techniques has revolutionized the clonal propagation for past 2-3 decades and plant regeneration in vitro has been reported for over 100 species. The following are some of the highlights of micropropation of some of the horticultural crops which have been undertaken during last few years.

1.  The technique of regeneration from internodes segment of _Citrus reticulata_ cv. Khasi mandarin and _Citrus limon_ cv. Assam lemon was standardized by culturing them on modified M.S. medium supplemented with 0.25 mg/l BAP + 0.5 mg /l NAA +0.5 mg/l IBA.
2.  The techniques for regeneration of kashi mandarin was standardized by culturing the nucellar tissue on (Murashige and Tucker (MT), (1969) medium supplemented with 500 mg malt extract. Nucullar calli are the ideal for protoplast culture.
3.  The technique for shoot tip and nodal segment culture was standardized for citron (_C. medica_) on modified MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/l BAP + 0.5 mg /l kinetin + 0.5mg/l NAA.
4.  The technique for in-vitro propagation of _Poncirus trifoliata_ from shoot tip of mature plant (8-9 years old) was standardized by culturing on modified MS media with 1 mg /l NAA-1+1 mg/l kinetin.
5.  Modified Mutative and Scourged (1962 (MS) media + 0.25 mg/l IAA+2mg/ l BAP for shoot proliferation and MS basal + 1.5 mg/l IAA for rooting was standardized for Heliconia by taking auxiliary and terminal bud.

The use of plastics in Horticulture is one of the new technologies, which had made rapid development in the agricultural sector and made a direct contribution to improve crop production in many ways. Plastics are now a days extensively used as roofing materials in the greenhouse, polyhouse or low tunnel, as mulching materials in the crop field and as lining materials in a surface irrigation channels. The major thrust area of plasticulture is in drip and sprinkler irrigation.

The following technologies for the use of plastics in horticultural sector are recommended for Assam.

### Off season Production of vegetable under Plastic Greenhouse:

Forcing of vegetables for early as well as off-season market has been found to be possible under UV-stabilized transplant LDPE-polyhouse cum rainshelter in Assam. The gable Even design polyhouse can be easily built with locally available framing materials like bamboo or wood. The UV stabilized plastic materials of 200-micron thickness should be used as the cladding materials. The durability of this plastic material is 5-6 years. The details of erection cost for 20m x 5m i.e., 100 sq.m. floor area polyhouse of bamboo frame is given below.

# COCONUT-BASED MULTIPLE CROPPING

(An Ideal Household Garden for Assam Conditions)

In a state like Assam, where individual land holding is marginal, multiple cropping is the only option for increasing the production and productivity of either field or horticultural crops. Secondly, in Assam unlike field crops, horticulture is confined to household or ‘bari’ level. As such, for development of horticulture in the state, it is the first and formost need to develop the household gardens which apart from increasing the production per unit area gives some other advantages such as maximum use of available land, economic use of nutrients from the soil and sunlight from the air. Multiple cropping is also a way to avoid any lean period of production as well as income.

A model household garden with multiple cropping system required systematic planning with regard to selection of crops, planting, manuring and other management practices,. The following points are to be considered while raising a model household garden.

### Base Crop:

In multiple cropping system, one crop is taken as base crop. Coconut can be selected as a base crop because of its tall growing unranked natured. It is particularly suitable for Assam condition because of its wide adaptability. Wider spacing of the base crop provides more opportunity for raising other crops.

### Other Crops:

Locally adapted crops should be selected for growing in between the rows of the base crop. The root system of these crops should be of different depth so that they can draw nutrients from different depth of soil. These crops should have differential height so that reach crop can get their required slight. These crops form their canopy at different height, for which the system is also termed as “Multistoried cropping should be able to withstand partial shade or shade to some extent. Banana (var. Chenichampa), pineapple (Var. Kew), lemon (var. Assam Lemon), Ginger (var. Nadia) are found to be suitable for growing in coconut based garden in Assam condition. Black pepper (var. Panniyur-I) can suitably be allowed to grow along the stem of the coconut tree.

### Planting Method :

The taller plants should be planted nearer to the base crop and shorter ones should be grown gradually away from the base crop. This system of planting gives more effective.

### Model of Coconut-Based Multistoreyed cropping


**Model – I**

Use of sunlight 3 to 5 different crops can be raised in the coconut based garden depending upon the adaptability of crops.

**Green house variety:** First Red, Confetti, Nobless, Grand Gala**. Propagating Material**:

Commercially rose is propagated by T- or Shield budding but for root stock preparation one year old cuttings having pencil thickness are used_._.

### Planting:

The pit should be dug 75 to 90 cm deep, thoroughly dried and filled with, well rotten FYM at the bottom and good garden soil at the top. New plants may be planted at the beginning or during the rainy season at a distance of 75 to 90 cm from each other depending on type of variety. Soil around the plants should be firmly pressed and watering is done immediately after planting

**Soil Type**: Any well-drained garden soil.

### Aftercare:

In budded roses, the suckers arising from the rootstock should be removed as soon as they emerge, Dead, weak, cris crossing, diseased or insect-infested branches should be removed or pruned.

### Manure and Fertilizer:

Immediately after pruning, during the months of October-November, the top soil around the base of the plant is dug out up to a depth of 10 to 15 cm and kept exposed for 2-3 days, then filled with half a basket of well decomposed FYM and then covered with the excavated soil. The soil compacted around the base and flooded with water. Urea @ 10 g per plant is to be applied 20 cm away from trunk and mixed carefully before watering. Super phosphate at the same rate may be applied after the flower buds have just begun emerge since it promotes flower production.

A foliar feeding with 2 parts Urea, 1 part dihydrogen ammonium phosphate, 1 part potassium nitrate and 1 part Potassium phosphate @ 3 g per lit. of water is an excellent supplement to root feeding. This solution is thoroughly sprayed on both sides of the leaves and stems periodically, insecticides can also be added to the solution if required. Foliar feeding should start 5 weeks after pruning and given at 10 days interval. Foliar feeding should not be done when the plant is in bloom.

### Irrigation:

A periodical soaking of soil is done to keep the soil moist but not rootwet.

### Plant Protection:

Red scales, which cover the branches and suck cell sap from the plant, are the most serious pests of rose. Spraying of malathion or dimethoate 0.1% during April and again in October will control this insect.

Rose chafer beetle which eats away the leaves may be controlled by spraying 0.2% malathion and light traps may also be used.

Die back, powdery mildew and Black spot are the common diseases of rose. Dieback appears after pruning; therefore fungicidal paint should be applied on the pruned surfaces. Sulphur dusting is an effective remedy for mildew. Black spots of leaves can be controlled by spraying with 0.2% Captan 50WP as soon as these are noticed

### Harvesting and post harvest handling:

Rose flowers are harvested at tight bud stage when the bud show full colour but the petals have not yet started unfolding. Grading is based on length of stem and size of bud. Roses are packed in corrugated cardboard boxes (100 cm × 32.5 cm × 6.5 cm) in bundles, each bundle containing 20 blooms. Boxes are inner lined with thin polythene and very fine moist tissue paper.

Roses are graded according to the length of the stem as follows: Length of stem (cm) Grade

Above 70 White

60-70 Blue

50-60 Yellow

40-50 Red

30-40 Brown

Below 30 Working grade only for local market

### Propagating Material:

Bougainvillea is propagated by hardwood or semi hardwood cuttings from a matured branch of the past seasons growth taken during early or late monsoon. Difficult to root varieties are propagated by layering.

### Planting:

The cuttings are planted in the nursery under shade and care is taken to keep the soil moist by regular sprinkling of water. New shoots emerge from the nodes. About 2-3 basket of FYM or compost is applied/pit. The rooted cuttings are planted 3 weeks after preparation of the pit. Extra soil is added to the base of the plant to avoid water logging.

### Site and soil:

Light, well-drained soils are considered ideal for growing bougainvillea. The plant flowers profusely when growing in full sun. Shady, damp waterlogged areas are to be avoided.

### Plant Protection:

Bougainvillea is usually not affected by any serious insect-pest and disease.

# MUSSAENDA

Double type: Calcutta Double, Mexican Double, Suvasini (Hyb) Vybhav (Hyb), Suvarna Rekha.

### Planting:

Bulbs more than 2.5 cm diameter of tuberose are generally planted 5 cm. deep at a spacing of 30 x 20 cm or 25 x 25 cm. However, for high density planting spacing is maintained as 20 x 20 cm or 20 x 10 cm. from February to March.

### Soil and Site:

It is grown in a wide range of soils. Well-drained sandy and sandy loam soil rich in organic matter with a pH of 6.0–7.5 and having ample sunlight is suitable_._

### Mulching:

Mulching of Tuberose with 50 micron black polyethylene sheet for quality cut flower and year-round production including the lean period (December to February).

### Manure and Fertilizer:

Application of NPK @ 30:20:20 g/m2 with half of N and full doses of P2O5 and K2O to be applied at the time of land preparation and the remaining N to be top-dressed in 2 split doses at 35 and 55 days after planting of cutting

### Irrigation:

Watering should be done at weekly interval during dry spells in the growing season.

### Plant Protection:

There are no serious insect pests and diseases of tuberose. However, as a prophylactic measure, it is necessary to spray Carbendazim 50WP @ 1.5 g/lit. in the advanced stage of plant growth to control the incidence of collar rot disease caused by _Sclerotium rolfsii_. It is also necessary to spray malathion 50 EC @ 1 g/lit. to control the aphids which suck cell sap from the tender spikes.

For management of Sclerotial wilt, dipping of bulbs in captan (0.3%) for 30 minutes before planting followed by drenching soil also with captan (0.3%)@ 10 lit/ sq. m at monthly interval for three months is recommended. Alternatively before planting bulbs are dipped in _Trichoderma viride_ (10 g/lit) followed by soil application of T_. viride_ 100 g / Sq.m mixed with 1 kg FYM at the time of planting.

For management of leaf blight, spraying of Chlorothalonil or Iprodione+ carbendazim (Quintal) @ 0.2 % (2ml in 1 litre) or carbendazim 0.1% (1 g in 1 litre) at 10 days interval is recommended.

### Intercropping:

In commercial cultivation of tuberose, certain vegetable crops like-pea, spinach beet, French bean and carrot can be taken up as intercrops. However, maximum return can be attained with tuberose- pea combination.

### Ratooning:

Fresh planting should be done after every 3 years but for quality flower production replanting is done every year. Regular and frequent weeding should be done. Half dose of the recommended fertilizer should be applied during the second year and third year of the ratoon crop.

### Vase- life:

A preservative solution containing potassium permanganate (25ppm) is suitable for extending the vase life of cut tuberose spike.

    2.  **Standard:** Snow Ball, Stanly Gossling, Diamond Jubilee, Dignity, Sonar Bangla, White Spider, Dr. Erabe Cross, Heather Gem, Golden Giant.

### Propagation material:

Annual chrysanthemums are propagated from seeds and perennial chrysanthemums are propagated by the separation of suckers and terminal stem cutting. Planting of suckers are done in the month of February. Terminal stem cuttings of 5-7 cm long are taken during June to September. Lower leaves of the cuttings are removed and the cuttings are treated with rooting hormone (Rootex) before planting in sand or sand+peat moss/vermiculite/soil to promote rooting.

### Planting of rooted cuttings:

The planting of rooted cuttings for better yield and quality of flower is done from July to September

### Potting and Repotting:

The planting materials prepared from suckers in the month of February and from stem cuttings in the month of June to August are potted and repotted 3 to 4 times, each time into bigger sized pots and richer potting media. Newly potted plant should be kept in shade for 3 to 4 days till they are established

### Aftercare:

Growing shoots should be pinched off in between second and third week in order to make the plants bushy. Plants should be watered daily preferably during morning hours. It is necessary to stake the plants to keep them erect.

### Feeding to chrysanthemums:

Occasional top dressing of SSP @ 3 g per pot especially at final potting, helps in growth and flowering of chrysanthemum.

A supplementary feeding with-liquid manure is done at 10 days intervals just after light watering. Liquid manure is made in the following way:

Liquid manure is prepared by dissolving 1 kg of fresh cowdung manure and 100 g of mustard oil cake in 10 lits of water. Occasional string is necessary. After 10 days the supernatant liquid is taken out and diluted to attain a straw colour by mixing 1 mug of this liquid with 10 mug of plain water. Feeding with liquid manure should start with the establishment of the plant and to continue up to the appearance of first flower bud.

### Use of Plant growth Regulators:

Spraying of plants 30 days after final transplanting with GA3 at 40 ppm improve growth and increase the number and size of flowers. However, to induce early flowering, 10 ppm GA3 is recommended which also increase self-life in spray cultivars.

Spraying of 5000 ppm CCC increases the flower size in standard cultivars and branch and flower number in spray cultivars, spraying of 10,000 ppm B-9 is better than normal pinching method.

### Plant Protection:

Aphids attack the tender growing points and cause curling of leaves. These can be controlled by spraying malathion 50 EC @ 1.5 ml/lit. Caterpillars eat up buds and young shoots and these should be controlled by spraying dimethoate @ 1 ml/lit. at 10 days interval. Leaf miners, which burrow into the leaf, can be controlled by spraying dimethoate @ 1.2 ml/lit.

Leaf spot can be controlled by spraying carbendazim @ 1.5 g/lit. virus infected plants are uprooted and destroyed. Aphids and Thrips are the vectors of viral diseases and must be effectively controlled.

### Harvesting and post harvest handling:

The correct stage of harvesting depends on the cultivar, marketing and other facilities available to the grower. The decorative type is harvested when petals at center of the top-most flower are fully developed. Standard type is harvested when outer ray florets ceased to elongate. Flowers are cut about 10 cm above the soil and 1/3 of stems are stripped of leaves and placed immediately in water. Cut flowers are graded into several grades depending on stem length, colour and diameter of the flower. The standard chrysanthemums are packed in display boxes measuring 91 cm x 43 cm x 15 cm size. For spray chrysanthemum, a bundle of 20 stems are packed in cardboard boxes measuring 80cmx 50cm x23 cm.

For local markets, packaging of spray chrysanthemum in PP-100 gauge polythene to increase shelf- life and maximum floret opening in vase.

Pal, Jyotsna, Clarissia, Potgainter.

### Propagating Material:

Dahlia can be propagated through seeds, tubers and stem cuttings.

### Sowing/Planting:

Generally, the single and dwarf bedding dahlias are propagated by seeds. Seeds are sown in well-prepared nursery beds or seeds boxes during October- November and the seedlings are transplanted into the permanent beds or pots when they reach the 4 to 6 leaves stage. Cuttings are taken from plants raised from tubers in nursery beds from August onwards and planted out in their permanent places in October-November, In case of bedding dahlias, a spacing of 90 cm from row to row and 50-75 cm from plant to plant is given. 60 cm x 60 cm spacing is kept in case of dwarf dahlias.

### Soil and Site:

Dahlias grow best in a sunny location although they are remarkably tolerant to semi-shade. They do not like much rain and extreme cold or heat.

A good, well-drained sandy loam soil is best suited for dahlia.

### Aftercare:

When the plants reach 10 to 15 cm height, they are staked by tying 2 or 3 places to bamboo or wooden sticks with a soft-rope. Staking is done to prevent the plant from tappling or lodging over. Earthing up is necessary to give support to its weak and succulent stems.

### Manure and Fertilizer:

When dahlia is grown on rich soils, additional feeding is not required; but in poor soils a top dressing of 35 g to 50 g/m2 of any complete chemical fertilizer is beneficial. Care should be taken to see that the chemical fertilizer should not come into contact with the base of the plant. Liquid feeding should be done.

### Irrigation:

Adequate watering with a watering cane should be done throughout the growing season.

### Plant Protection:

Aphids, wire worms and caterpillers generally suck cell sap or eat up tender portions of stem and leaf. Spraying malathion or fenitrothion @ 1.5 ml./l. of water control these insects-pests.

Leaf spot, mildew and mosaic virus are common diseases of dahlia. Control measures are the same as in chrysanthemum.

### Storage of Tuber:

Bulk quantity of dahlia tubers are to be stored in cold storage at a temperature of 7.7oC to 10oC. Small quantity of tubers should be stored in pots covered with sand. Tubers are not allowed to shrivel in any case.

### Propagating Materials:

Large sized corms having 3-5 cm diameter is used when gladioli are grown for cut flowers. Large corms can be vertically cut into two or three pieces which are then used for propagation. Small and medium size cormels are grown for further corm production in the next season.

### Soil and Site:

Gladiolus can be grown in a wide range of soils but deep, rich, well pulverized and well drained loam is considered the best soil which should be moisture retentive having medium acid to neutral pH.

### Aftercare:

After the corms sprout, the rows should be hilled up about 10-15 cm. Staking is necessary when flower spikes start swelling. The soil around the plants should be lightly dug up with a khurpi but this should be discontinued when flower spikes start swelling.

### Manure and Fertilizer:

N: P: K should be applied in the ratio 1: 2:2 @ 56 g/sq.m. in two equal split doses. One split dose should be thoroughly mixed with the soil before planting of corms and the other at 4 to 6 leaf stage.

### Plant Growth Regulators:

Soaking corms with GA3 (2500 ppm) has shown the best performance on growth, flowering and corm production of gladiolus. However, Ethrel (2000 ppm) increases the number of cormels at harvest.

For quality spike production of gladiolus, treatment of corms with 100 ppm

GA3.

For healthy cormel production, treatment of gladiolus corms with Ethrel @

250 ppm.

Application of Atrazine @1.5 kg a.i./ha before planting for controlling weeds and quality gladiolus spikes and corms.

### Irrigation:

Watering should be done at 10-12 days interval to keep the soil moist.

### Plant Protection:

Fusarium corm rot is the most common and serious disease in the field. Bacterial scab also causes corm rot. Pre-sowing treatment against fungal disease included dipping the corms in carbendazim or Benomyl 0.3% (3 g in 1 litre water) for 20 minutes.

Thrips and cutworms are serious pests of gladiolus. Dusting of malathion 5% dust at the base of the plants is effective against thrips, while spraying of malathion 50 EC 1% at 15 days interval effectively controls cutworms.

### Harvesting and Post harvest handling of spikes:

For local market, gladiolus spikes are harvested when the 1st pair of florets fully opened. For distant market flowers are harvested at tight bud stage when 1-5 florets show colour with atleast two numbers of clasping leaves. Gladiolus spikes are usually graded based on spike length and number of florets per spike according to the following groups:

| Grade | Spike length (cm)(Minimum) | No. of florets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fancy (A) | 107 & above | 16 |
| Special (B) | 96-107 | 14 |
| Standard (C) | 81-96 | 12 |
| Utility (D) | 81 & below | 10 |

The graded spikes are made into bundles of 50-100 spikes and packed in perforated and light proof cardboard boxes.

### Harvesting and Storage of Corms:

When leaves turn yellow, the corms along with cormels are lifted in the last week of April to second week of May. Corms and cormels are soaked in 0.2% Captan or carbendazim or 0.1% Benlate solution for 15-30 minutes and stored in airy room on wooden trays in a single layer. The best way to store is in a refrigerator or cold storage at 4.40 C to 100 C. During storage, the brown scales covering the corms should not be removed.

### Vase-life:

Use of holding solution containing Sodium hypochlorite (50 ppm) and Potassium permanganate (25 ppm) along with Sucrose (4%) extends vase life.

**Cost of cultivation:** Rs. 66,300.

**Cost: benefit:** 1:3.21.

# ORCHIDS

Orchids are the most beautiful among all the flowering plants in the world. There are consist of about 22.000 to 35,000 species and 700-800 genera and thus include innumerable varieties.

From the floricultural point of view orchids are classified into two broad categories, viz. epiphytes and terrestrials. The epiphytes live an independent life as far as their food requirement is concerned and they perch themselves on trees and rocks. On the other hand, the terrestrial types grown on earth, like ordinary plant.

### Some Important Genera:

_Epiphytic: Dendrobium, Vanda, Rhynchostylis, Coelogyne, Areodes_ etc.

_Terrestrial_: _Cymbidium, Paphiopedilum, Thunia, Phaius, Spathoglottis, Arundina_

etc.

**Hybrid variety:** Sonia, Makara, Oncidium.

### Propagating Material:

Monopodial epiphytes like Vanda, Rhynchostylis, etc. are propagated by stem cutting or layering. Sympodial orchids, both epiphytes and terrestrials, are propagated by division of pseudobulbs or offsets.

### Potting of Orchids:

1.  **Potting material :** For epiphytic orchids side-perforated earthen pots and for terrestrial orchids, ordinary earthen pot should be used.

Pot mixture : For epiphytic species, coconut fiber, sawdust, charcoal and brick pieces in equal proportion with moss as covering material should be used.

For terrestrial species, a mixture of loam soils, river sand and coconut fiber (size 3 cm x 3 cm) and peatmoss or leaf mould in equal proportion with moss as covering materials should be used.

### Growing media for pseudobulb production:

**Epiphytic orchid**: Coconut fibre + charcoal in equal proportion is the best growing media for higher pseudobulb production.

**Terrestrial orchid**: Loamy soil + sand + coconut fibre + shredded wood in equal proportion is the best growing media for higher pseudobulb production.

**Growing condition:** Orchids are grown commercially in low cost (bamboo frame) or medium cost (angle iron) agroshadenet house with 30-50% shade.

**Harvesting and post harvest handling**: Orchid flowers are harvested 3-4 days after opening of flowers. Grading is done based on length of flower spike, flower number, size and arrangement of flower on the spike. Packaging method is different for different species of orchids. Dendrobium is packed in 4 dozen sprays per box. The cut ends of the flower stems are to be covered with wet cotton and wrapped with polythene to maintain humidity. Cymbidium spikes are generally packed 100 flowers per box.

### Aftercare:

The pots of epiphytic orchids should be watered regularly and those of terrestrials at longer intervals. Occasionally emerged weeds should be removed from time to time.

The epiphytic orchids should be held in position by using stakes. Newly potted plants should be kept in semi shade for few days until new roots starts growing.

If the basal portion of monopodial orchids become leafless. It is suggested to cut off the portion so that healthy roots are formed.

Application of bio-fertilizers - Azospirillum and Phosphobacterium each @ 2 g per plant in two months interval along with a regular spraying of NPK (20:10:10) @ 0.2% twice a week for better growth and flower production in the orchid - _Dendrobium_ Var. Sonia.

### Plant Protection:

**Disease**: Fungi, viruses and bacteria attack orchids; growing of healthy plant under good hygienic condition is the best way to prevent diseases.

1.  Pythium black rot which infects roots and spread into the rhizome and pseudobulbs can be checked by spraying 10 ppm copper sulphate solution at weekly intervals.
2.  Anthracnose, which causes leaf spots and soft leaves, can be controlled by copper fungicide spray.
3.  Rust causes reddish brown spots and quickly spreads from plant to plant. This can be controlled by dusting with sulphur or spraying with Mancozeb 75 WP (2g/l).
4.  Bacterial soft rot causes slimy rot of pseudobulbs and stembases. The affected plants should be destroyed and other plants sprayed with 10 ppm mercuric chloride.
5.  For viral diseases, affected plants should be destroyed.
6.  Cercospora leaf spot can be controlled by spraying captan 50WP @ 2 g/lit water.

**Insect-Pest**: The following are the chief pests of orchids. The control measures are given against each of them.

### Pests Control measures

Ants Chlordane dust or nicotine sprays

Snails, slugs Mataldehyde baits containing arsenic

Earthworms Watering with Derris solution

Thrips Liquid malathion

Mites Parathion, Kelthane etc.

Mealy bugs, Leaf hopper & Beetle Malathion spray

Aphid Rogor @ 1.5 ml/lit of water

Caterpillar 5% Malathion dust

**Blooming time :** Most of the orchids bloom either between February to June or between October to November.

**Potting :** For potting, the selected plants should be carefully examined and decayed roots and dead membrane should be removed. The used need to be soaked in water and broken crocks, a 2 cm thick layer of decayed moss should be placed,. Then the pots should be half filled with the mixture in the form of hillock in the centre of the pot. The plant should be held with one hand and placed over the hillock and with the other hand the pot should be filled up by spreading the roots upward and downward. The mixture should be carefully pressed and 3 cm layer of moss should be spread over the pot.

**Irrigation :** In potted orchids, watering should be done in the evening hour when the soil becomes dry. Beds may be watered at 3-4 days interval during dry spells.

Varieties like Fire, Calore and Tropical for red colour; Acropolis, Moment for white and Evita Pink for pink colour are recommended for growing in soil less culture under shade net house.

### Climate:

Anthurium needs conditions of high relative humidity well above 70%. It is grown commercially in low cost (bamboo frame) or medium cost (angle iron) net houses with 75-80% agro shade net roofs. To protect the plants from heavy rains, UV stabilized 200 micron plastic film can be used in combination with agro shade net cloth. The sides of the net house should also be covered with shade net (50% or lower) to improve the microclimate inside it. These nets can be raised for proper ventillation when the temperature rises.

**Planting season:** Anthuriums can be planted almost round the year except in winter and during heavy rains.

### Planting material/Propagation:

Anthurium is commercially propagated by separation of suckers produced at the base of the plant. When these suckers grow to 5-6 leaf stages with 2-3 good roots, they can be separated and planted. Suckers should be removed by pulling them out by hand and not by knife or scissors. Tissue cultured plantlets, which are true to type and disease free, can be procured.

To grow anthurium plants from seeds is a lengthy process. Seedlings may take 21/2 – 3 years to come from seed to bloom. Mature seeds may be scattered in the growing media. The seeds germinate immediately and can be transplanted within 4 to 6 months.

### Growing media:

The growing media for anthurium should be rich in organic matter, slightly acidic, porous, well aerated and well drained. According to the availability, different materials like coir pith, sand, gravel, decomposed organic materials like rice husk, coconut husk, sugarcane bagasse, wood shaving, tree bark, water hyacinth, leaf mould, saw dust etc. can be mixed and used as a growing media. Growing media consisting of 2 parts rice husk/pine bark + 1part soil + 1 part sand + 1 part cowdung + ½ part charcoal produced the best vegetative growth and good flower characters under Jorhat conditions.

### Growing media for sucker production:

FYM +soil+ coconut fibre in equal proportion is the best growing media for sucker production.

### Pot culture of anthurium:

In small scale planting, anthuriums are generally planted in earthen pots of 25 to 30 cm with two or more holes. Crock pieces are placed at the bottom of the pot above which a 2 cm layer of coarse sand is spread. Over this, brick or charcoal pieces are arranged so that the root ball can be placed easily. The sides of the root ball are covered with pieces of coconut husk and a filler mixture of sand and cowdung is spread over it to fill up the gaps. Initially the pot is filled to about 1/4th to 1/3rd and subsequently with increasing growth, fresh medium is added once in about three months. Besides providing good anchorage, this encourages growth of the plant and gives an earthing up effect.

### Planting in beds:

Large scale commercial cultivation of anthurium is done in beds.

1.  The bed should be 1.2 to 1.4 m wide depending on the length and breadth of the greenhouse and distance between posts.
2.  The sides of the bed can consist of a wood/bricks.
3.  There should be a path at least 0.80 cm wide between two beds.
4.  Plastic foil (0.1 cm) thick should be placed on the bed to separate the media from the ground.
5.  A drainage hose should be placed on the bottom of the bed to drain out the excess water located at the lowest point.
6.  The bottom of the bed should slope from the side to the centre of the bed (2-3 cm), so that water flows to the drainage hose. The gradient of the slope should not be more than 0.03% (3 cm per 100 m).
7.  A sprinkler system, which provides adequate distribution of water, can be installed in the middle of the bed.
8.  The height of the growing medium should be minimum 20 cm. It can be refilled within 2-3 years to a maximum of 30 cm.
9.  A wire should be tied along the bed (fastened to posts placed 4 m apart) to keep the flowers out of the path.
10.  Spacing in beds: 40 – 45 cm x 40 – 45 cm depending on the cultivar.

### Aftercare:

**Application of growth regulators:**

Plant growth regulators play an important role in increasing growth, sucker production, flower yield and quality and in reduction of juvenile phase of anthuriums. Plants sprayed with Maleic hydrazide 1000 ppm at one and three months after planting produced shorter plants with more number of suckers. Plants sprayed with GA3 (500 and 300 ppm) and BA (200 ppm) showed better vegetative growth and flower characters.

**Pruning of leaves:** About 4 to 5 leaves are sufficient on a plant. The older leaves should be periodically removed.

**Removal of suckers:** Suckers produced at the base of the parent plants should be removed at an early stage.

### Manure and fertilizers:

Fertilizers should be applied in smaller doses at frequent interval rather than larger doses at longer intervals. For pot cultivation, 5 g of complex fertilizer (NPK 17:17:17) in 500 ml of water (1%) is sprayed on the foliage once in a month. Foliar application of 0.1% urea at monthly interval is found to be beneficial. In case of Ca deficiency, lime @ 5 g/plant/month is recommended. Soil drenching of liquid manure consisting of cowdung/urea once in every month is beneficial. A handful of dried sieved cowdung is applied at the base of the plant at monthly interval. It is advisable to reduce the quantity of nitrogen in flowering plants, to increase the post harvest life.

### Irrigation:

For Assam condition, anthuriums require one irrigation/day, either in the morning or evening hours.

### Plant protection:

Anthurium blight (_Xanthomonas campestris pv. Dieffenbachia_) : Controlled by spraying plants streptomycin-sulphate or oxytetracyclin (200 mg/l) at weekly interval.

Root rot (_Phythopthora sp, Rhizoctonia sp, Fusarium sp, Pythium sp_) : Controlled by soil drenching with 0.25% Mancozeb and 0.25% Thiram or 0.2% Captan.

Nematodes (_Meloidgyne, Radopholus similes and Aphelenchoides_) : (1) use disease free plant material. (2) Adequate phytosanitary measures. (3) removal of infested plants and growing media.

Aphids and mealy bugs: Controlled by (i) destroying the infested portions (ii) drenching the growing media with malathion @ 2 ml/l.

Snails: Controlled by (i) hand picking and destruction and using baits like Metaldehyde pellets.

**Harvesting and post harvest handling:** When the spathe is fully opened or when 1/3rd to 2/3rd of the true flowers on the spadix are open. The flower stalk should be cut with a sharp knife, leaving about 3 cm of the stalk on the plant and the basal portion of the flower stalk should be immersed in water as soon as possible to prevent drying out. Cut ends of flowers can also be immersed in 100 ppm BA or 4% sucrose for 30 minutes and then kept in water, to extend the vase life.

Application of 50 ppm Sodium hypochlorite + 5% sucrose or 300 ppm of Aluminium Sulphate + 5% sucrose as holding solution for increased vase life of the spathe.

# GROWING OF POTTED PLANTS:

Now a days, the growing of house plants for indoor decoration is gaining much popularity because for rapid urbanization, lack of space around the house as well as their cost of maintenance and transportability. It is possible to grow a variety of attractive decorative and interesting plants within the condoned of the house with the help of which the entire indoor environment can be altered completely to give the home a fresh look.

# KINDS OF HOUSE PLANTS:

1.  Annuals: Various seasonal or annual flowering plants can be grown in pots. Annuals are raised from seeds, either sown directly or first in nursery beds, wooden trays or containers and then transplanted into pots when seedlings are at the 3 to 4-leaves stage or one month old. Annuals include Ageratum, Amaranthus, African daisy, Aster, Carnation, Cornflower, Cosmos, Clarkia, Cuphea, Heliotrope, Lupin, Ladys Lace, Marigold, Nasturtium, Nicotiana, Phlox,

Pink Dianthus, Poppy, Petunia, Pansy, Sweet William, Snapdragon, Stock, Zinnia, etc.

1.  Perennials: Perennial houseplants are either raised by division, cuttings or simply from plantlets that are produced naturally from the mother plant. These include Begonias, Geranium, Cyclamen, Bromeliads, Succulents, Cactus, Coleus, Chrysanthemum, Ferns, Palms, Orchids, Foliage plants and many flowering shrubs and climbers. Perennial plants can be grown in combination in dish gardens and bottle gardens.

### Soil for Potting

Soil for potted plants should be light, well drained and rash in organic matter. A potting mixture containing equal parts of rich garden loam soil and coarse sand is suitable for succulents and cacti. In the absence of rich loamy soil, another part of well rotten organic manure may be added get better results. A potting mixture containing 2 parts loam+1 part each of sand and well rotten manure of leaf mould is best suited for fibrous roots plants like Ferns. Geranium. Begonia, Seasonal flower, etc., For flowering shrubs and foliage plants like palms, Crotons, Hydrangea and Bougainvillea which have deep root systems, a potting mixture containing 3 parts loam + 1 part well rotten organic manure+1 part sand is suitable.

### Fertilizer:

A complete fertilizer mixture of N:P:K: (10:10:10) is beneficial for house plants. This should be applied in liquid form (one tablespoonful in 1 litre of water) at monthly interval during the rapidly growing phase of the plants.

### Container:

House plants can be grown in different kinds of containers such as earthen pots wooden boxes etc. The size of the pot should be proportionate to the size of the plants. To faciliate better drainage, there should be one or more holes at the bottom of the container. The pot should be glazed or painted because this will block the exchange of gases through the pores of the container.

### Aftercare:

All indoor plants require care and attention. The plants must be watered often to prevent the plants from wilting. Some plants for example ferns, shed most of their leaves during a dry spiel while in others the lower leaves turn yellow and drop off. On the other hand, watering causes the roots to decompose and the soil becomes very acidic and ultimately the plant withers up and dies. The frequency of watering should depend on the weather and season and nature of the soil. Watering should be done either in the morning or evening hours but never during mid day.

From time to time, leaves should be wiped with a soft sponge or wet cloth to remove the dust particles gathering on their surface, which block the pores and prevent respiration and transpiration. Fungicides and insecticides can be added to the water at proper concentration to control diseases and insects.

Repotting, i.e. changing the potting mixture is essential for perennial house plants. Repotting is done every alternate year with a new pot mixture. However, if old soil is to be reused, organic manure and lime (10 g per pot) should be incorporated in order to reduce the acidity.

# PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF JAM

Jam is prepared by boiling the whole fruit pulp with sugar to a moderately thick consistency. Pectin present in the fruit or added, helps to develop the jelly fibre with a good gelatinous set. Acid ( 0.5-1.0 per cent) is added to invert a part of sugar (40 per cent) to prevent crystallization of sucrose in the finished product in addition to hardening the jelly fibre system. Banana, Guava, Mango, Apple, Pineapple, Apricot, Peach, Berry fruits, Rosellies, etc. are widely used for making jam. Jam can be made from practically all varieties of fruits and some varieties of vegetables Blended jam from various fruits can also be made.

The procedure and the amount of ingredients required for the preparation of jam generally have a slight variation according to the fruits. A general procedure for jam preparation is outlined below:

### Fruit preparation:

Mature fruits are used. Under or over-ripe fruits should be discarded. Handling of fruits depends upon the kinds of fruit and the type of produce required. In general, the following steps are involved.

1.  Removal of unwanted fruits and parts (under ripe and over ripe fruits, stems, stalks, calyces, strings, leaves, foreign matter and mouldy, blemished and defecitive fruits).
2.  Washing and Preparation which may involve quartering, snubbing, cutting, mincing, destining, precooking, sieving, etc.

### Precooking and pulping:

Prepared fruits (e.g. cut pieces of pineapple, guava) are boiled with a little amount of water to a soft consistency. The fruit is macerated with a ladle and in case of guava, seeds are separated by passing through a sieve. Fruit pulp can be prepared by a household mixer cum grinder after blanching the fruits for 2-3 minutes.

### Jam boiling:

Fruit pulp, water, pectin (1%), sugar (67.5%) and acidity (0..5%) are boiled to ensure sugar penetration into fruit particles. Partial inversion of sucrose to dextrose and laevulose, destruction of enzyme and yeasts and other physical and chemical changes required to set the jelly fibre and to give the product its recognized characteristics. Excess quantity of water can be removed by

evaporation.

A short boiling time is important to preserve the colour and natural flavour. Artificial colour can be added with artificial flavour at the last stage of the boiling,. Acid (citric acid or lemon juice) should be added at the last stage of jelly fibre formation in liquid form.

### End point:

In open-pan boiling, the temperature is measured with a thermometer and the end point is usually at 105-1080C. A shallow metal spoon is also used to ascertain the end point. The spoon is dipped from time to time in the boiling pan and taken out and held in open for some time. When the syrup adhering to it forms flakes on cooling, it is presumed that the end point is near. Reading of 65 to 68 per cent total soluble solids (TSS) is also an indication of the end point of jam or jelly.

### Filling and filling temperature:

The prepared jam should be filled to containers (glass jars) previously cleaned and sterilized in boiling water and dried at 82-85°C. The filled jars are capped, the head space is sterilized near a flame and the packed containers are then air cooled.

### Recipe for jam preparation:

Generally, 45 parts by weight of fruit pulp requires 55 parts by weight of sugar and the substrate should be concentrated to 65 to 68 percent total soluble solid (TSS). Depending on the pectin content of fruit, external pectin should be added making the total pectin content about 1.0% Likewise, according to the PH of the fruit, the total pH level should be maintained at 3.2 by adding citric acid or lemon juice (a pinch). Optimum sugar concentration added should be 67.5 per cent which may vary slightly with the kind of fruit, their sweetness or internal sugar concentration, or acidity levels. Flavouring and colouring agents may be added according to necessity.

# PREPARATION OF FRUIT JUICES AND SQUASHES

Fruit juice is a natural juice pressed out of a fruit which remains almost unaltered in its composition during its preparation and preservations. The procedure for the extraction of juice varies according to fruit. In industry, various kinds of machinaries like screw press, hydraulic press, basket press, fruit pulper, roller presses, belt presses and centrifugal machines are used. When the fruit contains seeds, it should be separated by cutting and slicingthe fruit (Mango, Sapota, Plums, Jackfruit) and small seeded fruit like tomato requires special pressing cum seed separation device (Tomato processing maching). However, citrus fruit which contain bitter principle requires a particular approach where juice are normally extracted in special equipments in order to prevent the extraction of bitter components from their peel and consequent mixing into the juice obtained from their interior pulp. Thus, crushing and pressing are not employed in case of citrus fruits. Generally, citrus fruits are cut into halves and the juice is extracted by holding the cut halves against a revolving rose of burr (reamer) which is conical in shape and ribbed, and is made of stainless steel monel, aluminium or nickel. The reamer tears the juice cells of the fruit.

For the extraction of juice in home scale level or home made commercial juices, the fruit can be pulped in a mixer cum grinder after peeling, cutting and removing the seeds. The pulp can be pressed with folded muslin cloth by application of pressure. For higher yield of juice in some fruits like banana jackfruit, green mango; ou-tenga, etc. the pulp should be briefly boiled and pressed. Application of a small quantity of citric acid and fungal enzymes helps in the higher recovery of juice from the fruits. For extraction of citrus juice, small glass reamers of aluminium and nickel are available with a minimal cost.

The extracted juice should be filtered with a filter press or ordinary thick type muslin cloth. Some juices which do not settle satisfactorily during storage and are difficult to filter can be clarified by the addition of fining agents. A fining agent is a kind of coagulating agent which settles and carries with in the finely divided particles responsible for the cloudy appearance. The fining materials most commonly used for fruit juices are egg albumen, casein, bentonite clay and infusorial earth, etc.

### Preservation:

After extraction and filtration of the juice, it should be processed for preservation. To retain the natural taste and aroma of a juice, it is necessary to preserve it immediately after extraction. Various methods of preservation are employed with their own merit. The methods generally used are:

1.  Pasteurization: It is done in fruit juices to kill all microorganisms capable of growing in the juice and causing spoilage. It does not kill the thermophillic

bacteria which cannot grow in the acid fruit juices. Heavily carbonated juices can be pasteurized safely at 560C for 20 minutes. Most uncarbonated juices must be pasteurized at 800C for 15 to 20 minutes. Juices of high acidity may be pasteurized at a lower temperature of 70-720C for 20 minutes.

1.  Addition of preservatives : It is usually necessary to add preservatives to fruit juices except for canned juices which are consumed immediately after opening the can. The use of preservatives is essential in concentrated drinks or squashes which after opening the bottle are consumed over a period of several weeks. Two important fruit juice preservatives are : (a) Benzoic acid (benzoates) and (b) Sulphur dioxide (sulphites).

**Sodium benzoate**: The quantity required would depend upon the extent and type of infection to be overcome and the nature of juice, particularly the acidity. For juice of pH3.5 to 4.0, which is the range of most fruit juices, 0.06 to 0.10 percent should be added in a solution. In less acid juices like ripe grapes, banana, jackfruit, sapota, etc. at least 0.3% is necessary.

**Potassium metabisulphite**: It is used as a source of SO2. Fruit juices can be preserved for more than a year by the addition of 0.1 percent metabisulphite provided the juice is made from a sound fruit and stored in clean containers at a temperature not above 15oC. For preserving raw citrus juice for a few months for the manufacture of squashes in the off season, generally 700 ppm of SO2 is added for its strong effect in retarding oxidation preventing discolouration and loss of flavour of products. It should not be used in case of naturally coloured juices on account of its bleaching action. It also cannot be used in case of Juice which are stored in tin containers.

Chemical preservatives should never be added in solid form to fruit juices and squashes. They should first be dissolved in a small amount of juice or water and then in corporated.

### Preservation by freezing:

When stored at 0oC, the temperature ordinarily used in cold storage the fruit juices either become moldy or undergo fermentation. In order to prevent the growth of microorganisms, it is necessary to store them at temperatures below-40oC. Grape, apple and pineapple juices can be held for at least 2 years at temperatures of about 5o to 8oC without noticeable loss of flavour, aroma or colour when the juices are stored in sealed containers such as lacquered tins or bottles. A juice can be kept in good conditions for a long time at 1o F to 10oF in frozen form while avoiding contact with air. The juice is defrosted before consumption.

### Preservation by sugar:

All fruit juices may be preserved by the addition of sugar or by increasing the natural sugar content of the juice by concentration. Fruit juices containing

66 per cent or more sugar do not ordinarily ferment. Sugar acts as a preservative by osmosis and not as a true poison for microorganisms.

### Preparation of pineapple juice

For pineapple juice, varieties Kew and Giant, Kew are employed in the industry. For home preparation, any variety can be considered. Fully ripe fruits are selected, peeled and cut into pieces. The cut pieces should be homogenized or pulped with a mixer cum grinder and the juice is pressed out with folded muslin cloth. Basket press may be used, screw presses are also available at lower price.

### Processing of pineapple juice

Processing of pineapple juice (pH 3.5 to 4.0) in glass bottles, 30 minutes heating at 85oC is adequate to provide complete safety against yeast and mould spoilage and other mesophollic spoilage organism. In aluminium foiled pouches heating 25 min. at 85oC is adequate.

Juices from fruits can also be prepared in the same way with a light variation in preparation of the fruit and the mode of extraction of juice.

### Preparation of squash

Squashes are sweetened fruit juices containing some pulp. Fruit squashes contain a minimum of 25 percent by volume of fruit juice and are intended to be drunk after dilution. Squashes also invariably contain added flavour.

It has got excellent organoleptic quality in respect to test, colour, flavour, texture and eating quality and can be used as baby food.

### Preservation and processing of banana.

*   *   1.  Banana fruits of cultivar Kachkol, Manohor, Chenichampa can successfully be dehydrated for preparation of commercial chips using simple dehydrator.

### Method of preparation:

Mature green banana fruits at ¾ full finger were cleaned, peeled, sliced to a thickness of 3mm by a slicer and blanched for 2 min. in boiling water (1% NaCI and 0.17 KMS were added to blanching water) and dehydrated at 65oC for 7 hours to a final moisture content of 5 to 6 percent.

Kachkol variety was found to be the best in regards of chip quality, colour and nutrient retention points.

*   *   1.  A weaning food can be prepared from Bhimkol using filler material tapioca starch and enrichment of protein by adding green gram powder. Sixty percent banana powder was mixed 40% green gram powder. The formulation developed contains highest protein (14.14%), energy (371.12 K cal) with lowest carbohydrate (76,3%) and fibre content (1.35%). It contains all 18 essential amino acids. It has protein efficiency ratio (3.03) and food effectively ratio x FER) of 0.30.

Organoleptically, colour, flavour, teste and general acceptability was found to be excellent.

It can be stored upto 120 days in metal tin or alluminium foiled pouch at room temperature with maximum retention of nutritional quality.

**5\. Preparation of carambola chutney:** The pineapple of preservation of fruits and vegetables in the form of chutney is similar to that involved in the making of pickles and involves the use of sugar, salt, spice or vinegar as preservatives. The method of preparation usually includes a cooking process to hasten the action of the preservatives and develops an agreeable flavour and pleasing odour. Unlike pickle which take several days or weeks for seasoning, chutneys can be used for table purpose soon after preparation.

### Ingredients :

| Fruit pieces | - 1 kg. |
| --- | --- |
| Sugar | - 800 g. |
| Salt | - 50 g. |
| Ginger | - 50 g. |
| Onion | - 60 g. |
| Garlic | - 15 g. |
| Chilli powder | - 20 g. |
| Coriander powder | - 15 g. |
| Cardamom, Cina mon | - 5 g. |
| Cumin powder | - 25 g. |
| Vinegar | - 180 ml. |

**Preparation :** The fruit should be cut into small pieces and cooked in a pan with salt and sugar. After proper dissolving of salt and sugar, the pan should be removed from heat and cooled for 30 min. The mixture should then be recooked till it becomes thick and sticky. Grinded spices should be put inside the spice bag and allowed to boil along with fruit pieces. Finally, 2-3 fine thread formation by chutney when stretched between the index finger and thumb will indicate the end point. The spice bag should be removed and vinegar added. The chutney should be allowed to be cooled and then be put into open mouthed sterilized bottles and sealed properly.

This excellent chutney can be stored at least for 6 months at room temperature without much deterioration in nutritional and organoleptic quality.

# PREPARATION OF JELLY

Preparation of jelly is similar to that of jam, except for the use of juice instead of fruit pulp. It is prepared by boiling the fruit with water, expressing the juice and concentrating it to such a consistency that gelatinization takes place on cooling. A perfect jelly is clear, sparkling, transparent and of attractive colour. When removed from the glass, it should retain its form and should quiver, not flow.

The raw materials used for jelly making are similar to those used for jam. Pectin, sugar and acid in the mentioned quantity for jam are important ingredients for jelly making. Pectin and acid are added to those fruit juices which are deficient in these ingredients. The fruit rich in pectin and acid are the acid varieties of Apples, Lemon, Logan berries, Limes, Grape fruits, Sour Oranges, Damson plums and other Sour plums. Ripe melon, Carrots, Unripe bananas, etc. are low in acid but rich in pectin. Apricots and Strawberries etc. are rich in acid but low in pectin.

### Procedure

The fruits are first washed. Since, jellies are made from juice, ordinarily peeling is not required for fruit like guavas and apples. In case of orange and lemons, the yellow portion of the peel should be removed to get jellies free from excessive bitterness. Fruits are cut into slices so that pectin and acid may be extracted easily. Only a minimum quantity of water should be added to the fruit for a simple extraction of pectin. If necessary, a second or even a third extraction may also be taken and mixed with the first extract. If large quantities of water are used, the jelly will be weak and if too little water is used, the extract will be difficult to clarify. The length of boiling will very according to the variety and the texture of the fruit. The fruit should be heated only long enough to soften sufficiently to permit thorough extraction of juice by pressing and to render it mushy.

The juice extracted, filtered and boiled with sugar (67.5 percent optimum, which may vary according to fruit and its sweetness or sordidness), pectin (0.1 percent) and acid (pH 3.2). Colour, acid and pectin are incorporated just before the end point. Prolonged boiling results in loss of flavour, injury to colour and hydrolysis of pectin, consequently, it is a frequent cause of jelly failure.

The boiling is continued until on cooling the product forms a jelly of the desired consistency. The end point is determined by allowing the liquid to form sheet on a wooden ladle or spoon in sheets, or forms jelly like sheets on its side, the boiling is considered to be completed. If the juice contains the proportions of sugar, acid and pectin, the boiling point of the liquid at the jellying point will normally be about 110oC.

### Packing:

Jelly is usually packed at the boiling point or at about 95oC and sealed hot. Sterilization of jars and lid and hermetical sealing can keep the product free from mould or fermentation.

# PREPARATION OF PICKLES

There are several kinds of pickles which can be prepared. They are sour, sweet, special and mustard pickles. Picking is done in two stage, viz., (a) Curing or fermentation (which can be done with dry salting, fermentation in brine, or salting without fermentation) and (b) finishing and packing.

### Oil pickles:

In India, oil pickles which contain some edible oil particularly rapeseed or mustard oil are highly popular. Cauliflower, lime and mango pickles are of high demand.

### Cauliflower pickle:

Outer leaves and central stalks of cauliflower are removed. The cauliflower is then cut into pieces, washed, drained and placed in sun for 2-3 hours to remove some moisture. All the following spices except mustard are taken and ground into fine powder. These are fried in oil. When they turn brown, cauliflower pieces are also added and mixed thoroughly. When the pieces become soft, they are allowed to cool. Ground or broken mustard is then added and mixed. The mixture is placed in the sun for 5-7 days. Then 2.2 kg of vinegar is added and the mixture is again placed in the sun for 3 more days.

### Recipe:

| IngredientsPrepared cauliflower | Amount18.0 kg. |
| --- | --- |
| Salt | 1.125 kg. |

| Rape or Mustard seed oil | 2.250 kg. |
| Onion (chopped) | 560 g |
| Green ginger | 560 g |
| Cumin, cloves and Cinnamon (Equal quantities) | 168 |

For a sweet pickle 4.5 kg, of sugar should be added along with vinegar. Sugar may be replaced with equal quantity of gur (molasses). The pickle is put in a jar and covered with oil. It will be ready in about weeks time.

### Mango pickle:

Unripe, fully developed, tarty variety mangoes should be taken. Slice them longitudinally and varically with a knife, Discard the stones. Keep the slices in 2- 3 percent brine and blanch to prevent blackening. Mix the mango slices with the salt of the following recipe. Place the mixturd in a glazed jar and keep it in sum for 4-5 days still the slices turn pale yellow. Mix with other ingredients and smear with a little mustard oil. Then pack the pickle in glass of glazed jars and cover with a thin layer of mustard oil. The pickle will be ready in 2-3 weeks.

### Recipe

| Ingredient | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Mango slices | 10.0 kg. |
| Slat, powdered | 2.5 kg |
| Turmeric powder | 300 g |
| Red chilli powder | 300 g |
| Black pepper | 250 g |
| Mustard oil | 1.5 lit |
| Pasfuran | 250 g |
| Zira | 250 g |
| White mustard seedsLime pickle: | 300 g |

Fully ripe limes are washed thoroughly and given 2 to 4 slits each. Salt of good quality (1/4th the quantity of limes) and 3/4th of the limes are squeezed to release as much juice as possible into the jar. The juice should cover the contents of the jar. If necessary, a few more limes may be resqueezed and their juice poured into the jar. The jars are placed in the sun for a week. When the limes get softened and their skins turn light brown, the curing is completed. For preparing lime and green chilli pickle, these may be taken in proportions ranging from8:1 to 4:1 in weight. The rest of the process in similar to that of lime pickle.

### Preparation of carambola jelly Ingredients:

Carambola juice 1 litre

Citric acid 5 g

Pectin 5 g

Sugar 500 g

KMS 0.5 g/kg jelly.

### Preparation:

Matured just ripe carambola fruits are cut into small pieces. Citric acid is added and cooked with little quantity of water for half an hour just to soften the fruit pieces. The fruit juice extract is strained through a muslin bag kept for 6-7 hours in a hanging position. Juice is kept for setting and supernatant juice is tested for pectin. As carambola has lower pectin content, so pectin is added at the rate of 5g per litre of the juice. Sugar is added to the juice and put to heat. The fruit juice along with sugar, pectin is boiled briskly and steadily. The end point of boiling is determined by following the drop test in which a drop of concentrated mass is poured into a glass of water. Settling down of the drop without disintegration denotes the end point. The foam gathered on the top of the jelly should be discarded with the help of a ladle. Then the jelly is poured into sterilized open mouthed bottle and kept for 3-4 hours undisturbed. The bottle are sealed with wax and stored.

### Carambola pickle Ingredients:

| Carambola | 1 kg |
| --- | --- |
| Salt | 250 g |
| Turmeric powder | 30 g |
| Fenugreek | 25 g |
| Coriander powder | 30 g |
| White mustard | 50 g |
| Cumin powder | 10 g |
| Acetic acid | 5 ml |
| Oil (mustard)Preparation: | 500 ml. |

Mutured unripe carambola fruits are thoroughly washsed and cut length wise. Then they are made into smaller pieces. Turmeric powder is mixed with the fruit pieces. The carambola pieces are then placed over banana leaves and sun dried for 2-3 days. The mustard oil is heated and cooled and rest of the spices mixture is added to it. Then the sun dried carambola pieces are put into above mixture and the whole mass is thoroughly mixed. The pickles are then packed in polyethylene bags or glass bottles and stored at room temperature.

# POST HARVEST HANDLING OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

### Fruits

*   1.  Banana cv. Jahaji, Chenichampa and Monohar can be ripened successfully in 46-49 hrs. by applying 1500 ppm of ethrel at room temperature in gas chamber which give improved eating quality, development of attractive colour and pleasant flavour. However, at higher temperature, no development to pale yellow colour can be obtained in case of cv. Jahaji.
    2.  For post harvest storage of pineapple fruits, saw dust storage system should be used to increase shelf life of the fruits by 9 days. Fruit rotting can be controlled by this system significantly. Storing the fruits in polyethylene bags reduces the loss of fruits weight. Application of 6% wax emulsion can increase the self-life of Kew pineapple upto 21 days with minimum weight loss and retention of optimum freshness.
    3.  Both the perforated and non-perforated polyethylene bags, transparent or non transparent, can be used for packaging Assam lemon fruits to prolong storage life.
    4.  The Assam lemon fruits should be harvested when the fruits are 120 days old, the skin of the fruits becomes soft and the change of colour of the fruits from dark green to light yellow.
    5.  Khasi mandarin fruits should be packed in Corrugated Fiber Boxes (CFB) of 420mm x 300mm x 329mm size (with CFB partitions inside) having 18 numbers of 3 cm (diameter) circular holes (equally distributed on all sides). The shelf life of the fruits can be increased by 12-15 days. The cost per box is Rs 55-60.
    6.  Two pre harvest sprays during August and September with Carbendazim (0.1%) and _Trichoderma viridi_ @ concentration of 1 x 107 cfu (Colony Forming Unit) can maintain the quality of Khasi mandarin fruits like TSS, Sugar content and Ascorbic acid. and increased the shelf life of the fruits upto 15 days.
    7.  For increasing the shelf life of banana fruits, cut ends of the fruits after harvest should be dipped in Carbendazim 0.1%.
    8.  Improved Corrugated Fiber Boxes (CFB) of 685cm length, 380 cm wide and 258cm height can be used for long distant transportation of pineapple fruits. Cost of the boxes is Rs.70.00 per box. The cost per box is Rs 65-70
    9.  Fruits and vegetables can be stored in a low cost cooling structure. The structure should be prepared in an open area with facility of water supply. The length should be 1.5 – 1.6m, 1.0 – 1.2m wide and 0.6 – 0.7m height. Half of the total height should be under the soil and rest half above the ground. The floor and side walls (2 layered) of the structure should be prepared with bricks. The gap between the two layers should be 0.75cm and it should be filled up with sand. The sand should always remain wet. Arrangement should be made to cover the structure.

### Tomato:

10\. Mature tomato can be stored successful by applying 9% wax emulsion +2 ppm 2,4-D + O. 2% Captan up to 24 days in marketable condition at room temperature. It controls physiological loss in weight, fruit rot and retains maximum organoleptic qualities such as colour, texture and flavour. It retains a fairly amount of ascorbic acid also.

### Leafy vegetables:

Shelf-life of leafy vegetables like spinach coriander, lettuce and laisak can be extended up to 2 days in perforated transparent polyethylene bag (200 gauge), under room temperature and for 6-9 days under refrigerated condition (4±1°C) with maximum retention of ascorbic acid, colour and freshness of the vegetables.

### Colocasia:

Storage in perforated (0-3%) polyethylene (300 gauage) bag can prolong the storage life of colocasia with marketable quality up to 75 days for Ahina Kachu, 60 days for Kaka Kachu and 45 days for Neel Kachu.

### Cabbage:

Matured Cabbage (Hybrid) may be stored under cold storage condition (Temperature 50C to 70C) bagging under Gunny bag upto 50 days.

1.  **Storage of Betel vine**: Harvested leaves should be packed in fresh banana leaves in rolling fashion keeping both ends open.

**PLANTATION CROPS**

# BAMBOO

The bamboo is very important plant species and is put to varied uses like fodder, fuel wood in the villages besides its industrial importance.

### Soil and climate :

Bamboo can be cultivated on wide ranges of soils but well drained sandy loam to clay loam soils is most suitable. Hot and humid climate with even distribution of rainfall (2000 mm to 3000 mm) per annum) throughout the year is ideal for bamboo cultivation.

**Altitude:** Upto 3000m from sea level.

**Recommended species:** The species recommended for cultivation are : Bhaluka (_Bambusa balcooa_), Jati (_Bambusa tulda_), Kako (_Dendrocalamus hamiltonii_), Kotoha (_Bambusa bamboos_), Muli (_Melocanns bambusoides_).and Mokal (_Bambusa nutana_).

**Medhod of Propagation:** Seeds, offshoots, culm cutting, branch cutting, layering and marcotting.

### Propagation from seeds:

Seeds are collected from fruiting branches by shaking the culms, in a sheet on four bamboo poles put under the tree. The ripe seeds are mixed with Mancozeb WP 75 (2gm/kg of seeds) and dried before sowing. In no case seeds should be collected from the ground as it is certainly be infected by insects and fungi.

Seeds should be sown immediately after harvesting. Sowing time varied with the time varies with the time of seed seeting in different species.

**Seed Nursery**: Seeds should be sown into well hoed moist beds on rich soils. Spacings given are 30 cm x 10 cm. Shade of 1-1.5 m high may be provided to provide shade for the nursery. Beds should be 1 m wide and convenient length and 10 cm raised from the ground.

**Transplantation:** Seeds germinate 2 to 6 weeks after sowing, Transplantation is normally varies according to species but generally done between 12-18 months after sowing the seeds. Normally for ‘Muli’ and ‘Kako’ spacing is around 5-6 m and for other is around 6 to 8 m.

**Manuring:** After transplanting, a liberal application of manure/FYM should be made. In subsequent years 100g urea, 25g SSP and 25g MOP should be applied in a ring around each plant. Such treatments increases the number of tillers/ culms and also height of the tillers.

### Propagation from offshoots:

**Age of the planting material :**

The stem which 1 – 11/2 years old, bear brown sheaths on the lower nodes indicate the offshoot is selected. Offshoot should be selected from the outer ring and cut 2.5-3m from the ground just above a node. Soils should be removed from the main root and rhizome should be cut away from the parent stalk leaving as much as root as possible with the offshoot.

**Time of planting:** April to August.

**Spacing:** Pits should be dug of 60cm x 60cm x 60cm dimension at a distance of 5-8m depending upon the species.

**Method of planting:** The off shoots should be planted immediately in the pits. The roots should be buried so that one node of the stem is just below the ground. To avoid drying of the stem, the top is covered with a cake of cattle manure. The stem should be point at an angle of 40o to the ground.

**Manuring:** After planting the offshoots, equal amount of soil and FYM should be mixed to fill up the pits. In the first year of planting 300mg urea, 150g SSP and 50g of MOP should be applied per plant. In subsequent years the application of fertilizer should be increased proportionately.

### Propagation from culm cuttings:

**Selection of culm:** Two internodal cutting of varying length having 10-15cm culm length on either side can be used.

**Age of the culm**: 1 – 1½ years old.

**Preparation of the culm for treatment:** 1-2 years old culms should be collected and cut into two nodal segments. Lateral shoots should be trimmed. Care should be taken not to injure the nodal segments while trimming. Using a sharp knife/ chisel a small rectangular or round hole can be made in the internodal region of each cuttings.

**Use of Chemicals:** Boric acid 200g/liter of water. Best results can be obtained by adding 20mg/liter of water of IAA to the above chemical.

**Preparation of chemical**: All the chemicals are prepared by dissolving the appropriate quantity of chemicals in distilled or deionised water. IAA should be dissolved initially in a small amount of ethanol.

**Procedure for treatment:** The hollow internodal cavity should be filled with 100 to 150ml of the chemical solution preferably with the help of an injection syringe. The amount of chemical varies depending upon the size of the culm cuttings. Sufficient amount of chemical should be applied so that the two sides or nodes are touched by the chemicals. The holes should be sealed with cellophane tape.

**Time of chemical treatment of nursery plantation:** April to September.

**Plantation of the treated culms in nursery bed:** The treated cuttings should then be planted horizontally in the nursery bed so that sealed hole should face

upward. Spacing between cuttings should be around 25cm. Cuttings should be covered with soil 5-6cm deep. The nursery bed should be mulched with straw till the cuttings are sprouted. It there is no rain, watering should be done regularly.

**Transplanting :** Generally after 21/2 – 3 months time sufficient rooting and sprouting occurs and then the sprouted cuttings should be transplanted into the main field. The two sprouted nodes are separated by cutting in the internodal region and planted separately.

**Preparation of nursery beds :** Nursery beds should be prepared by hoeing the soil thoroughly. Beds should be raised to 10cm above ground. The beds should be manured with cowdung and/or compost adequately. The bed size should be 5 m x 1.2 m.

**Propagation by branch cutting** : Applicable in thick walled bamboo species like Bholuka, Kako, and Kotoha. Select good culms of thick walled bamboos. Extract basal lateral branches with root primordial. Cut into 2-3 noded segments and dip in hormone solution. Plant in sand bed in mist chamber and seal the exposed cut ends. Transplant rooted sprouted branch segments in poly bags. Keep in shade and after 6 months will be ready for planting.

**Layering and Marcotting** : Select 1 year old culm. Prune the branches. Half burry under soil media. For Marcotting, place mixture of garden soil, lead MOULD AND rooting hormone at each node. Wrap with coconut fibre and polythene. Rooted nodes should be separated and new plants planted in the field.

Site should be selected considering the water and nutrient availability, easy accessibility. Soil should be sandy loam and well drained. Provision of shade is important for seed beds and sprouted seedlings.

**Cultural care:** Earthling up of rhizomes with top soil should be done during February – March every year. Ordinarily young culms are not cut while twisted one and remnants of dead portion are carefully removed. The culms are thinned every year. Protection against stray cattle, goats etc. should be made to the new suckers developed during the month of May-June of the year. For that fencing around the plant area should be given.

**Harvesting:** Culms should be harvested at 506 years age 1 feet above the ground.

### Plant protection:

**Rat:** Rat damages the shoots of bamboo while sprouting. To control, rats should be destroyed along with the nests.

**Weevils, white ants and termites:** Plants should be protected by spraying Aldrine 30 EC at 6-10 ml per liter.

**Fusariums wilt:** Controlled by spraying 2% carbendazim at regular intervals.

# AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS

Agroforestry is a multiple land use system and symbiosis of tree growing, crop production and livestock. Such systems provide livelihood security for rural people along with their basic needs of food, fuel, fodder, fiber and fertilizer. Agroforestry systems are practiced by two ways by integrating the farm crops with the forestry or by integrating forest trees in to farming system.

The different types of Agroforestry systems along with their components being practiced are:

1.  AGRISILVICULTURWE (Trees + Crops/trees + Trees)
2.  SILVIPASTORL SYSTEM (Trees + Pasture + Animals)
3.  AGRI-HORTICULTURAL SYSTEM (Crops + Fruit trees)
4.  HORTISILVIPASTORAL SYSTEM (Fruit trees + Trees + Pasture + Animals)
5.  AGRI-HORTI-SILVICULTURE (Crops + Fruit trees + Multipurpose trees)
6.  AGRISILVIPASTORAL SYSTEM (Crops + Trees + Pasture + Animals)
7.  HOMESTEAD AGROFORESTRY (Multiple combination of various components)
8.  AGRI-PISCI-SILVICULTURAL SYSTEM (Crops + Fish + Trees)
9.  SILVI-APICULTURE (trees + honeybees)
10.  PISCI-SILVICULTURE (Fish + Trees).

### Different components of agroforestry systems

1.  Tree species Subabul (_Leucaena leucocephala),_ Bamboo (_Dendrocalamus strictus),_ Siris (_Albizia lebbek)_, Neem (_Melia azedarach)_, Sissoo (_Dalbergia sissoo)_, Modar (_Erythrina spp._), Kanchan (_Bauhinia variegata)_, Khoir (_Acacia catechu_), Kadam (_Anthocephalus Cadamba_).
2.  Fruits and Vegetables: Anola (_Terminalia oficinalis_), Ber (_Zizyphus spp._), Citrus (_Citrus spp._), Mango (_Mangifera indica_), Guava (_Psidium guajava_), Jack fruit (_Artrocarpus heterophyllus_), Mulberry (_Morus alba_).
3.  Crops: Wheat, paddy, mustard, lentil, pea, soyabean, gram, ground nut, ginger, turmeric, chillies, tomato, coriander, methi, French bean, greengram.

### Management practices:

Trees and crop system may be modified up to extend to adjust better like pruning of trees, changes in sowing time of crop etc. Need proper management of irrigation and drainage. However layer of soil should not be hard and should have good water holding capacity. Preventive measures against the infestation of pests and diseases should be taken in advance.

**MEDICINAL PLANTS**

**Ashwagandha (**_Withiania somnifera_**)**

Ashwagandha is an alternative plant for medicinal uses. Its roots, leaves and seeds have some medicinal values. The plants have wide adaptability and grown up to an altitude of 1200 m from M.S.L.

**Land situation**: Well-drained upland having mild acidic to mild alkaline soil is most suited for cultivation. It thrives well in loamy or clay loam soil. A friable loam rich in humus is ideal.

**Field preparation**: The preparation of land should start with the onset of monsoon. The land should be ploughed 3-4 times followed by several times harrowing and laddering in order to bring the soil to better tilth. At the time of final land preparation, sufficient amount of cow dung or compost or FYM may apply in the soil.

**Manures and Fertilizers**: Depending upon the availability, well decomposed FYM or compost up to 20t/ ha may be applied either by broadcast over the beds or in the soil prior to sowing. No inorganic fertilizers are generally used for this crop.

**Sowing method**: Seeds are either broadcasted or sown in lines 50-60 cm apart.

**Sowing time**: June and July. Generally germination starts with the beginning of summer to mid monsoon season.

**Plant population**: The plant stand should be maintained at 30-40 plants per sq. meter i.e. 3 to 4 lakhs per ha. Transplanting of 25 to 35 days old seedlings may be done to maintain the optimum plant stand. If transplanting of seedlings in the well-prepared field is to be done, spacing between the lines and plant should be 50 to 60 cm.

**Weeding, thinning and interculture operation**: Weeding is done at the early stage of the crop depending on the weed infestation. To maintain the optimum population thinning should be done 25-35 days after sowing. A light howing and earthing-up may be done during the time of weeding after thinning operation.

**Harvesting and post harvesting operation**: At 150 to 180 days after sowing (in the month of December when sown in June-July), the crop is harvested.

At maturity, the leaves of the crop turn yellow and the fruits turn red. Leaf shading may also occur.

Crops are uprooted and the entire roots are to be separated by cutting at base or 1 to 2 cm above the ground. Fruits are also collected separately.

Ripe fruits are sun dried for several days and after drying seeds are preserved in polythene bags. Roots are beaten to clean from the soil particles and hairy roots. Cleaned roots are cut into 7-10 cm long pieces, sun dried and preserved in gunny bags.

**Medicinal uses**: It is medicinal in sexual and general weakness and rheumatism. Also used as diuretic. Root powder is used in ulcers and inflammations as well as antibiotic, more particularly antibacterial.

**Safed Musli (**_Chlorophytum borivilliam_**)**

It is an annual herb with sub-erect slightly yellowish lanceolate leaves and plant height is about 1.5 ft (45 cm). The root system is tuberous, which is the economic part of the plants. The tuber is of 0.9cmx8.0cm in size and number varies from 5-30 per plant and white in colour.

**Soil:** The crop needs high land having light to medium textured soil i.e. sandy loam to loam. Water logged soils are not suitable. During the rainy days drainage system should be maintained to drain out the excess rainwater from the field. The crop requires warm and humid climate. For better growth soil pH should be around neutral.

**Propagation and planting material:** The crop can be propagated by seeds and root-tubers with some portion of crown attached to each tuber. Root-tuber takes lesser crop duration in comparison to crop grown from the seeds. In general, previous year root-tubers are used for cultivation. The sprouted root- tubers with crowns are the best to use as planting material. Root tubers with crown disc having the weight of 15-20g may be used for commercial scale production.

**Land preparation:** It requires systematic land preparation. Deep ploughing followed by several times harrowing should be done to attain a good tilth. Sufficient amount of well decomposed FYM/compost should also be applied at the time of final land preparation.

After land preparation, raised beds of 90 cm to 200 cm width may be prepared and these may be done easily by making 15 cm deep furrows between the beds to drain out the excess rain water.

**Planting time**: Last week of May to June.

**Seed treatment**: Planting materials may be treated with Mancozeb WP 75 or Captaf @ 2.5 to 3 gm/kg of seed or root-tuber.

**Seed rate**: 1200 kg/ ha or 165 kg / bigha.

**Spacing**: 20-24 cm between plants.

30 cm between rows.

**Manures and fertilizers**: 10-t FYM/ha or sufficient quantity of well-decomposed (FYM or) cow dung should be applied at the time of final land preparation. Nitrogen fertilizer is to be applied in the form of urea @ 100 kg/ha in two equal splits at 15 and 30 days after planting. As a basal dose of DAP @ 120 kg/ha and MOP @ 100 kg/ha are to be broadcasted before final land preparation.

**Irrigation**: Crop is grown generally in rainfed condition. Sufficient soil moisture in the bed should be maintained throughout the growing period and till the harvesting of crops. Sprinkler irrigation system may be employed for better growth and results.

**Weeding**: Two to three times manual weeding is necessary to maximize tuber yield.

**Deflowering**: All the flowers should be removed from plants for healthy growth of the tubers, more particularly during the early growth phases.

**Harvesting**: The crop is ready for harvest in eight months after planting. Root tubers turn into brown or brownish-red from white. Harvesting of tubers may be delayed up to April, if tubers are used for planting materials. The small tubers with crown are stored for planting in the next season, while the biggest size tubers are processed for marketing.

**Yield**: The average yield of fresh Musli is 5-6 t/ ha or dry Musli 1.0 to 1.2 t/ ha.

### Post harvest management:

**Drying**: After uprooting the tubers, it should be spread in shade for about 4 to 7 days and then peeled to remove the skin.

**Processing**: Large tubers are washed and outer skin is peeled off with the help of knife and then dried for 2 to 3 days. The dried tubers (18 to 20 % of fresh weight) are stored in airtight poly bags.

**Grading**: The dried tubers/fingers are graded on the basis of colour and size.

**Medicinal uses**: It is a principal ingredient in Ayurveda, Unani and Allopathic medicine, as a vitalize and health tonic and as a curative for pre-natal and post- natal problems. It acts as a natural aphrodisiac, alternative to Viagra, restorative for immunity improvement and as a remedy for diabetes and arthritis, used against rheumatism and joint pains. It is also useful for brain development in children and to cure physical weakness.

Flower : Small, pink, in clusters arranged in racemes. Fruit : Capsular.

**Variety**: Indonesian variety is suitable for Assam.

**Soil**: Clay-loam to sandy-loam soil with good amount of humus and devoid of water stagnation. The ideal soil pH is 5.5 to 6.5.

**Climate**: Moderately warm and humid climate. The basic requirement is partial shade (30 to 40%) and frequent irrigation.

**Propagation**: Branch-tips with 3-4 nodes are good propagating organ.

**Nursery**: Bed size: 1m breadth and convenient length (with sand rich medium + sufficient amount of FYM or compost). Fresh cuttings are to be planted at 3-5 cm gap. Poly bags filled with well prepared sand medium with single cutting can also be used for nursery raising. Light irrigation should be given to keep the beds moist.

**Land preparation**: Land should be well ploughed and beds of 130 to 150 cm breadth and length of convenient size are to be prepared with 50 cm gap between the beds.

### Manure and Fertilizer:

*   Sufficient amount of FYM/compost/well rotten cowdung/poultry litter (10 to 15 t/ha) (1.5 to 2 t/bigha) are to be applied at the time of final land preparation.
*   Alternatively, Chemical fertilizers can be applied @ 100:50:60 kg/ha N, P2O5 and K2O (30 kg urea, 42 kg SSP and 13 kg MOP per bigha). SSP and MOP should be applied as basal dose, at least four days before planting and urea should be applied in four equal splits.

**Plantation**: \\

*   Planting time: March-April and October- November.
*   Planting material: Rooted cuttings
*   Spacing: 45 cm x 45 cm.

**Intercropping**: Tall shrubby crops like Arhar, Jatropha, Papaya etc. can be cultivated at a spacing of 1-2 m x 1-2 m. Patchouli can also be cultivated as intercrop in arecanut or ornato-tree plantation or homestead woodlands.

**Interculture**: Weeding at early growth stage and one light hoeing between the lines at 25-35 days after planting is very essential.

### Plant protection:

*   Against Mite: Ethion @ one tea spoon mixed with two litre of water to be sprayed.
*   Against Nematode: Crop should be harvested and rooted stems should be uprooted and burnt. Furadon/ Carbofuron @ 4.5 kg/bigha should be applied. Application of neem-cake or mustard-oil cake can also control nematodes.
*   Against Root rotting: Soil should be sprayed near the stem base with Carbendazim 50 WP @ 2g/ litre of water. (The disease may also occur if there is water stagnation.

In case of severe infections by pests and diseases (if any): The plants should be harvested for leaves immediately and the stems should be uprooted. Uprooted stems should be dried and burnt, and soil should be treated with appropriate medicine. Crop rotation is also a good solution as non-chemical management of these problems.

**Crop cycles:** Following crop cycle can be maintained:

*   March-April to July-September.
*   October-November to March-April.
*   One to two year crop stand (depending on crop health & situation).

### Harvesting:

*   Crop is ready for harvest 4-5 months after planting
*   In seasonal crop cycle: Plants are cut at base.
*   In annual or biennial crop cycle: Less than 50% leaves with young branches of each plant are cut in intermittent harvestings. The crop will be ready for second harvest within 30-45 days after the 1st harvest during summer season. Urea or vermicompost or FYM or well rotten cowdung should be top dressed after harvest.

**Drying**: Harvested leave are dried in shade for 1 to 2 weeks. Mature and thick stalks should be removed. Dried leaves are then packed in cotton or jute bags and hanged from the roof of the store house. Ageing of leaves in storage improves oil quality. Market fluctuation, if any, can also be avoided by storing the leaves. Bamboo hut can be constructed with few bamboo “chang” on walls. Leaves should be kept on the mats in thin layers for drying. Storage bags can be hanged from the roof of the house.

**Yield :** 5 to 7 q dry leaves per bigha (i.e. 37 to 52 q dry leaves / ha).

**B-C ratio:** 1st Year = 2: 1; 2nd Year= 3: 1.

# APICULTURE

Honeybees are essential for pollination of many cross-pollinated crops, and also for production of honey which generates income to the farmers. There are four major honeybee species _viz_., Rock bee (_Apis dorsata_), little bee (_Apis florae_), Indian bee (_Apis cerena_) and Western bee (_Apis mellifera_). Out of them, former two are wild and the latter two are domesticated species. Indian bee is a brownish black, locally available domesticated Asiatic species. The beekeeping practice of North-East India is mainly based on this species. This is indigenous to India with average honey yield of 12 kg per hive per annum and the foraging range is 0.8-1 km. Western bee is an exotic golden yellow species most widely and commercially reared in the world. This is larger in size than Indian bee having average honey yield of 35-40 kg per annum with the foraging range of 2 km. The species is successfully introduced in Northern India and effort is being made to introduce in Assam including North East India.

### Apiar site:

An apiary is a place where honeybee colonies are reared. Site with proper sunlight, air circulation and shade should be selected for apiary. Good apiary location is one with abundance of nectar and pollen producing plants. Commercial beekeepers generally migrate their colonies from one place to another for flora and produce more than one api crop of several types. Some of the important bee foraging crop-plants are rapeseed-mustard, niger, buckwheat, sunflower, safflower, sesamum, bottle gourd, pointed gourd, pumpkin, ridge gourd, sponge gourd, maize, soyabean, _jamun, litchi_, mango, drumstick, guava, citrus, coconut, areca nut, date palm, pummelo, ironwood, tamarind, mayflower, pomegranate etc..

### Beehive and other equipments:

Honeybees are reared in the modern beehive based on principle of bee space. Beehive is composed of brood chamber and honey chamber. The brood chamber is meant for rearing progeny and the super or honey chamber is used for secreting honey. The following beekeeping equipments are required for honeybee rearing.

1.  Beehive:
    1.  ISI A type 8 frame for Indian bee, ISI B type 10 frame for Indian bee.

### Rearing Season:

Seeds or colonies are normally available during spring i.e. February to March as this is a peak-breeding season of the honeybees. Colonies can be collected from the natural sources or may be procured from the beekeepers. Rearing can be started with three or four frame worker bee having one year mated queen. During winter (December to January) and in spring (February to March) are the best seasons to start beekeeping.

### Seasonal Management:

There are generally three seasons for bee management.

### Spring Management:

Beekeepers calendar starts with the activity of honeybee colonies after prolonged rain and winter cold. As this is a major flowering season, worker bees become busy for collecting nectar and pollen from flowers and thereby help in building the colonies. This is known as honey-flow season and in this season mostly extraction operation is done. However, there is a problem with swarming, which is acute in Indian species but less in western species. Swarm prevention can be done by frequent inspection of the colony, removing the queen cell, dividing the strong colony and helping the week one.

### Summer and Rainy season management:

In the summer management, honeybee colonies should be kept under shade just to protect from scorching sun. As there is continuous rainfall in Assam during the rainy season, honeybee colony should be provided with artificial diet, composed of carbohydrate, protein and water. Effective artificial diet comprises of sugar (as carbohydrate); black gram or green gram or soybean powder (as protein source) and water @ 1 kg of sugar and 100 gm protein powder mixed in 1 lit of water. It should be administered as per requirement of the colony.

### Winter management:

The honeybee colonies should be taken out from the shade and exposed to the sunlight.

### Migration of the colony:

During winter, honeybee colonies should be migrated to the oilseed crop fields (mainly rapeseed-mustard crop) and then to spring blooms of fruit, forage crops and forest plantations. In this practice both the beekeepers and farmers will be mutually benefited in terms of honey and crop production. Migration is essential for getting substantial yield of crops as well as honey.

### Disease and Enemy Management

Several diseases, _viz_., and fungal, bacterial, viral and protozoan diseases infect honeybees. Out of these, viral and protozoan diseases are most serious ones in Assam.

### Sac-brood disease:

This is a viral disease caused by Thai-sac strain. The symptoms of this disease are

1.  The larvae become pale; then turn brownish-black and gradually dry up.
2.  The punctured capping with dead pupa within the cell.
3.  The infection is usually in worker, seldom in drone and spread by drifting nurse bees.

### Control:

**Dequeening and Requeening:**

Creat broodlessness for some time by dequeening and requeening through production of new queen cell. Infected colony should be treated with antibiotics like Teramycin, 250 mg @ one tablet per 4 lit of sugar syrup.

### Nosema disease:

Nosema disease is found in adult Western bee colony. The infected bees show the symptom of crawling, disjointed wings and the mid-intestine becomes swollen with pale colour.

The treatment with hydroxy quinoline mixed with sugar @ 250 mg/4 litre of sugar syrup will give effective control. Against fungal disease, proper aeration and exposure to the sunlight prove to be effective.

### Natural Enemy:

Almost half a dozen natural enemies such as lizard, wasp, waxmoth, cockroach, birds, ants and mites infest honeybee colonies. Out of them, waxmoth and predatory wasp are most serious enemies.

**Waxmoth, _Galleria mellonella:_**

Waxmoth lays eggs on the stored combs or on the spare combs in the colony. Larvae develop by feeding on wax and pollen in comb cells. Wax moths are most active in summer and rainy seasons. To manage this pest; store combs by removing extra combs from the colony. Fumigate stored combs in air-tight space (in hive chambers, sealed between with mud or dung) and treated with acetic acid or formalin. But fumigation with sulphur smouldering in most effective. Removal and destruction of infected portion of the comb is also recommended. The biocontrol practice of treatment with _Bt_ formulation var. kurstaki @ 0.5 gm/ 100 ml. of water per hive gives effective control of the pest.

### Predatory wasp:

Among the wasps, the burrowing (_Vespa magnifica._) and aerial wasps (_Vespa cinta_) are two common species in Assam, which predate on honeybees. To protect the colonies from the wasp, practices such as destruction of wasp

nest in the vicinity of the apiary and artificial net covering (with nylon net of 1 cm mesh size) over the bee hive colonies are found to be effective.

For controlling bee mites, honey bee colonies should be exposed to the sunlight and in acute cases chlorbenzilate fumigation gives effective control. Sulphur dusting @ 200 mg/hive on top bars of frames is also effective.

**_Honey bees in crop production_**

Honey bees are essential for pollination of all the cross pollinated crops. It has been clearly demonstrated through experimentation at AICRP on Honeybee scheme AAU, Jorhat that honey bee colonies enhance crop yield to the tune of

1.5 to 2 times as shown below:

| Crop | Colony requirement | Yield (q/ha) | Per cent yield increase over open pollination |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mustard | 5 | 12.2 | 157.65 |
| Niger | 6 | 6.1 | 146.98 |
| Buckwheat | 5-6 | 14.2 | 152.68 |
| Litchi | 5-6 | 66.7 | 142.75 |
| Assam lemon | 4 | 50.80 | 57.14 |

Hence honeybee colonies are considered as essential input for increasing productivity of cross pollinated crops. Migration of honeybee colonies is necessary for both crop and honey yield.

### Pesticidal Poisoning to Honey Bees:

In order to protect the honeybees from pesticide poisoning eco-friendly pesticides, which are less toxic to honeybees should be recommended. Moreover, the application of pesticide on flowering crops should be done in the afternoon when the bee activity stops in the field. Some of the bee friendly pesticides with inorganic and organic compositions are oxydemeton methyl, endosulfan and deltamethrin and botanicals. Biopesticides such as _Bt._ formulation, NPV etc. which are having less or no residual toxicity should be incorporated in the Integrated Pest Management Packages.

### Recommendation of Bt. Formulation against Wax moth

Wax moth, _Galleria mellonella_ is one of the most serious pests of honeybee causing severe damage to the colonies. Various remedial measures such as cultural, chemical were adopted without having any full proof effect. In order to have effective management of this pest, biocontrol experiments with _Bt_. Formulation, var. kurstaki @ 0.5 per cent controlled the waxmoth effectively. Hence, _Bt_ var. kurstaki 0.5 gm/hive/litre of water has been recommended against wax moth.

# APPENDIX XI

## Some unconventional organic pesticidal preparations

### TOBACCO DECOCTION:

This can be effectively used against aphids and other similar soft bodied insect pests of vegetable crops. The decoction is prepared in the following way:

*   1.  Steeping 500 g of tobacco wastes in 4.5 litres of water for 24 hours.
    2.  Dissolving 120 g of sliced ordinary bar soap in another container and adding it to the decoction under violent agitation.

The final solution should be diluted 6-7 times before spraying.

### NEEM KERNEL SUSPENSION

This preparation acts as repellent againt locusts, grasshoppers and other chewing insects particularly belonging to Lepidoptera.The following are the steps to be followed for preparing this suspension.

*   1.  Kernels should be ground into a coarse powder form.
    2.  This suspension is effective only with a concentration of 0.1 to 0.3% (for preparing 0.1% suspension 1 g of powdered neem seeds required per litre of water).
    3.  The required quantity of neem powder should be put in a bag of muslin cloth and dipped in the corresponding volume of water contained in a bucket for about 12 hours.
    4.  Thereafter, the bag is to be squeezed repeatedly after dipping in the fluid until the out-flowing liquid turns light brownish.

The suspension is now ready for use.

### KEROSENE EMULSION:

This contact insecticide is very effective against a wide range of sucking insects. The procedure for its preparation is outlined below :

*   1.  500 g of ordinarily bar soap is to be sliced finely and dissolved in 4.5 liters of hot water.
    2.  The solution is to be allowed to cool down.
    3.  9 liter of kerosene should be added to it under violent agitation till the oil is fully emulsified. This stock solution should be sprayed after it is diluted 15-20 times.

### ASAFOETIDA – TURMERIC MIXTURE

This preparation can be used for controlling bacterial wilt of solanaceous vegetables like to tomato. This should be applied as soil drench for three times after 15,30 and 45 days of transplanting the vegetables. This mixture can be prepared in the following way:

*   1.  Both asafoetida and turmeric should be ground in to powdery forms.
    2.  1.5 g asafoetida and 5 g turmeric powders should be dissolved in a little amount of water.
    3.  Finally, the volume of the mixture is to be made up to 10 liters by pouring required quantity of water into it.
    4.  The mixture is now ready for soil drenching.

# APPENDIX XII

## Preparation of some common fungicides

### BORDEAUX MIXTURE (1%)

*   1.  Dissolve 100 g of powdered copper sulphate in 5 litters of water in a plastic bucket.
    2.  Prepare milk of lime in another plastic bucket by dissolving 100 g of quick lime in 5 litres of water.
    3.  Pour the copper sulphate solution and the milk of lime from the above two vessels into a third one by gently stirring the mixture all the while. This will give a final volume of 10 liters.
    4.  The mixture is to be tested before use for the presence of free copper which is toxic to the plant. Dip a polished knife in the mixture. If the blade shows a reddish colour add more lime to the mixture till the blade does not show staining on dipping.

### BORDEAUX PASTE :
