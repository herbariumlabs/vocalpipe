## **OVERVIEW	OF	SCHEME	FOR	PROMOTING	USAGE	OF AGROTEXTILES IN NORTH EAST REGION** {#overview-of-scheme-for-promoting-usage-of-agrotextiles-in-north-east-region}

1. ## **Introduction**	 {#introduction}

The North Eastern Region (NER) of India is composed of eight states: Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura. The region occupies about 5.6% of the total geographical area of the country. The varied climate, altitude, edaphic conditions, etc. lead to enriched biodiversity and formation of salubrious cultural and social environments in the region. NER can be further subdivided into three geographic regions: plain valley, medium hills and higher elevation, which house vast environment and social diversity.

A large number of horticultural crops are grown in the north eastern region; crops like banana, mango, and a large number of citrus and floral species are native to this region. NER contributed nearly 4% of the country’s horticulture production in 2010-11, and is collectively the leading producer of fruits, supplying nearly 12% of India’s litchis, 47% of pineapple, and nearly 7% of the country’s citrus fruits. NER is also a leading producer of vegetables, like cabbage, cauliflower, and sweet potato, in India. Among the states of the NER, in terms of fruit production and area, Assam occupies maximum followed by Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura. Similarly in vegetable production Assam has occupied maximum in production and covered area under the crop.

Given the prominence of agricultural activities in the North Eastern Region, and the significant contribution of this region to the national agriculture sector, this region will greatly benefit from the application of agrotextile technology. While agricultural activities are mostly dependent on natural conditions such as sunlight, water, climate (wind, hail, humidity), external factors (birds, weeds, insects, etc.) and post-harvest handling of produce, absence of control factors expose the region’s agricultural sector to risks of unsatisfactory yield, marred quality of produce, damages to the produce, regional limitation on cultivation, and seasonal limitation on cultivation.

Agrotextiles are used in farming, animal husbandry, sericulture and horticulture to control the hazardous influences of environmental and climactic factors on crop production and cattle breeding, regulate nutrient level intake of plants, silk worm rearing and assist in process and post-harvest operations. Agrotextiles have been demonstrated to be successful world over in not only protecting the crops from any external factors, but also in improving agricultural yield. Researchers in developed countries have proven the advantages of agrotextiles in improving per hectare productivity and quality of produce, specifically for horticulture and floriculture crops, through numerous studies and onsite trials.

Field trials and pilot studies have demonstrated the following benefits of usage of agrotextiles:

* Increased productivity (50-80%, depending upon the nature of crop)

* Premium quality of produce (increased income by 50-60%)

* All season and any region cultivation of crops

* Early and even ripening of produce (more harvest cycles per year)

* Reduced water consumption (10-15%)

* Minimised use of fertilizers and pesticides (25-30%)

* Prevention of damages owing to birds, insects, hail, sunburns, falling off of ripened fruits (100% protection)

* Weed control, etc.

As a result, the use of Agrotextiles is increasing daily on a global level, with farmers in industrial and developed countries using agrotech products to reduce sunburn damage to crops and evaporation of irrigation water, as well as, the menace from birds and pests. Presently, common Agrotextile products like mulch mats, shade nets, soil covers, and protective nets are being used all over the world.

While the cultivation of horticultural crops and floriculture crops can be further enhanced with use of protective Agrotextiles, their inclusion in the XIIth Five Year Plan is of vital importance to the national economy and agriculture sectors. Nonetheless, the north- eastern region in particular is yet to adopt this innovative technology on a larger scale. It is therefore worthwhile to promote Agrotextiles in India’s north-eastern states for introducing modern cost effective technology in the NER and also to boost the economy of the states in this region.

The aim is to utilize Agrotextiles in improving the horticulture and floricultural produce of the NER states. With increasing acceptability of Agrotextiles, entrepreneurship in the area of agrotextiles production in the country will get an impetus. The growth of usage of Agrotextile products in the country will thus benefit both agriculturists as well as textile entrepreneurs in the country.

In order to promote and increase the usage of Agrotextiles, in agriculture, horticulture/floriculture, sericulture and allied activities in the North Eastern Region, Ministry of Textiles has formulated a Scheme for Promotion of Usage of Agrotextiles in the North Eastern Region, with two components for a period of five years at a cost of Rs 55 crores.

2. ## **SCHEME COMPONENTS**	 {#scheme-components}

   The scheme components are as under:

   **Component I.	Creating awareness, setting–up of Demonstration Centres and developing capacities**

   **Component II.	Provide/disburse agrotextile kits in the NER states**

   1. ## **Component	I:	Creating	awareness,	setting–up	of**

   **Demonstration Centres and developing capacities**

      1. This Component will have two sub-components:

1. Creating awareness on usage of Agrotextile products in the North-East region of the country through a series of awareness programmes and media publicity.

2. Creating demonstration set-up for demonstrating the benefit of usage of Agrotextile products suitable for the region and building local capacities in collaboration with the agrotextile manufacturers and relevant State Agriculture bodies, Agriculture Universities, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK), NGOs, etc.

   2. The first sub-component will be addressed through following interventions:

1. Organizing	seminars/workshops	for	farmers	and	other	beneficiary stakeholders  
2. Publication of articles on advantages of usage of agrotextile products in local magazines, new publications focused towards agriculture  
3. Promotion of usage of Agrotextiles by participation in agricultural and allied exhibitions by Indian manufacturers and suppliers of agrotextile products  
4. Publicity via radio channels in local language

5. Publicity via television programmes focused on cultivators.

6. Any other activity related to the above objectives.

   3. The second sub-component is for creating demonstration set-up to demonstrate the benefit of usage of Agrotextile products suitable for the region, in collaboration with agrotextile manufacturers and relevant State Agriculture bodies/universities, Krishi Vigyan Kendras(KVK), NGOs, etc with technical support from the COE. The demonstration centers will be established to demonstrate the individual application of agrotextile products with different combinations as per the requirement and produce of the region. Such demo centers may consist of the following indicative list of agrotextile products:

1. Shade net house

2. Ground Cover

3. Hail protection nets

4. Bird protection house

5. Vermicompost bed

6. Fencing nets

7. Wind-breaking nets

8. Low tunnel for crop protection

   4. This sub-component-II will comprise of the following activities:

1. Identification of State Agriculture/sericulture bodies/universities, KVKs, NGOs, etc. with expertise in protective cultivation in the region by the concerned State Govt.s that would provide land and premises for creating demonstration centers: State Agriculture bodies, KVKs, NGOs, etc.

2. Identification of suppliers of	relevant agrotextile products and installation

   thereof: The manufacturers of relevant agrotextile products with the capacity to install and maintain the demonstration centers will be eligible for establishing demonstration centers. They will empanelled by Centre of Excellence for Agrotextiles, SASMIRA, COE Agrotech through an open- tender process based on certain criteria to be defined in the corresponding Request for Proposal;

3. The demo centre shall be jointly run by the of State Agriculture bodies/universities, KVKs, NGOs who provide the land and the supplier/installer of the demo-centre. They will also be jointly responsible for capacity building programmes for the farmers and other stakeholders in the region.

4. Planning and layout for installation of the products: Technical design and layout of the demonstration centers would be provided by COE: Agrotech in consultation with agriculture experts, Agriculture Universities, KVKs, etc. to suit the regional and crop needs;

5. Installation of facilities at the demonstration center:  On the basis of the design, layout and specification provided by COE Agrotech, the supplier/installer shall carryout the installation of relevant agrotextile and associated material;

6. Monitoring the performance in terms of crop growth, quality of produce and yield parameters: State Agriculture bodies, KVKs, Agriculture Universities/COE Agrotech, etc. will monitor the performance and efficacy of the use of Agrotech products and submit reports/ data and other inputs, for evaluation of the scheme from time to time. MIS formats to be prepared by COE with agrotextile experts

   5. Apart from the above further interventions; developmental activities and R\&D efforts to be undertaken by COE Agrotech under the scheme are as follows:

1. Based on the demonstration trials, as at 2.1.3 above in these demonstration centres, the specifications of the products suitable for the NER would be developed to enable their manufacturing in the country and will be recommended to BIS and other standards-monitoring agencies, as necessary.

2. Apart from demonstration set-up, further extrapolation of suitability of Agrotextiles to other crops in the NER would be carried out based on laboratory simulation studies by COE Agrotech. Study on the performance of various types of Agrotextiles laboratory tests and simulation modeling for their influence on control of environmental factors like soil, temperature, heat and light and also the plant growth will be carried out.

3. After establishment of the improvement in the yield in qualitative and quantitative terms, COE Agrotech will perform the cost – benefit analysis of the agrotextile products to find economic viability of use of these products in agriculture, sericulture, horticulture and allied areas.

4. COE Agrotech would assist in preparation of the standard specification for the Agrotextile products to be used for the NER to be approved by appropriate authorities. The Centre of Excellence will also assist in development and certification of Agrotextile products.

5. Schemes for appropriate incentives to be worked out in consultation with State Agriculture Departments so as to popularize the usage of Agrotextiles in the NER.

6. Develop Capacities amongst the State Governments and other agencies like Krishi Vigyan Kendras and dissemination of project results to the end users and the stakeholders. Continued dissemination of information with awareness programmes as well as buyer-sellers meet would empower the region with protective cultivation practices. The farmers would be assisted through trainings/ workshops on proper cultivation practices on usage of Agrotextile products.

7. Facilitating backward-forward market linkages for demand and supply of agrotextile products to ensure availability, access and adequate consumption of agrotextile products in NER, while promoting the growth of entrepreneurs and support systems in this segment.
