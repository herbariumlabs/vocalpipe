# National Mission on Edible Oils – Oilseeds (NMEO-OS)

# Introduction:

Government of India has sanctioned a new mission namely ‘National Mission on Edible Oils- Oilseeds (NMEO-OS)’ as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) under Krishonnati Yojana (KY) of the Department of Agriculture & Farmer’s Welfare (DA&FW) from 2024-25 to 2030-31 subsuming the existing National Food Security Mission - Oilseed (NFSM-OS) with an outlay of ₹ 10103.38 Cr (Central share ₹ 7481.67 Cr). The Mission will support boosting production of oilseed crops with a primary focus on Rapeseed-Mustard, Groundnut and Soybean and making targeted interventions in other oilseed crops including secondary oilseeds and tree-borne oilseeds (TBOs). ‘Sub Mission on Minor Vegetable Oil’ will also form a part of the NMEO-OS Mission to improve oil extraction from secondary sources like cottonseed, rice-bran, and TBOs through targeted interventions.

# Objective:

The National Mission on Edible Oils – Oilseeds (NMEO-OS) is strategically designed to reduce India's reliance on imported edible oils, and drive towards _atmanirbharta_ by boosting domestic oilseed production and improving farmer incomes. This will be achieved through addressing the significant yield gap (~60%) in oilseed crops and targeting multiple key areas to ensure sustainable growth in the sector.

The mission aims to:

1.  **Harness innovations**: Utilizing already available and early-maturing innovations and technological breakthroughs for addressing the yield gap.
2.  **Accelerate dissemination**: Promoting the rapid dissemination of improved seed varieties (released in the last five years) and technologies within crop-specific clusters involving cooperatives, FPOs, and the private sector.
3.  **Targeting expansion**: Encouraging the expansion of oilseed cultivation in fallow areas specially in eastern states and promoting intercropping through demonstrations.
4.  **Increasing availability of improved seeds**: Addressing deficiencies in the seed production and distribution system to ensure availability and accessibility of quality seeds.
5.  **Enhance market access**: Linking oilseed farmers and value chain partners (VCPs) with processors to improve their market access and ensure better returns.
6.  **Support extraction and collection of secondary oilseeds**: Bolstering the production of secondary oilseeds and Tree Borne Oils (TBOs) through targeted interventions.

# Key Activities:

To achieve the above objectives, the Mission will undertake following key activities:

1.  Formation of **over 600-value chain clusters covering approximately 10 lakh hectares annually**, involving FPOs, Cooperatives, and private corporations as VCPs.
2.  Conducting Frontline Demonstration (FLD), Cluster Frontline Demonstration (**CFLD) and Block demonstrations** over an area of 2.8 lakh hectares annually including in fallow areas and to demonstrate intercropping.
3.  Establishment of **65 additional seed hubs** and **50 specialized storage units**, particularly for Groundnut and Soybean seeds to optimize seed infrastructure.
4.  **Preparing 5-year seed rolling plan and advance tie-ups with seed-producing agencies**

to ensure timely availability of improved seed varieties to farmers.

1.  Support to establish **post-harvest infrastructure** for processing of oilseeds and improving collection and extraction efficiency in secondary oilseeds and TBOs.
2.  **Targeted interventions in project mode** for addressing issues in secondary sources and TBOs.
3.  **Monitoring** mission activities **through digital technologies** to track progress.
4.  Implementation of a **robust Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaign** for public education on dietary guidelines and capacity building for stakeholders.

# Funding Pattern & Fund Flow

*   The NMEO-OS will be implemented in all States/UTs with the funding pattern of **60:40** in case of general States, Delhi & Puducherry and **90:10** in case of North-Eastern States and hill States, and **100%** funding for UTs and Central Agencies.
*   However, there are many components which are fully supported by GoI i.e. purchase of breeder seeds, CFLD/FLD etc. Component wise details of fund sharing, and assistance pattern has been provided at **Annexure 2**.
*   Since NMEO-OS is a part of the Umbrella Scheme of Krishonnati Yojana (KY), the funding pattern and fund flow will align to the KY and is subject to changes in line with modification of fund flow of KY. State/UT and District shall follow the relevant directions issued in this regard from time to time by GoI.

# Value Chain Clusters

# Cluster Formation:

*   *   1.  The cluster approach under NMEO-OS aims to accelerate the adoption of newly released crop varieties and recommended practices. States must ensure that the total area designated for clusters for each crop aligns with the cluster area targets assigned to the State/UT under the mission, as outlined in Annexure 3.
        2.  The minimum cluster size should be maintained as follows:
            *   **Major oilseed crops** (Soybean, Groundnut, Rapeseed-Mustard): 500 ha (250 ha for Northeast and hilly states).
            *   **Minor oilseed crops** (Sesame, Sunflower, Niger, Safflower): 200 ha (100 ha for Northeast and hilly states).
            *   **Exclusive clusters for FRA holders** : 100 ha for any major/minor oilseed. However, FRA patta holders can also be part of any other cluster.
        3.  Clusters must be entirely within the boundaries of a single district. Overlapping clusters across districts are not permitted. Similarly overlapping of clusters within the district should also not be there. Efforts should be made to keep the number of clusters to be minimum and farmers of one geographical area or administrative unit (block/tehsil /taluka) should be in one cluster only.
        4.  The overall area of all the clusters in the district should not be more than the ceiling prescribed by the SOSM.
        5.  A suggested list of districts for cluster formation is provided in Annexure 4. However, states may propose and establish clusters in other districts with prior approval from SOSM, ensuring state-specific cluster area targets are met.
        6.  Each crop cluster should include a minimum of 200 farmers (100 farmers in North-eastern and hilly states). While these farmers do not need to be in a contiguous area, they must reside within the same district. However, the same farmer should not get the assistance under a cluster for more than one year in one crop.
        7.  If a district lacks sufficient area for a single crop cluster, a multi-crop cluster can be formed. However:

1.  Multi-crop clusters should ONLY be created when forming a single crop cluster is not feasible.
2.  The total cluster size must still meet the minimum requirement of 500 ha (250 ha for Northeast and hilly regions).
    *   1.  Areas under intercropping of oilseeds should be included when calculating the total area for a cluster.
        2.  Each cluster will be managed by a Value Chain Partner (VCP), which can be a Farmer Producer Organization (FPO), Cooperative, or Public/Private Corporation operating in the oilseed sector.
        3.  The District Executive Committee (DEC) is responsible for identifying and selecting VCPs for these clusters within their respective districts, following the scheme guidelines. Priority should be given to farmers' collectives such as FPOs and Cooperatives. If no eligible FPO or Cooperative is available in a district, other public or private corporations may be appointed as VCPs, adhering to the procedures detailed in subsequent sections.

# Eligibility criteria for VCPs

*   *   1.  The DEC shall invite applications from eligible FPOs and Cooperatives and public/private corporations to form crop-specific clusters following the scheme guidelines.
        2.  The DEC shall finalize the application based on the eligibility criteria mentioned here by adopting a marking system based on defined parameters (details of the scoring parameters are mentioned in Annexure 5).
        3.  Oilseed farmers within the clusters shall be given priority under convergence schemes such as Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) and Per Drop More Crop (PDMC). Special emphasis will be placed for support under the National Beekeeping and Honey Mission.
        4.  Eligibility criteria For FPOs / Cooperatives: FPOs and Farmers' Cooperatives fulfilling the following criteria shall be eligible:

1.  Should be registered under the Companies Act or Cooperatives Act
2.  Should have an experience of at least 3 years working in the district where the cluster is formed
3.  At least 200 farmers (100 for Northeast and Hilly regions) should be registered in the FPO or Cooperative
4.  Average annual turnover in the past 3 years should be greater than Rs 9 lakhs

# Soil Health Testing

*   *   To enhance soil health and optimize fertilizer use while minimizing environmental impact, it is crucial to assess the fertility and nutrient status of the soil regularly. This evaluation provides valuable insights into the soil's nutrient availability, helping farmers make informed decisions on fertilizer application, thus promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
    *   Soil testing is an essential tool in this process, enabling the creation of a Soil Health Card for each farmer. The Soil Health Card serves as a personalized guide, offering a comprehensive analysis of the nutrient profile of the soil and providing recommendations for nutrient management. By identifying the exact requirements of the soil, farmers can apply fertilizers in precise, targeted doses, avoiding excess or insufficient usage, which leads to cost savings and improved crop productivity.
    *   To ensure widespread adoption of soil testing and its benefits, it has been made mandatory for all farmers registered in the clusters. This will be tracked through integration of Soil Health Portal with the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oilseeds (NMEO-OS) portal for seamless data exchange. This integrated approach will create a more efficient and standardized system for soil health management across the country.
    *   Support for soil testing is provided at a subsidized rate of ₹110 per Soil Health Card. This support is a crucial step in making soil testing accessible to farmers, particularly those in rural or underserved areas, who might otherwise face financial barriers to testing. By ensuring that soil testing is both affordable and mandatory, the initiative aims to promote long-term soil health improvement, increase fertilizer use efficiency, and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices that benefit both farmers and the environment.

# Digital Monitoring of the Mission

*   *   Under this Mission, a comprehensive data tracking and monitoring system will be implemented using Krishi Mapper, a digital platform developed by the DA&FW. This system will ensure the accurate and real-time tracking of all activities related to the mission, enabling better decision-making and more effective implementation at the grassroots level.
    *   To facilitate seamless data collection and ensure broad participation, Self-Help Groups (SHGs) will play a pivotal role. These groups, particularly Krishi Sakhis (women community leaders), will be engaged to collect and update vital data on the Krishi Mapper platform. Their local presence and knowledge of the farming community make them ideal for this task, enabling efficient data entry and continuous monitoring. Their involvement also supports empowerment and capacity-building within rural communities, enhancing the sustainability of the initiative.
    *   In addition to SHGs, VCPs are tasked with registering participating farmers in advance. This process will be done through digital platforms such as Krishi Mapper, which will facilitate streamlined data collection, ensuring that all farmers are accurately registered and tracked throughout the program. This digital integration enhances transparency and accountability, making the monitoring process more efficient and effective.
    *   To ensure the effective implementation of this data collection system, support is provided at a rate of ₹30 per farm per season. This financial assistance is specifically for the hiring of Krishi Sakhis to update and maintain data on Krishi Mapper. This subsidy will help incentivize and compensate SHGs for their work, ensuring their sustained involvement in the scheme. By providing this support, the Mission ensures that the data collection process is robust, consistent, and efficient, leading to more accurate tracking, better monitoring, and timely interventions when needed**.**

# Flexi Fund

State Govt. shall include IEC and other such activities under Flexi Fund which are not covered as an intervention under the programme within 10% of total allocation on sharing of expenses between Central and State Government in the ratio of 60:40 (General States, Delhi and Puducherry)/90:10 (NE & Himalayan states) and 100:00 for UTs.

# Information, Education and Communication (IEC)

*   *   Awareness initiatives under NMEO-OS shall focus on two primary target groups: producers (farmers) and consumers. Producer-centric efforts will concentrate on educating farmers about sustainable oilseed cultivation practices, capacity building of stakeholders, adoption of high-yielding varieties, and the benefits of government schemes. Consumer- centric awareness will focus on promoting optimal consumption of edible oils, raising awareness of their nutritional value, and generating demand for healthy indigenous oils.
    *   To facilitate producer and consumer centric education and engagement, VCPs, TSAs, ICAR, State Agricultural Universities and other institutions will be involved in creating and disseminating relevant content. MANAGE will play a crucial role in providing guidance and assistance to these institutions to ensure alignment with the goals of NMEO- OS. These efforts will include training programs, workshops, demonstrations of new technologies, and distribution of educational materials.
    *   Besides local governance bodies such as panchayats and municipal corporations, will also be roped in for generating awareness among the general public. Key activities will include community outreach programs, local workshops, and media campaigns to increase awareness and consumer participation.
    *   States may undertake activities under Flexi-Fund as per the Guidelines for Flexi- Fund within Centrally Sponsored Schemes issued on 6th September 2016 (see **Annexure 7**).
