## (8) C. Value chain Marketing

*   1.  **Branding, labeling, packaging, publicity and certification of processing units etc**

Lack of special and unique attributes that distinguishes the organic produce hampers the price premium, Indian farmers can realize in domestic and international market. Indian organic produce also suffers from the lack of brand identity, therefore it is necessary that a “**India Organic Produce**” brand identity is created. North Eastern states being blessed with natural advantage of quality and uniqueness can be the first brand ambassadors of India Organic Produce.

Northeastern states collectively and independently need to build such brand identity to visually propagate values, narratives and quality parameters. Marketing and advertising agencies can be engaged to create this unique identity.

Communication and outreach to the potential markets is key to success in changing the perception of organic as luxury purchase to affordable and accessible commodity for the good of soil, environment and human health. This will entail creating a communication plan and program with road shows, market days, online campaigns using social media and Internet and mobile apps. Through this it is targeted to crate a communication and outreach mechanism through which the potential and brand value of organic produce can be communicated.

Brand building also require programs to train growers, farmers and producers in inculcating branding principles in their packaging and their handling of the products. Programs are also needed to train logistics providers, marketers and other value chain partners in upholding the brand value from time to time. State Lead agencies shall draw a comprehensive plan in consultation with Mission Head Quarter to have synergistic efforts by all states to realize the goals.

State lead agencies can assist farmers and FPCs in developing common packaging and labeling, common literature and common brand promotion material as a part of branding and market initiative.

Certification of processing units for organic, HACCP etc can also be covered under this component.

## Seminars/ conferences, workshops, Buyer-seller meets, Auction meetings, festivals

To create awareness in the market and trading fraternity state Lead Agencies shall organize seminar/ conferences, workshops, buyer seller meets and time to time auction meets in their state or at places of market importance in other states with participation of selected production and value chain operators. Participation in exhibitions, trade fairs and organic festivals can also be facilitated. Details of funds provided and year-wise break up is given in Annexure I.

## Consumer awareness Information dissemination through publicity, printed literature, films and local advertisements

State lead agencies shall draw a comprehensive plan for systematic launching of campaign for consumer awareness and product information through print and electronic media publicity, distribution of quality literature, video films and local advertisements.

## Hiring of space in prime markets

State lead agency shall facilitate effective marketing launch of their value added organic products through periodic market campaigns in selected cities of the country by hiring spaces in prime locations and malls to create awareness and demonstrate the quality and uniqueness of their products. Services of market promotion and event management firms can be hired for such services.

## D. Value Chain Support Agencies

*   1.  **Setting up of Lead agency**
        1.  **Staff, Manpower, Travel and contingencies, Institutional strengthening and hire/ purchase of machinery and equipments** \- To effectively implement the mission objectives the states need to create dedicated Lead Agency in the form of Organic Commodity Board or Organic Mission. Each state shall be entitled to receive 5% of total approved allocation for State Lead Agency management. The expenses include cost of hiring of staff and manpower on contractual basis, travel and contingencies, institutional strengthening and hire/ purchase of machinery and equipments

**D.1.2. Setting up of certification bodies –** States having large area under organic certification/ conversion can set up their own certification bodies. SLEC need to ascertain the need and economical viability for setting up of such bodies. Only one time grant will be provided for hiring consultants, preparation of operating and quality manual, training and exposure of manpower and institutional expenses needed to make the agency operational. Entire manpower cost shall have to be borne by the states.

## Mission management at DAC&FW

*   *   1.  **Mission Headquarter –** To effectively implement the mission objectives and to coordinate the states a Mission headquarter having (a) Mission Management Cell and (b) Information and Knowledge Ecosystem management cell will be set up at DAC&FW level. Rs 200 lakh have been provided for mission management at central level. Entire manpower/ professionals/ Advisor etc shall be hired on co-terminus contactual basis for mission tenure.

## Any other Innovative requirement including surveys, consultancies information and knowledge ecosystem etc

*   *   *   1.  **Baseline surveys, market research and mapping and Consultancy services–** So far no consumer study has been undertaken to measure the

market potential of organic produce in the country and international markets for the Indian produce. Therefore it would be important to undertake baseline surveys, market and potential market analysis by geography and also value potential of each produce focusing on northeastern states in particular and other states in general. DAC&FW shall facilitate such surveys to devise appropriate marketing strategy.

DAC&FW will also coordinate the development of appropriate technology packages for crop production, processing etc through ICAR and other technology developing institutes.

**D2.2.2 Information and Knowledge Ecosystems including traceability platform** – Today there is no single information and knowledge ecosystem for the Indian organic produce. Also there is no transparent platform available for traceability and on-line two-way marketing platform linking farmers to buyers and buyers to consumers. Therefore to fill this crucial gap we need to develop a information and knowledge ecosystem which can ensure:

*   *   *   *   *   Involvement of all stakeholders through dynamic, easy to use and accessible system where all stakeholders can become members
                *   The system must also be a market place where online selling and buying can be done under market economics
                *   All information on the produce, its geography, quality, certifications and traceability etc can be accessed
                *   Knowledge and information is accessible through videos, podcasts, audio notes, visual demonstrations, presentations etc can be disseminated and shared with other stakeholders
                *   The platform must be available in all major states and regional languages besides in Hindi and English
                *   The platform should be accessible through mobile devices and apps and if needed through offline call centers accessible through voice mails and phones.

The information and knowledge ecosystem shall be functioning from Mission Head Quarter and shall comprise of hardware, software and BPO professionals including call centre services as per the need assessment and approved by the Executive Committee.

**D.2.2.3 Any other innovative requirement –** Adequate provisions have been made at DAC&FW level to meet the expenses of the states on innovative components needed for successful development of value chain. Only those innovative components, which are not covered under the scheme and also could

not be met from other schemes, will be considered on need assessment on case- to-case basis.

1.  **State Lead Agency to Ensure Implementation keeping end goals in sight** The state Lead Agency will be responsible for implementation of Mission objectives, utilization of funds and for submission of periodical reports and utilization certificate.

Ensuring integration of all Mission components to form an end-to-end value chain with effective market linkages will be the final aim of the Lead Agency. The agency shall also ensure that entire Mission implementation is done in such a way that there is effective linkage and coordination between farmer companies, resource agencies and private entrepreneurs for long term sustainability with commercial viability.
