**Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana**

**Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)** was launched from Kharif 2016 with aim to support production in agriculture by providing an affordable crop insurance product to ensure comprehensive risk cover for crops of farmers against all non- preventable natural risks from pre-sowing to post-harvest stage. The Scheme has completed 16 crop seasons and is being implemented across States/Union Territories (UTs).

After the commencement of the Scheme, The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (MoA\&FW), Government of India (GoI) has endeavored to make the Scheme more effective, transparent and auto-administration driven with the intention to minimize manual interventions and eliminate usage of variable methodologies for implementation and execution on the ground. This was facilitated by a detailed set of Operational Guidelines (OGs) and by leveraging efﬁcient and cutting-edge technological solutions.

Based on the past experiences of implementing the scheme (between 2016-2020), study reports of various research institutions and feedback received from stakeholders, the scheme was reviewed, and the revised OGs were brought into effect from 01st October 2018 addressing major challenges. Also, the Revamped Operational Guidelines effective from Kharif 2020, addressed the issues related to long-term tendering, optional coverage to all farmers, increase in the scope of risk cover and the addition of add-on covers. During the implementation of the scheme between 2020 & 2022, many representations have come from State Governments/UT Administrations for flexibility in terms of implementation of the scheme as per State/UT specific cropping practices and options for alternate risk management models to manage the risk protection to farmers within given budgetary provisions. Accordingly, Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DA\&FW), GoI initiated multiple stakeholder consultations with State Governments/UT Administrations, Farmers Organizations, Insurance Companies (ICs), Re-Insurance Companies, Financial Institutions, Research and Technical Organizations and the Ministries & Departments of the GoI and also constituted working groups for gap analysis and identification of alternate models for Risk Management and Infusion of Technology to address the demands of the State/UTs and also to address key challenges associated with implementation of the scheme. In this new iteration of the Operational Guidelines of PMFBY, an effort has been made to provide more flexibility to the State/UTs in terms of implementation of the scheme, to inculcate financial discipline amongst the stakeholders and to infuse technological interventions within the scheme framework, so as to bring transparency, objectivity and minimize the potential hazards & disputes.

These operational Guidelines shall be effective from Kharif 2023 onwards and shall be overriding any provisions or clauses of Tender Document or Contract or Notification of the State Govts./UTs or conditions or processes which are not in conformity to these guidelines. Any dispute or grievance of any stakeholder related to implementation of the scheme shall be addressed as per the provisions of these guidelines only. Accordingly, the Operational Guidelines 2023 have been updated and approved for ready reference and adoption by all the stakeholders for effective implementation of the PMFBY. All the powers of GoI shall be exercised by the Department/Ministry designated to execute/implement crop insurance schemes in

the country, which in this case shall be the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (DA\&FW), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (MoA\&FW), Government of India (GoI) and hereafter, the same shall be referred to as **‘GoI’** in this document.

1. # **Objective of the Scheme**

   PMFBY aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture sector by way of:

* Providing ﬁnancial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events.

* Stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming.

* Encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices.

* Ensuring credit worthiness of the farmers, crop diversiﬁcation and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides protecting the farmers from production risks.

* Promoting innovation & research of insurance and allied products so-as-to offer expanded choice to the farmers and the State Governments/UT Administrations.

2. # **Adoption of Technology for Scheme Administration**

## **Digital Technology**

1. In an endeavor to integrate Technology in implementation and execution of the Scheme, GoI has designed and developed a National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) ([www.pmfby.gov.in)](http://www.pmfby.gov.in/) which has been in use since Kharif 2018\. This has brought in for better administration and coordination amongst stakeholders viz. Farmers, States, Insurers, insurance intermediaries and Banks as well as ensure real- time dissemination of information and transparency in implementation.

   2. Continued & efficient functioning of the Portal successfully calls for responsible participation by different stakeholders who will have the responsibility for census coding and regular updating of revenue/administrative units, AWS code mapping and requisite information/details as per the login credential module.

   3. Implementing State/UTs and Insurance Companies during each crop season are required to digitize and upload basic information like notiﬁed areas, crops, sum insured, Government subsidy and premium to be paid by farmers and name of the implementing Insurance Company in the particular insurance unit etc., on the portal well within the prescribed timeline. This will facilitate farmers and other stakeholders to get the relevant information on the Internet and through SMS for the concerned season. State/UT Government and concerned Insurance Company will be responsible for any incorrect entry/ errors/ omissions etc. during digitization.

   4. Digitization of basic information/notiﬁcation should compulsorily be done before ﬂoating tender documents which will be followed by the entry of L1 Premium rates and name of the selected Insurance Company immediately after ﬁnalization of bids and issuance of work order.

   5. Since the NCIP has been operationalized for auto administration and seamless ﬂow of data/information/reports on real-time basis, the State/UT Government would not

   be allowed to create/use a separate Portal/website for Crop Insurance purposes\*. (\*State of Karnataka which is already running its own portal will have to integrate with NCIP).

   6. All Stakeholders have deﬁned roles and responsibilities and accessibility to related modules on the Portal for the administration of the Scheme. Details of the operationalization of modules for each stakeholder are available on the Portal.

   7. Secured credential/login, preferably linked with Aadhaar Number and mobile One Time Password (OTP) based, for all Stakeholders viz, GoI, State Governments/UT Administrations, Banks, empaneled Insurance Companies and their designated ﬁeld functionaries, Insurance Intermediaries etc. will be provided on the Portal to enable them to enter/upload/download the requisite information.

   8. The Insurance Companies shall not distribute/collect/allow any other proforma/utility/web-Portal etc. for collecting details of insured farmers separately. However, they may provide all requisite support to facilitate Bank Branches/Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) /Common Service Centers (CSCs)/Banking Correspondents (BCs) for uploading the farmers' details on the Portal well within the prescribed cut-off dates.

   9. Only those farmers whose data is uploaded on the NCIP, and their share of premium has been remitted to the concerned Insurance Company within the prescribed time limit, shall be eligible for Insurance coverage. The premium subsidy from the State/UT and the GoI shall be released accordingly as per the timelines and modalities defined in the Operational Guidelines.

   10. All data pertaining to crop-wise, Insurance Unit (IU) wise historical yield data, Notional value of average yield/Scale of Finance (SOF), Sown Area, Coverage and Claims data, Threshold Yield (TY) and Actual Yield (AY) shall be made available/uploaded by the State/UT Government on the NCIP for the purpose of premium rating, claim calculation, etc. For the calculation of admissible claims for RWBCIS, requisite information like weather data, detailed term sheet with triggers and exit values and notional sum insured etc. will be uploaded on the NCIP by the concerned State/UT Government. The data uploaded on the NCIP shall be the only single source of truth and mandatorily shall be provided to the Insurance Companies along with Bid Document for Burn Cost calculation and Risk Pricing. No other source of data shall be used for Risk Pricing for Bidding in the tenders other than the data uploaded and approved by State/UTs on the NCIP. In case this clause is not adhered to, the Government of India share of subsidy shall not be released for the concerned State/UT.

   11. The Banks/Financial Institutions (FIs)/other intermediaries need to compulsorily transfer the individual farmer's data electronically to the NCIP. Accordingly, banks/FIs **may endeavor to undertake Core Banking Solution (CBS) integration** in a time bound manner for real-time transfer of information/data.

   12. The NCIP having details of insured farmers under PMFBY shall be dovetailed with Kisan Rin Portal (KRP), having details of all the farmers availing subsidized short term agriculture loans through Kisan Credit Card under Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS) of the GoI & PM KISAN database having pre-identified farmers receiving benefits under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme of GoI. The

   data/information of both the Schemes shall be auto synchronized to enable real-time sharing of information and better program monitoring.

   13. With a view to keep pace with the massive innovations happening for making agriculture financially resilient and to achieve the objective of meeting Sustainable Development Goals, the scheme envisages to foster the innovation and development of effective technology solutions under PMFBY ecosystem to make the scheme more effective and farmers more resilient & protected. Implementing Insurance Companies may contribute funds in order to promote innovation and research & collaborate with the technical institutions, start-ups/Fin-tech/Insure-tech & Agri-tech entities of the country & across the globe. The potential technologies solutions shall be first evaluated and recommended by GoI for pilot-rollout. The pilots shall be carried out by the implementing Insurance Companies collectively and/or individually for strengthening the technology models and solutions for PMFBY. Further, the GoI shall review and examine the results of such pilots/research for final adoption within scheme ecosystem.

## **Remote Sensing & Other Technologies**

14. The Insurance Companies & States/UTs shall compulsorily use innovative technology & mobile applications for monitoring of crop health through CROPIC App, reporting of crop damage through Crop Loss Assessment App and Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) through CCE Agri App etc., in coordination with the concerned State/UTs. State/UTs shall also facilitate Insurance Companies with Satellite Imagery wherever required and facilitate usage of drones as per the SOP issued by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, GoI. Such data and information may further be sourced and utilized for further analysis under the purview of PMFBY. Insurance Companies can also use the services of the Government or technical agencies empaneled by the GoI or its authorized agency or committee for conducting relevant studies & validation for better monitoring and ground-truth. Insurance Companies should play an active role of being partners in facilitating and promotion of use of technology and other innovations in the scheme implementation.

    15. The Department of the State/UT Government responsible for managing the digital land record and its web-portal will facilitate the integration of land record with NCIP and provide Application Programming Interface (API), free of cost, for smooth access to the land records of the concerned farmer for validation on NCIP.

    16. Suitable technology & modalities shall also be explored and adopted for using Smart Sampling Technique (SST) for conducting CCEs required for arriving at proportionate Crop Yield Estimation along with direct yield estimation using different technology models as prescribed in YES-TECH Manual 2023\.

    17. Yield Estimation System based on Technology (YES-TECH) for direct estimation of yield at Gram Panchayat (GP) level has been rolled out from Kharif 2023 season onwards as per the provisions of YES-TECH Manual 2023, as amended from time to time.

    18. YES-TECH shall be further augmented through Collection of Real-time Photos and Observations of Crops (CROPIC) initiative, wherein crop health will be monitored by taking periodic photos of standing or peril-affected crop at pre-determined interval of its growth with GPS coordinates, three to five times during the season for assessing the crop condition at different stages of the crop life cycle.

    19. A national level network of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) & Automatic Rain Gauges (ARG) shall also be established under the Weather Information Network Data System (WINDS) initiative as per the provisions of the WINDS Manual 2023, as amended from time to time, creating a strong and resilient platform for generation of long-term hyper-local weather data information for Crop insurance, agriculture

    advisory and disaster risk resilience needs of different sectors.

    20. State/UTs shall adopt use of technology, such as satellite imagery, drones, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and remote sensing for various applications such as crop area estimation, yield disputes resolution and promote innovation and use of technology solutions such as remote sensing and other related technology solutions and mobile applications for CCE planning, yield estimation, loss assessment, assessment of prevented sowing and clustering of districts etc.

    21. Use of technology derived solutions for calculation of Yield will be triggered in the following instances when:

    Requisite number of CCEs have not been conducted at the Insurance Unit (IU) level or one level higher than the IU level.

    22. Or

    The yield data submitted by the Nodal Department of the State/UT Government is disputed by the IC due to non-compliance of the deﬁned procedure for conducting CCEs.

    23. Or

    The Nodal Department of State/UT Government is unable to submit Actual or approved yield data (CCE Agri App based) for at-least 90% of total Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) conducted, within 2 months of the cut-off date of completion of CCEs.

    24. To develop a framework for Research Studies & Working Papers by academia & Multilateral bodies, GoI may enter into bilateral or multilateral arrangements / agreements with any relevant national / international institutions/organizations, for the purpose.

3. # **Coverage of Farmers**

   1. All farmers including sharecroppers and tenant farmers growing the notiﬁed cropsin the notiﬁed areas are eligible for coverage. However, farmers should have insurable interest on the insured crops and lands. Such farmers are required to submit necessary documentary evidence of land records prevailing in the State (Records of Right (RoR), Land Possession Certiﬁcate (LPC) etc.) and/or applicable contract/ agreement details/ other documents notiﬁed/ permitted by concerned State Governments/UT Administrations pertaining to sharecroppers/tenant farmers and the same should be deﬁned by the respective States/UTs in the notiﬁcation itself. Tribal farmers and forest dwellers having cultivation in forest land under FRA are also allowed to be insured under the scheme. The farmers cultivating community owned land especially as is practiced in NER states are also allowed to be covered under the scheme with certification from village head or revenue authorities. All such farmers are also required to essentially submit Aadhaar Number and declaration about the crop sown/ crops intended to be sown.

      1. ## **Farmers availing the Kisan Credit Card (KCC)/Crop Loan/Loanee Farmers**

         1. The scheme is optional for all farmers including farmers who have been sanctioned short-term Seasonal Agricultural Operations (SAO) loans though Kisan Credit Card (KCC) for the notiﬁed crops from deﬁned Financial Institutions (hereinafter referred to as Loanee farmers). Existing Loanee farmers who do not want to get covered

   under the scheme have the option of opting-out from the Schemes by submitting requisite declaration to loan sanctioning bank branches any time during the year but at least seven days prior to the cut-off date for enrolment of farmers for the respective season. All those farmers who do not submit the declaration would be essentially covered.

         2. Farmer whose KCC loan has become sub-standard as deﬁned and as per prevailing practices of the concerned Banks and/or Government regulator shall not be considered as a Loanee farmer. However, bank branches may facilitate such farmers for enrolment as non-loanee farmers.

         3. Merely, sanctioning of crop loan against other collateral securities including ﬁxed deposits, gold/jewel loans, mortgage loans etc. **without having insurable interest of the farmer on the insurable land and notiﬁed crops shall not be eligible for coverage under the Scheme**.

      2. ## **Other Farmers/Non-loanee Farmers**

   As mentioned in **Para 3.1.1.1** above, the Scheme is optional for all farmers including non-loanee farmers/other farmers.

         1. The insurance coverage will strictly be equivalent to the sum insured per hectare, as deﬁned in the Government notiﬁcation or /and on NCIP multiplied by proposed insured- area for notiﬁed crop for enrolment.

      3. Special efforts shall be made to ensure maximum coverage of Scheduled Caste (SC)/ Scheduled Tribe (ST)/ Women farmers under the Scheme. Further Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) may be involved in the extension activities and awareness creation among farmers and obtaining feedback from farmers about the implementation of the Scheme.

      4. The implementing Insurance Company selected as lowest rate bidder (L1) will be responsible for taking necessary measures to ensure at least 10% incremental increase in coverage of non-loanee farmers in the allocated district. However, other empaneled Insurance Companies which have participated in the bidding process and are keen for enrolment of non-loanee farmers in the cluster may also be allowed to enroll non-loanee farmers at L1 premium rate using their respective network of intermediaries and manpower using digital platform of App for Intermediary Enrollment (AIDE) and NCIP. The interested companies must inform their willingness in writing within 7 days of the ﬁnalization of tender/issuance of work order to L1. It will however be the responsibility of all the Insurance Company engaged in this process to ensure that duplicate enrolment does not happen in the given cluster/district and therefore shall mandatorily use AIDE App for the purpose. Engaging companies other than L1 for enrolling non-loanee farmers is allowed for all Districts notiﬁed and allocated by the State Governments/UT Administrations. The enrolment of non-loanee farmers shall be as per the conditions laid down in **Para 17.7.**

      5. These Insurance Companies shall use digital means such as AIDE App for enrollment of farmers and complete the process as per the seasonality discipline detailed in **Para 16.4**. The same Insurance Company which has enrolled the farmers shall be liable for the payment of claims to such farmers basis the localized crop

   damage assessment conducted by the L1 Insurance Company or crop damage report and crop yield data given by the concerned State Govt.

      6. The exchange of information and co-witnessing of CCEs for the district by the Government/NCIP will be limited to L1 Company only and it will be binding on other companies to accept the yield data. The Nodal Department of State Governments/UT Administrations shall share the yield data with all concerned Insurance Companies for the computation of claims in the relevant IUs where they have enrolled non-loanee farmers. Requisition for payment of Government subsidy in respect of non-loanee farmers enrolled by the other Insurance Companies shall be submitted directly through NCIP to the Central Nodal Agency designated by GoI for the purpose. Claim calculation for the applications and IUs shall be done simultaneously on NCIP based on the relevant crop-wise, IU-wise crop damage and yield data, weather data etc. entered/shared by the respective State Governments/UT Administrations.

      7. A detailed SOP/Manual and modalities of the enrollment of non-loanee farmers at L1 premium rate by other unsuccessful bidders shall be notified by the GoI separately.

   2. ## **Universal Coverage**

      1. The States / UTs shall make all efforts for providing insurance protection to all the farmers including tenant farmers, sharecroppers as well as loanee or non-loanee farmers in their respective State /UT. To achieve this Universal Coverage under PMFBY, States/UTs may adopt following approaches:

         1. **Full Universalization:** Complete farmer database would be fetched on the NCIP through the pre-validated, Land Parcel, Crop & Farmers KYC database of the concerned State/UT. Enrolment through any other channels will not be required under full universal coverage. The States may consider for opting full universalization in the interest of the farmers with following pre-requisites:

            * Digitized Land Records

            * Farm level Season-wise Crop Data

            * Farm Level KYC validated Farmer’s Database

            * Data collection as per PMFBY Requirements

            * API based Data Exchange with NCIP

         2. **Preferential Universalization:** The States/UTs can incentivize the enrolment of farmers under the scheme by subsidizing the farmer’s premium partially or completely. State/UT may decide to deduct a token amount from the farmer’s account during enrolment. Farmers will be enrolled through the traditional enrolment channels under the scheme.

4. # **Coverage of Crops**

1. Food crops (Cereals, Millets and Pulses).

2. Oilseeds.

3. Annual Commercial / Annual Horticultural crops.

4. In addition, pilots for coverage can be taken up for those perennial horticultural/commercial crops for which standard methodology for yield estimation

or correlation between weather condition and yield/output is available.

5. Other crops including plantations crops may also be included in the scope of scheme subject to approval of respective ministries of Govt. of India. A separate communication shall be issued by the GoI as and when such inclusions are required and approved.

5. # **Coverage of Risks and Exclusions**

   1. **Basic Cover:** The basic cover under the scheme covers the risk of yield loss to standing crops (sowing to harvesting). This comprehensive risk insurance is provided to cover yield losses on an area-based approach basis, against non- preventable risks like drought, dry spells, ﬂood, inundation, wide-spread pest and disease attack, landslides, natural ﬁre due to lightening, storm, hailstorm, and cyclone.

   2. **Add-On Coverage:** Apart from the mandatory basic cover, the State Governments/UT Administrations, in consultation with the State Level Coordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI) may choose any or all of the following add- on covers, based on the need of the speciﬁc crop/area in their State/UT to cover the following stages of the crop and risks leading to crop loss.

      1. **Prevented Sowing/Planting/Germination Risk:** Insured area is prevented from sowing/planting/germination due to deﬁcit rainfall or adverse seasonal/climatic conditions.

      2. **Mid-Season Adversity:** Loss in case of adverse seasonal conditions during thecrop season viz. ﬂoods, prolonged dry spells and severe drought etc., wherein expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of the normal yield.This add-on feature facilitates the provision for immediate relief (On- Account payment) to insured farmers in case of occurrence of such risks.

      3. **Post-Harvest Losses:** Coverage is available only up to a maximum period of two weeks from harvesting, for those crops which are required to be dried in cut and spread / small, bundled condition depending on requirement of the crops in that area and left in the ﬁeld after harvesting, against speciﬁc perils of hailstorm, cyclone, cyclonic rains and unseasonal rains.

      4. **Localized Calamities:** Loss/damage to notiﬁed insured crops resulting from occurrence of identiﬁed localized risks of hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst and natural ﬁre due to lightening affecting isolated farms in the notiﬁed area.

      5. **Add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals:** The States/UTs may consider providing add-on coverage for crop loss due to the attack by wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be substantial and is identiﬁable. The detailed protocol and procedure for evaluation of the bids has been prepared by the GoI in consultation with the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MOEF\&CC) and General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC Re). The add-on coverage will be optional for the farmers and applicable premium, in full, shall be borne by the farmer, however, the State Governments/UT Administrations may consider providing additional subsidy on this coverage, wherever notiﬁed. The Central Govt. subsidy on premium shall not be available for this add-on cover. The actuarial premium rates for this add-on cover should be sought in the bid itself from

   the Insurance Companies, however the add-on actuarial premium rate will be considered separately and shall not form part of evaluation of L1. Detailed modalities are annexed as **Annexure \- I** for adoption by States/UTs.

   3. States/UTs have to notify crop-wise speciﬁc period/duration for coverage of aforesaid add-on risks in their notiﬁcation as detailed in **Para 7.2** of this guideline and the same will also be uploaded on NCIP.

   4. **General Exclusions:** Losses arising out of war and nuclear risks, malicious damage and other preventable risks shall be excluded.

   5. Loss/damage for localized calamities and post-harvest losses will be assessed at the level of the individual insured farm and hence intimation of loss by the farmer/designated agencies or nodal departments is essential. For remaining risks

   i.e. losses due to wide-spread calamities, lodging of intimationfor claims by insured farmers / designated agencies or nodal departments for such wide-spread calamities is not essential. Claims of wide-spread calamity shall be calculated based on the loss assessment report submitted by the District Level Joint Committee (DLJC) and/or actual yield submitted by concerned State Governments/UT Administrations.

   6. Details of indemniﬁcation and claims calculation for aforesaid risk covers are provided in **Para 21\.**

   7. ## **Risk Management Mechanisms under the Scheme**

      1. The Scheme shall operate mainly on complete **‘risk transfer’** approach wherein complete risk is transferred to implementing Insurance Companies. This will involve bearing of the entire claim liability by the insurance company for the discovered premium.

      2. However, if the State Governments/UT Administrations strongly believe that they need to partake in some of the elements of the risk, they may explore opting for **‘risk participation’** approach. This shall entail adoption of alternate models by the States wherein the claims as well as premium surplus is shared between the Government and the implementing insurance company as per the pre-agreed formula. The States may choose to implement any of the following models:

1. Profit & loss sharing model.

2. Cup & Cap model (60:130)

3. Cup & Cap model (80:110)

   3. Any pilot for a model other than those listed above can be taken up in one State at a time with the approval of Union Agriculture Minister and Union Finance Minister.

      4. Following shall be the modalities specific to Risk Participation Approach:

         1. **“Profit & Loss” Sharing Mechanism:**

   8. ## **Sandbox for Agricultural & Rural Security, Technology & Insurance Platform (SARTHI) & Product Innovation**

      1. With a view to enhance the access to agriculture & allied insurance products for farmers and to increase penetration of insurance adoption in the Agri ecosystem, GoI intends to create an ecosystem for varied insurance products (for the agro industry) wherein the different stakeholders of the insurance industry like Insurance companies, Reinsurance companies, Insurance Intermediaries and innovators, like

   Agritech and Fintech, startups can come together and work towards extending customized risk protection solutions to farming community in addition to current crop insurance products under PMFBY & RWBCIS. Other insurance products such as parameterized insurance products for non-notified PMFBY crops, parametric disaster risk insurance products, available product offerings (or components) under earlier run Unified Package Insurance Scheme (UPIS) such as Personal accident, Livestock, Fire (contents & buildings), Life insurance offerings and non-subsidized add-on covers of PMFBY & RWBCIS, among others can be offered to the farming & rural community which will help in bringing financial resilience and risk mitigation in their lives and livelihoods.

      2. GoI for this purpose would explore potential collaborations between different stakeholders to facilitate the development of a comprehensive and secure digital SARTHI platform and dovetail it with NCIP, wherein all insurance product offerings relevant to farming and rural communities around the country such as mentioned above along with current crop insurance products are offered within a single ecosystem of PMFBY through a single window to the target communities, catering to their specific needs. This ecosystem will be capitalized by different actors of the insurance industry resulting in proliferation of all insurance products which can be offered to the agriculture and allied sectors while ensuring end-to-end traceability and transparency of transactions in a secured digital environment.

      3. A unified Agri insurance ecosystem will have the following features:

* Digitization of the Agri & other Insurance product offerings ecosystem in a stable, secure environment.

* Greater degree of information sharing and collaboration between the agriculture and allied sectors and the insurance industry stakeholders.

* Customization of all possible products & their availability for farmers relevant for their demography and profile.

* Cost Reduction in overall premium for farmers leading to increased coverage & earning potential while achieving risk mitigation.

* Higher penetration & accessibility to insurance products for farming & rural communities in different demographics.

* In the long term it’ll also provide specific data to the GoI on the insurance needs of the farmers and other rural stakeholders, which can then be rolled out as schemes for their benefit.

  4. To facilitate a comprehensive risk protection environment for Agriculture and Rural sector, GoI will build an open-source digital platform which will provide seamless integration of different insurance products approved by IRDAI & offered by Insurance Companies and allow for digital distribution of the products via various distribution channels directly to the farmers through a farmer facing application. This digital platform will help offer the bouquet of products curated by the insurance companies for the agriculture & rural communities and will offer custom-made insurance products tailored as per the specific needs and the risks faced by the farmers in different regions across complete agriculture value chain.

     5. Govt. of India though a consultative committee comprising of insurance industry experts, regulators, academia, Insurtech/agri-tech startups and experts from multi-

  lateral national/international agencies and technical agencies/institutions shall oversee and foster the adoption and promotion of SARTHI for rural & agricultural risk protection and resilience development through Insurance mechanism.

     6. IRDAI has also been leveraging digital technology to achieve the vision of “Insurance for All” by 2047 where every citizen has an appropriate life, health and property insurance cover and every enterprise is supported by appropriate insurance solutions. Therefore, IRDAI in addition to various administrative and strategic initiatives is also developing various technology platforms and distribution channels for the purpose of increasing financial risk protection through insurance and thereby enabling a comprehensive risk resilience in Indian communities and economy at large. Accordingly, few digital platforms like Bima Sugam (digital portal for all insurance transactions), Bima Vahak (women centric rural insurance distribution channel), Bima Vistaar (all-in-one affordable insurance product covering risks against life, health, and property) & Bima Bharosa (a platform for complaint registration and grievance redressal) are being developed. SARTHI Platform shall therefore be integrated with all these platforms for seamless information sharing and leveraging mutual capabilities.

     7. A detailed SOP/Manual and modalities of the SARTHI Platform and Product Innovation including the product designing and validation protocols shall be notified by the GoI separately.

All enrolment agencies including banks have to compulsorily take Aadhaar/Aadhaar enrolment number as per the notiﬁcation under the Aadhaar Act before the enrollment or sanction of crop loan under Kisan Credit Card. Hence the coverage of Loanee farmers without Aadhaar shall not be allowed and such accounts need to be reviewed and updated by the concerned bank branch regularly.

    5. ## **Agreement/Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between States and Insurance Companies**

       1. State/UTs and Insurance Companies will enter into an agreement before the commencement of the ﬁrst crop season as per the model agreement shared by the

    GoI and as available on NCIP. The roles and responsibilities of the State/UTs (**Para 38.2**) and Insurance Companies (**Para 38.4**) and provision of performance evaluation matrix and applicable penalties (**Para 33**) shall be a part of the Agreement/MoU document necessarily.

7. # **Tendering and Notiﬁcation**

   1. ## **Procedure for Issuance of Tender by the States/UTs**

      1. Operational Guidelines of PMFBY provides for compulsory tender by the States/UTs for period of 3 years to ensure assured business to Insurance Companies for a longer duration leading to increased commitment towards infrastructure and manpower deployment. State/UTs shall need to take a separate approval from the GoI in case of tenders being called for less than 3 years period, else the GoI share of premium shall not be released for the concerned State/UT for a tender of such short duration.

      2. Updated Model Tender Document as per Operational Guidelines 2023 shall be provided to the States/UTs by GoI separately.

      3. Meeting of the SLCCCI should be convened prior to the commencement of the ﬁrst crop season and well in advance for ﬁnalizing the various terms and conditions and calling of bids/issuance of the bid notice to all empaneled Insurance Companies for selection to implement the Scheme during the risk period.

      4. In order to have transparency, all the details mentioned in the Model Tender Document (**refer Para 7.1.2**) shall mandatorily, be made a part of the tendering process. No modiﬁcation in the terms and conditions enumerated in the tender document shall be allowed post tendering.

      5. States / UTs should ensure the issuance of the tender notice/document and its circulation to all concerned agencies/ departments/ institutions at least three months prior to the commencement of the crop season incorporating all the essential details about insured crops, areas, Sum Insured, Average Yield, Threshold Yield at IU level for notiﬁed crops, opted risk cover, period of contract, bidder's evaluation and selection methodology, premium rate for farmers, Government subsidy along with seasonality discipline/ cut-off dates for each activity etc.

      6. Annexure for bid document may be generated through the Portal including Crop-wise IU location master. The procedure and template for the same are available on NCIP. Before ﬂoating the Tender, last 10 years Average Yield data at the notiﬁed/available level and Threshold Yield at notiﬁed unit along with other information /data should be uploaded on the Portal in the prescribed template and should be made a part of the Tender Document.

      7. The prescribed list of data required to be published along with the tender is detailed below to enable proper risk analysis and correct premium rating, viz. details about the notiﬁed scheme, notiﬁed crops, level of notiﬁed IUs, crop-wise sum insured, crop- wise indemnity level, crop-wise TY at IUs level for notiﬁed crops, desired risk coverages (basic cover, add-on covers) etc.:

1. Details of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS), Automatic Rain Gauges (ARG) or IMD/State Governments/UT Administrations/Private AWS/ARG networks, which have been installed as per the standards and specifications deﬁned in the WINDS

   Manual 2023\.

2. Year wise historical Average Yield data for each notiﬁed crop at the Notiﬁed IU level for past 10 years (including immediately preceding season/year) and this data shall be made available through the NCIP.

3. Year wise, Crop-wise, IU level historical Coverage and Claim data for past 3 years (including immediately preceding season/year) and this data shall be made available through the NCIP.

4. Crop-wise nomenclature of yield being collated and reported along with the conversion factor between the two nomenclatures (if applicable) e.g. Paddy & Rice.

5. List of cluster wise distribution of districts and list of crops proposed to be covered under different risk combinations along with applicable Sum Insured values, indemnity levels and onset of sowing and harvesting dates.

6. Classiﬁcation of irrigated and unirrigated districts in clusters as per irrigation facilities available. If the State/UTs have not categorized irrigated/un-irrigated district, GoI liability will be limited as per the data available/published by Directorate of Economics & Statistics (DES), DA\&FW and further revised from time to time.

7. Details of Alternate Risk Management Models (ARTM) and Yield Estimation Models under YES-TECH as are being adopted by the State Governments/UTs.

   8. **Calculation of the lowest weighted premium of district shall be based on the insured area for notiﬁed crops in each district during last year/season.** However, in the absence of insured area details of last year/season for all proposed crops or any crop, immediately preceding year's available insured area will be considered for calculation of the weighted premium of the district. Only this data will be used for calculation of L1. For new notiﬁed crops, 30% of the average of the last 3 years net sown area, in case of major crops and 10% of the average of the last 3 years net sown area, in case of minor crops shall be considered as weights for the calculation of lowest weighted premium of the district.

      1. Bidding **shall be done through e-tendering** and work order may be released within 2 weeks of the opening of the Tender.

         2. Depending on the risk proﬁle, historical loss cost and cost beneﬁt analysis for the proposed crop(s) in district(s) of any cluster, if the State/UT Government feels that the premium rate likely to be offered by the bidding Insurance Companies would be abnormally high, then the State/UT Government can ﬁx a ceiling on premium rates for such crop(s) proposed to be included in the bidding evaluation for the bidding period. However, recourse to this ceiling provision may be done only in well justiﬁed cases and not as a general practice. The ceiling premium rate may be derived based on statistical evaluation/actuarial premium analysis, loss cost analysis & historical payouts etc. Further, the names of such crops should be disclosed by the State/UT Government compulsorily in the tender document.

         3. In such cases where a ceiling on premium rate has been indicated, the State/UT Government must call ﬁnancial bids in a two-step bidding or in two separate envelopes. The ﬁrst bid/envelope is for disclosing the premium rate offered by each participating Insurance Company for such ceiling crops and must be categorized under "Ceiling Premium Rate" and the 2nd bid envelop is for bidding of crop wise premium rate for all other crops included in tender. Time interval for opening of both

   bid/envelopes should be compulsorily mentioned in the bidding documents and should preferably be on the same day. All participating insurance companies have to submit the bid offer for both categories of crops as per the procedure mentioned above.

      9. The State/UT Government shall ﬁrst evaluate the ﬁrst envelope of the bid keeping in view the premium offered by each individual participating Insurance Company and if the risk propensity and weather susceptibility of the crop and/or historical claim/loss data doesn't support the actuarial rates offered by the participating Insurance Company, such crop(s) may be dropped from the list of proposed crops for notiﬁcation by the State/UT Government and evaluation for L1 bidder should be done strictly based on the rates offered for remaining crops in the 2nd envelope. The second envelope shall be opened by the State/UT Government only after the decision on dropping the proposed crops/or accepting the premium rates offered by the participating Insurance Company has been taken by the State/UT Government. If the State/UT Government decides not to drop all the proposed crop(s)/ few crops for which premium rate was obtained in a separate envelope of the "Ceiling Premium Rate" from the bidding process, then L1 will be calculated by inclusion of the premium offered for both categories of crops i.e., all remaining crops proposed to be covered.

      10. ### **Sum Insured and Indemnity Values for the current tender shall also be uploaded by the State/UTs on NCIP before publishing of Tender. Loss Cost calculation shall be made available for the State/UTs at District Crop & Cluster level on the NCIP under State HQ Login Credentials for evaluation of the premium rates within maximum 3 days of the opening of the tender bids.**

      11. The tender process is the most crucial part of the implementation of the scheme, therefore it is important to ensure that the process is conducted with utmost caution as the rates once opened may distort the future rates and participation of insurers during the re-tendering process. Further the re-tendering without any valid reason not only jeopardies the fairness and impartiality of the process but also becomes prejudiced to the responsive & winning bidders. State/UTs therefore should avoid re- tendering as a general practice. Re-tendering may be held only in exceptional circumstances and only with the prior approval of GoI after submission of a request with detailed reasons, except, in the cases where re-tendering is necessitated due to inadequate participation of Insurance Companies as per the State/UT’s tender evaluation norms. The GoI on its part will give its decision within 5 working days of the receipt of such requests from the State/UTs.

      12. State/UTs are required to compulsorily upload meeting notices, tender documents, addendums, corrigendum, notiﬁcation of award, copy of agreement between State/UT Government and the Insurance Companies and all other requisite and relevant data and information on the Document Management module of NCIP for faster communication and response. Accordingly, the subsequent notiﬁcations, circulars, directives shall also be uploaded on the Portal as and when issued for wider reach and circulation.

      13. All conditions proposed to be stipulated by State/UT Government shall be incorporated in the bid document itself and no new condition should be included in the notiﬁcation. In case Insurance Companies have any objection to any Tender condition which is in conﬂict with the guidelines, they can make a reference to the State/UT Government with a copy to the GoI within 3 days of issuance of the Tender

   Document.

      14. L1 bidder shall not be allowed to withdraw its bid after opening of bids/allotment of work. If L1 bidder withdraws then ﬁnancial loss, if any, to the State/UT Government due to re-tendering /assignment of work to others, due to increase in Actuarial Premium Rate from previously declared L1 rate, shall be recovered from the withdrawing L1 bidder. However, state shall issue work order within 2 weeks of opening of bid.

      15. There would be no further negotiations with the L1 bidder to accept L1 rates of other bidder for any district-crop combination i.e., the rates quoted by the L1 bidder for different district-crop combinations would be applicable within the given cluster.

      16. Bidding and negotiation conditions will be as per Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) guidelines, vide its circular nos. No.005/CRD/012 dated 03rd March 2007 & No.005/CRD/012 dated 20th Jan 2010 and the Manual for Procurement of Consultancy & Other Services (updated June 2022\) and no State/UT level modification of this clause shall be allowed.

      17. ## **Termination of Contract**

          1. Either party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement under speciﬁc situations and conditions as mentioned below after ninety (90) days of issuing a written notice to the other party subject to the condition that if the notice is given within ninety (90) days prior to commencement of a crop season, the said crop season would be implemented fully by the concerned Insurance Company only except for the conditions given below:

             * The concerned Insurance Company is debarred/black-listed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) or GoI.

             * The GoI may also examine the recommendation regarding black-listing of Insurance Company by other competent authorities for taking appropriate decision/compliance.

             * The concerned Insurance Company has failed to maintain the required solvency margin, or the solvency ratio for the ﬁnancial year, as prescribed by IRDAI.

             * The concerned Insurance Company has been de-empaneled by the GoI for the implementation of a crop insurance scheme, as evidenced by the evaluation of performance of Insurer conducted by the authority prior to the Bid Due Date.

             * The State/UT Government and/or Insurer have failed to perform one's core responsibility as prescribed in the Operational Guidelines including but not limited to the payment of premium share by the State/UT Government and payment of claims by the Insurer within the extended timelines.

             * Any material changes in the scheme parameters and modalities of implementation by the GoI.

          2. Termination of agreement by any party due to any other reason not listed above will attract an additional penalty of up to 5% of the total premium. The total premium in this case shall be equal to the total estimated premium for the corresponding remaining year/seasons of the agreement period.

   2. ## **Procedure for Issuance of Notiﬁcation by the States/UTs**

      1. **Notiﬁcation of Crops, Areas and Implementing Agency (IA)**

         1. The Scheme shall operate on the principle of **"Area Approach"** in the selected deﬁned areas called IU. The State/UTs will notify crops and deﬁned areas covered during the season in accordance with the decision taken in the meeting of the SLCCCI. The State/UTs should notify the Village/Village Panchayat or any other equivalent unit as an IU for major crops deﬁned at the District / Taluka or equivalent level. For other crops, it may be a unit of size at or above the level of Village/Village Panchayat depending on the availability of sufﬁcient crop area for statistically sound sampling for the conduct of CCEs. For deﬁning a crop as a major crop anddeciding the IU level, the sown area of that crop should be at least 25% of the GrossCropped Area in a District/Taluka or equivalent level. And this should be appropriately incorporated in the notiﬁcation. **The Notiﬁcation should be issued for at least one year at a time to facilitate banks for deduction of premium for a year and timely data entry on NCIP.**

         2. The State/UTs will notify the type of Risk Coverage opted viz. Basic Cover and Add- on Covers during the season. For the claims arising out of crop damage due to localized risks and post-harvest losses, assessment of the crop damage shall be made on an individual farm basis as outlined in **Para 21, Para 21.5 and 21.6, respectively**.

         3. The SLCCCI, for the purpose of notiﬁcation, will consider factors such as availability of the past yield data based on CCEs for adequate number of years (at least 10 years for the calculation of TY & Loss Cost), cropped acreage and capacity for estimating yield during proposed season, etc. The State/UT Government should endeavor to cover all the major crops grown in all the districts of the State/UT. State/UTs should ensure that a standard methodology of yield estimation or correlation of measurable weather parameters with yield/output exists for all the crops proposed to be notiﬁed (**refer Claim Calculation Methodology at Para 18, 19 & 21).**

         4. The States/UTs should provide all information and data as mentioned above (**Para 7.1.6**) in soft format (in Excel sheet) in English to the Insurance Companies for the risk assessment, calculation of TY, Loss Cost & Premium Rates etc., at the IU level, as detailed in the Model Tender Document and in its absence, the State/UT shall provide the data at the next higher unit/nearest neighboring unit/weighted average of contiguous units, as decided by the SLCCCI. The same data also shall be entered/uploaded, approved and accepted by State/UTs and Insurance Companies on the NCIP. The level and the name of a notiﬁed area of IU must be a part of the notiﬁcation and should be provided at the time of bidding itself. The historical yield data (AY) & Threshold Data (TY) uploaded in NCIP shall be used by CPMU, DA\&FW, GoI for risk analysis, burn cost calculation and premium rating and shall be considered as the only single source of truth.

         5. In case State/UTs propose to notify irrigated and un-irrigated (rainfed) areas under a crop separately, they shall ensure that minimum CCEs are planned and conducted for irrigated and rainfed crops separately in such areas. In addition, past yield data for requisite number of years will have to be made available separately for both. **In case village is the IU, for better representative sampling of CCEs and to avoid moral hazard, notiﬁcation of both irrigated and rainfed crops in the same IU**

   ### **should be avoided**.

         6. While notifying the crop(s) where a speciﬁc conversion factor is being used for reporting of yield such as in the case of rice/paddy etc., due care should be taken by the State/UT Nodal Department to use the relevant speciﬁc nomenclature for disclosure of Average Yield, Threshold Yield and Actual Yield while releasing the tender document and submission of yield data and crop yield estimation data for the calculation of admissible claims. The Insurance Company will also be responsible for prior scrutiny of the Tender document for such details. Information/data provided in the Tender document will be treated as ﬁnal and in case of any error/ misreporting/disparity, the State/UT Government and the Insurance Company will be equally liable for payment of additional claims, arising on account of it, if any, in equal proportion.

         7. For the current season or subsequent seasons (in a multi-year contract), the State/UTs, if required, can notify additional IUs or de-notify certain IUs subject to maximum deviation of 10% of the already notiﬁed IUs for the crop within a district at the same premium rate, before the cut-off date for debit of premium. If the deviation is \>10% or in case of addition of a new crop, the actuarial premium rate may be based on the calculation of weighted average premium rate as prevalent in contiguous districts or by applying appropriate loading on the existing premium rate. The rates for such crops will be determined /veriﬁed by the Central PMU and its decision will be binding on both the State/UTs and the insurance companies.

         8. In case of creation/re-organization of any new IU/Districts by the State Governments/UT Administrationsafter the ﬁnalization of tender, it shall be included in the scheme with the same terms and conditions as parent IU/Districts from the next season within the contract period. In case an IU moves out of a district to be part of another existing district then concurrently corresponding district (the district in which IU is moving) rates will be applied. In case of formation of a district by re-organizing a portion of more than one district then weighted average premium rate for each notiﬁed crop will be determined by considering the last season's insured area for the concerned part of district as weight.

         9. **The GoI shall incentivize each primary worker or field functionary involved in conducting crop cutting experiment through CCE Agri App of GoI by Rs. 150 per CCE for encouraging using technology solutions and ensuring transparency in the operationalization of Crop Yield Estimation process. The SOP for conducting crop yield estimation through CCEs and modalities for payment of incentives directly to the primary worker shall be shared by the GoI separately.**

   3. ## **Notiﬁcation of Indemnity Level, Average Yield and Threshold Yield**

      1. Scheme provides for adoption of three levels of Indemnity, viz., 70%, 80% and 90%. State/UT Government in consultation with the SLCCCI shall ﬁnalize the indemnity levels for notiﬁed crops at the district level and the same shall be provided in the tender document. The Threshold Yield shall be notiﬁed in the Tender for the current season and the same will be used for claim calculation for that season. The Average Yield of a notiﬁed crop in IU will be the average yield of the best ﬁve years out of the last seven years. The Threshold Yield of the notiﬁed crop is equal to the Average Yield multiplied by the Indemnity level. **The Threshold Yield for any crop and IU,**

   ### **as declared in the tender document issued by the State/UT, shall compulsorily be part of the notiﬁcation for the season/contract period and shall not change at any point during that season/year/contract period.**

      2. The Indemnity level of the district-crop combination should be prescribed in the tender and will remain the same during the entire contract period. In case of re- organization/creation of new districts, similar provisions as detailed in **Para 7.2.1.8** will be applicable. In case of formation of new district by re-organizing portions of more than one existing districts, then weighted average indemnity level by considering the last season area insured of each notiﬁed crop as weight with rounding-off to the nearest Indemnity level deﬁned under the Operational Guidelines will be the applicable Indemnity level. This will be applicable for the tender duration only.

      3. **The calculation and notiﬁcation of Threshold Yield** – For calculation of Threshold Yield, historical average yield of the best ﬁve out of last seven years and applicable indemnity level shall be considered. Further Threshold Yield should be deﬁned only at the notiﬁed IU level and once included in the notiﬁcation issued by the State/UT, it should not be changed at a later stage under any circumstances. In case of multi- year contract, the Threshold Yield for the subsequent years shall be adopted choosing one of the following methods for computation:

         1. **Fixed Threshold Yield –** Threshold Yield as derived from the best 5 of the immediate last 7 years crop yield data and notiﬁed indemnity level, will remain unchanged for the entire contract period. The premium rates quoted by Insurance Companies will remain unchanged for the entire contract period. It is described in the Illustration 1 below:

### **Illustration 1: Fixed Threshold Yield Assumption:**

If past 7 years yield at Insurance unit level are as below:

| Year | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---- |
| Yield | 1,500 | 1,700 | 1,600 | 1,900 | 1,850 | 1,400 | 2,000 |

### **Threshold Yield:**

Threshold Yield calculated as per formula below:

Formula \= \[(Ʃ Best 5-year Yield) X Notiﬁed Indemnity level\] ÷ 5

Under this method the Threshold Yield calculated in year 1 will remain constant across IUs during the entire contract period as illustrated in the table below:

| Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
| :---- | ----: | :---- | :---- |
| Indemnity Level | 70% | 70% | 70% |
| Threshold Yield | 1,267 | 1,267 | 1,267 |

### **Premium Rate:**

Under this method Premium rate quoted by The Insurance Company in ﬁrst year will remain same throughout the tender period. For example, if the premium rate quoted by

insurance company for a district crop combination is 13% and then it will remain 13% for the entire contract period as illustrated in the table below:

| Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
| :---- | :---: | :---- | :---- |
| Premium Rate | 13% | 13% | 13% |

### **Evaluation of tender process and determination of L1 Company:**

Under this method, every Insurance Company will quote premium rate for each district crop combination notiﬁed by concerned State/UT. L1 will be determined on the basis of lowest weighted average premium rate considering last corresponding season's area insured as weights for all crops combined for that cluster.

2. **Laddered Threshold Yield \-** If the district level average change in yield for a crop over immediately preceding 7 years is negative then ﬁxed TY mentioned as in **Para 7.3.3.1**, above shall apply. Otherwise, immediately preceding 7 years district level average growth rate in yield will be used to ﬁx the Threshold Yield for each of the subsequent two seasons of all concerned IUs for these seasons within the contract period and same shall be pre-notiﬁed at the time of tender itself. Insurance Company shall quote one rate of the premium for all the seasons accordingly. Lowest bid shall be determined considering last year's insured area as detailed in **Para 7.2**. To ensure clarity in the understanding, two illustrations 2 & 3 have been provided below:

   *\*Note \- District level average yield is a crop speciﬁc simple average of yields across the IUs in a district. This exercise is to be performed for each crop notiﬁed in a district.*

### **Illustration 2: Laddered TY- Negative growth rate in last 7 years yield Assumptions**

If last 7-year district level average yield of a crops notiﬁed is as:

| Year | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | ----: |
| Yield | 1,000 | 1,000 | 1,600 | 1,900 | 1,850 | 1,400 | 400 |

### **Indemnity Level-70% Threshold Yield:**

Here, average yield growth rate in last 7 years \= \- 3.27% as calculated below:

(1,000/1,000-1) \+ (1,600/1,000-1) \+ (1,900/1,600-1) \+ (1,850/1,900-1) \+ (1,400/1,850-1) \+ (400/1,400)-1)\]/6

In this case since average growth rate in last 7years yield is negative, Threshold Yield will remain constant for the concerned crop across IUs, across the contract period as below:

| Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
| :---- | :---: | :---- | :---: |
| Indemnity Level | 70% | 70% | 70% |
| Threshold Yield | 1,085 | 1,085 | 1,085 |

*Note1 \- Yield for each Crop to be notiﬁed in a district needs evaluation and check for its growth rate to set-up TYs for different years in a contract period.*

*Note2 \- Please note that TY needs to be calculated at IU level with the data related to respective IUs.*

### **Premium Rate:**

It will remain same across the contract period like Illustration I.

### **Evaluation of tender process and determination of L1 Company:**

Under this method, every insurance company will quote the premium rate for each district crop combination notiﬁed by State/UT Government. L1 will be determined on the basis of lowest weighted average rate considering last year insured area as weight.

### **Illustration 3: Laddered TY- Positive growth rate in last 7 years yield Assumptions**

District level average yield considering yield of all crops notiﬁed is as below:

| Year | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Yield | 1,000 | 1,000 | 1,600 | 1,900 | 1,850 | 1,400 | 1,200 |

### **Indemnity Level-70%**

Method

Average Yield growth rate in last 7 years \= 6.25% as calculated below:

(1,000/1,000-1) \+ (1,600/1,000-1) \+ (1,900/1,600-1) \+ (1,850/1,900-1) \+ (1,400/1,850-1)

\+ (1,200/1,400)-1)\]/6

In this case since average growth rate in last 7-years yield is positive (6.25%). Threshold yield of each IU for that crop will vary with the same growth rate as below:

| Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
| :---- | :---: | :---- | :---- |
| Indemnity Level | 70% | 70% | 70% |
| Threshold Yield | 1,113 | 1,183 | 1,257 |

*Note1- Yield for each Crop to be notiﬁed in a district needs evaluation and check for its growth rate to set-up TYs for different years in a contract period. There may be a case that some crops in a district will have constant TY **(as shown in illustration II) and some stepped- up TY as shown in illustration III.***

*Note2- Please note that ﬁrst year TY (of a crop) needs to be calculated at IU level with data related to respective IUs. IInd and IIIrd year TY of different IUs need to be calculated with incorporation of TY growth rate as explained above.*

*Note3- Yield growth rate in preceding 7 years must be considered up to 2 decimal places.*

### **Premium Rate:**

It will remain same across the contract period like **Illustration I.**

### **Evaluation of tender process and determination of L1 Company:**

Under this method, every IC will quote the premium rate for each district crop combination notiﬁed by the State Governments/UT Administrations. L1 will be determined as the company having lowest weighted average rate considering last year insured areaas weight.

3. **Variable Threshold Yield \-** In this case, Threshold Yield of a crop in an IU may be computed every year after incorporating the actual crop yield of the previous year. For premium rate determination, increase/decrease in Threshold Yield will be determined by considering district level weighted average yield (assuming last year insured area as weight) of a crop. The premium rate shall be increased/ decreased as per mechanism detailed in the table below:

| responding Increase/ Decrease in APR against each 1% point Increase/Decrease in |  |  |  |
| ----- | ----- | :---: | :---: |
| **APR Grid** | **Indemnity Level** |  |  |
| **Premium Range** | **70%** | **80%** | **90%** |
| 0%\<=APR\<5% | 4.65% | 5.80% | 6.90% |
| 5%\<=APR\<10% | 2.80% | 3.45% | 4.15% |
| 10%\<=APR\<15% | 1.70% | 2.10% | 2.50% |
| 15%\<=APR\<20% | 1.20% | 1.50% | 1.75% |
| 20%\<=APR\<25% | 0.95% | 1.15% | 1.40% |
| 25%\<=APR\<30% | 0.75% | 0.95% | 1.15% |
| APR\>=30% | 0.65% | 0.80% | 0.95% |

   ### **In case of extreme circumstances wherein application of prescribed change in rates as above results in negative premium rate, the Central PMU will work out the rates. Worked-out rates after the approval of GoI will be acceptable to all concerned stakeholders.**

**Illustration 4: Variable TY Assumptions**  
District level weighted average yield (last year's area insured as weight) of a notiﬁed crop

| Year | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Yield | 1,500 | 1,700 | 1,600 | 1,800 | 1,850 | 1,400 | 1,500 |

### **Indemnity Level \=70%**

**Premium rate quoted by L1 Insurance Company for a district crop combination \=13%**

Year 2020 TY (Notional at district level) is calculated as per existing formula (using data given in 1st assumption) and TY for year 2021 and year 2022 are just assumed for illustration.

| Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---- |
| Threshold Yield | 1,183 | 1,225 | 1,155 |

### **Method**

Growth in District level Threshold Yield: Year 1: 0%

Year 2: 1,225 / 1,183 \- 1 \= 3.55%

Year 3: 1,155 / 1,183 \- 1 \= \-2.37%

*Note: In year 1 there would not be any change in TY as it will be known to insurance company during tender process.*

Variation in Premium Rate:

Year 1 \=13%

Year 2 \= 13%\*(1+(3.55\*1.7%)) \= 13.78%

Year 3 \= 13%\*(1+(-2.37\*1.7%)) \= 12.48%

*Note1 \- Please note that district level Threshold yield has been calculated notionally to calculate changes in Actuarial Premium Rate (as premium rates are quoted at district level) and have no other relevance.*

*Note2 \- Since premium rate is quoted for each district-crop combination, the above exercise needs to be performed for all the crops notiﬁed in a district.*

### **Evaluation of tender process and determination of L1 Company:**

Under this method, every insurance company will quote premium rate for each district-crop combination notiﬁed by State/UT Government. L1 will be determined as company having lowest weighted average rate considering last year’s area insured as weight.

### **Actual Premium Rate (APR)**

*Note1 \- Please note that the threshold yield may vary at IU level but for premium rate determination, weighted average yield (considering the last year insured area as weight) at the district level for respective crops will be considered.*

*Note2 \- These factors of increase/decrease have been ascertained independent of crop /region and reﬂect the country level impact due to changes in threshold yield. There may be different levels of impact on burn cost at the district/regional level due to variations in threshold yield, however, to simplify and considering the ease of implementation, it has been standardized.*

In this case the State/UTs would have to provide IU level crop yield data well in advance so that the revised Threshold Yield and premium rate could be calculated and notiﬁed before starting of the new season.

### **In case of unavailability of latest season yield data, the prior season yield data can be used for pricing, however, base Threshold Yield will not be allowed to be changed even if the latest data is made available post tender conclusion.**

While adopting any one of above three methods, the following assumptions and limitation of these methods may be taken note of**:**

1. Model using past data may not be a true reﬂection of future events.

2. Standardized rates prescribed above may not exactly reﬂect the risks inherent in speciﬁc district crop combination.

3. This model is subjected to spurious accuracy in certain cases.

4. Increase/ Decrease in threshold yield is being tested at the district level, but threshold yield can vary at the IU level and therefore have an element of approximation.

5. Increase/ Decrease in rates is calculated by the expected loss ratio of 80%.

6. As with all statistical/mathematical models, this method is also subject to modelling error.

7. Prescribed changes in premium rate are calculated considering mid-point of each APR range band except in 0-5% range wherein it is calculated at 4.5%.

8. This model assumes normality in yield data and therefore subject to an element of error in case of departure from normality.

   4. In exceptional cases, where the last corresponding season yield data is not available at the time of Bidding, yield data is to be provided before the harvesting of the current season. However, the yield data up to last-to-last corresponding season should be provided at the time of bidding itself. In such cases admissible claims will be anyway calculated on the basis of Average Yield and Threshold Yield values calculated on the basis of data available at the time of bidding.

   4. ## **Notiﬁcation of Sum Insured**

   The State/UTs need to choose either the Scale of Finance or Notional Average Value (Notional Average Yield X Minimum Selling Price (MSP) / Farm Gate Price) (Farm gate price will be considered for the other crops for which MSP is not declared) method for calculation of Sum Insured for a district-crop combination for the entire period of contract. The crop-wise sum insured notiﬁed in the ﬁrst year/season could be changed in the subsequent year/season as per the change in the Scale of ﬁnance or the MSP/ Farm gate price as available for the notiﬁed crop and decided upon by the State. However, change in the sum insured over a year due to the change in the Scale of Finance/farm gate price will be capped at 10% every year. In case of increase in Sum Insured beyond 10%, consent from the concerned Insurance Company and approval from GoI shall be mandatory to obtain.

   5. ## **Notiﬁcation of Seasonality Discipline**

   State/UTs in accordance with the broad seasonality deﬁned/prescribed in these Operational Guidelines shall also notify the seasonality discipline for various activities under the Scheme viz. submission of insurance proposals/application, consolidated declarations by banks, remittance of premium to Insurance Companies, uploading of individual covered farmer's data on NCIP, Tagging of applications as paid, Approval, Rejection or Reversion of applications by Insurance Companies, Re-submission of reverted applications by Insurance Intermediaries & CSC-VLEs etc., crop damage assessment for (i) standing crop (ii) localized calamities, (iii) prevented sowing, (iv) post-harvest losses, (v) On-Account payment for major calamities, conducting & monitoring of CCEs for crop yield estimation using mobile app, uploading of yield data on NCIP and settlement of claims by Insurance Companies using DigiClaim Module of NCIP etc., as per the provisions of the scheme guidelines.

   6. ## **Weather Information Network Data System (WINDS)**

      1. GoI intends to set up a nationwide network of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS)/Automatic Rain Gauges (ARG) under the WINDS initiative which shall augment the weather data collection system in the country in terms of adequacy of network, data collection, data standardization, data hosting and dissemination thorough coordinated efforts with IMD, State/UTs and Public/Private technical organizations.

      2. The GoI, constituted a committee for wider stakeholder consultations with a mandate to prepare a comprehensive document for nationwide implementation, standardization and improvement of weather data infrastructure, and development of WINDS Portal.

      3. Accordingly, the committee has prepared a comprehensive WINDS Manual 2023, which includes the Model Tender Document and the Agreement, in consultation with all the stakeholders comprising of representatives from India Meteorological Department (IMD), State Governments/UT Administrations, MoA\&FW Officials, Insurance Companies, Reinsurers, National & State Remote Sensing Application Centers and various technical agencies involved in providing weather data services across the country.

      4. The GoI has accordingly notified the WINDS Manual 2023 for its implementation and the same shall be followed by the State/UTs and other stakeholders for setting up AWS/ARGs under WINDS.

      5. WINDS shall facilitate the establishment of a full-fledged AWS at Block/Tehsil/Taluk level and ARG at Gram Panchayat (GP) level. This network shall foster development of “One Nation, One Pipeline” for hyper-local weather data for all purposes related to agriculture and disaster risk mitigation in the country.

      6. The State/UT shall establish the WINDS Network by calling tenders from the WINDS Implementation Partners (WIPs) empaneled by the WINDS committee for the purpose and shall notify the WINDS network as a source of certified weather data for settling claims under RWBCIS. Further the weather parameters shall be used for generating proxy indicators for applicable perils under PMFBY and for any other parameterized crop/disaster risk insurance schemes notified by the respective Central/State Governments/UT Administrations under SARTHI Platform framework. The weather data from this network shall also be used for the purpose of generating technology-based yield estimates as envisaged under YES-TECH Manual 2023\.

      7. Only those AWS/ARGs of IMD/State Governments/UT Administrations /private agencies should be considered and notiﬁed which are as per standards and specifications outlined in the WINDS Manual 2023, as amended from time to time. This network of AWS and ARGs shall be optimally operational and be able to provide real time weather data on WINDS Portal.

      8. The GoI, through WINDS Manual 2023, has envisaged to operationalize AWS/ARG network under WINDS with private player participation on the basis of **'renting of data'** i.e., final payment shall be linked to the data received at the WINDS portal, maintained by the GoI. Data generated at AWS/ARGs under WINDS shall be directly sent from data logger to the WINDS portal as per the data and information sharing policy defined in WINDS Manual 2023\.

      9. The State/UT shall notify the AWS and ARGs for consideration of weather data for generating the proxy indicators for initiating crop damage surveys under add-on claim and for assessing the extent of crop losses and computation of claims under RWBCIS. The weather data from WINDS will also be used for dispute resolution and calculation of synthetic yield data in case of failure to get applicable weighted component of Crop Yield estimation data arrived through CCEs for generating final yield data.

      10. The cost of implementing the WINDS component would be shared between Central and State Governments/UT Administrations on sunset basis as under:

|  SN |  Particulars | Sharing Ratio/Pattern between Central and State Governments/UT Administrations for YES-TECH |  |  |  |
| ----- | :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  |  | **2024-25 (1st Year)** | **2025-26 (2nd Year)** | **2026-27 (3rd Year)** | **2027 Onwards** |
|  1 | North-eastern and Himalayan States/UTs |  90:10 |  90:10 |  90:10 | As per premium sharing pattern between the Centre and the State Governments/UT Administrations |
| 2\. | Other States/UTs | 90:10 | 80:20 | 60:40 |  |

      11. The GoI and the State Governments/UT Administrations shall have the liberty to use the data generated under WINDS for public purposes, including but not limited to, implementation of welfare and development schemes, research and development, weather/agro-meteorological advisory, disaster management or for any other purpose involving larger public interest through Central/State/UT Government bodies or any other public institution including IMD, etc.

      12. The WINDS Implementation Partners (WIPs) can explore the commercial potential of the weather data generated through AWS/ARG network installed and maintained by them under WINDS. However, the WIPs shall not provide any data to any entity specifically restrained by the GoI. Further, data of stations/area notified by IMD or any other Government body as classified, shall also not be shared by the WIPs. The same shall be described in the data and information sharing policy of WINDS, to be notified separately by the WINDS Committee.

      13. The WINDS data shared by GoI with any entity shall not be used for any other purpose or shared with any third party or monetized by such entities.

      14. The weather data generated through AWS/ARG network under WINDS shall be hosted on an access-controlled WINDS portal and shall be shared with the concerned stakeholders, free of cost, as per the data and information sharing policy of WINDS, to be notified separately by the WINDS Committee.

8. # **Engagement of Common Service Centers (CSCs) and Other Intermediaries for Coverage of Non-Loanee Farmers**

   1. The CSC e-Gov India Ltd., a company established under Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeITY), has been engaged to enroll non-loanee farmers through their network of common service centers (CSCs) manned by Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) across almost all Gram Panchayats of the country. CSC e- Gov will act as a nodal agency for engagement with the GoI, the State

   Governments/UT Administrations and Insurance Companies for providing farmers’ enrollment and related services under PMFBY.

   2. All empaneled Insurance Companies shall compulsorily be required to enter into an agreement with CSC e-Gov for the enrolment of non-loanee farmers and for the provision of other related services to farmers under the purview of PMFBY and also pay service charges.

   3. All applications of one unique farmer of one village for a particular season and Scheme to be considered as one unit for the payment of service charges. No other agreement or payment is required to be made for this purpose. Transactions having identical Farmer’s ID with same village name and same CSC-ID will be considered as duplicate transaction. In such cases payment to CSC-e-Gov will be made only once. No service charge shall be payable on rejected applications. However, the Insurance Companies shall act on all such applications within 15 days from the finalization of enrollment data as per timelines mentioned in the seasonality discipline of Operational Guidelines.

   4. No charges/fee shall be borne or paid by the farmers being enrolled through CSC- VLEs, i.e., Common Service Centre \- Village Level Entrepreneur (CSC-VLE). This information should prominently be displayed by the concerned CSC-VLEs on their notice board, clearly visible by all visitors. State may take strict action including suitable proceeding under law against any CSC-VLE charging any fees from the farmers for enrolling them under the scheme.

   5. Any payment deducted from the wallet of CSC-VLE against the PMFBY/RWBCIS policies cannot be refunded without reconciliation of applications and corresponding data at NCIP and transaction statement generated by payment gateway provider. The amount received against the successful applications on NCIP will be transferred to the concerned Insurance Company the next day of the transaction (T+1). Difference between the amount received by CSC-eGov on day T and the amount pertaining to successful applications (day T) will be reconciled within next 7 days. Delay in remitting the aforesaid premium amount beyond 7 days will attract a penal interest as decided by the GoI based on the default period.

   6. While accepting the application from the individual farmers CSC-VLE will explainthe provisions and requirement of documents along with consequences of wrong submission of information/documents to the farmers and further take due care thatall the documents submitted by farmers are properly scrutinized, veriﬁed and uploaded on NCIP in legible form to avoid any anomaly in the coverage of that particular farmer by the Insurance Company. In order to avoid application rejection, the following approach/time-line shall be followed:

1. The insurance companies on finding any deficiency in the application during the quality check, shall revert the application with all observations in one go to the CSC- VLE within 15 days from the cut-off date for data entry by CSC-VLE on NCIP. Subsequent observations and reversion of already reverted and rectified applications shall not be allowed from NCIP.

2. The CSC-VLE shall immediately take action for the rectification of all the observations given by the concerned Insurer in one go within next 7 days and re- submit the applications back to the Insurance Companies.

3. In case VLE is not able to rectify or submit the revised documents they shall return

   such applications also within 7 days indicating their remarks.

4. Under no circumstances, the reverted applications shall be kept on hold and unresolved by the CSC-VLE after 7 days.

5. The insurance companies will have to finalize the status of the applications within the timeline stipulated in Table 2 of the **Para 16.4** indicating seasonality discipline. Insurance Companies shall not be able to revert again the application for any other fresh reason which was not given in first attempt and shall also not reject such application without prior approval of the State/UT Government and the GoI.

6. All rejected applications may be re-opened for review & verification if the State/UT Government and/or GoI decides to do so.

   7. As per the IRDAI circular, no separate qualiﬁcation/certiﬁcation will be required for the CSC-VLEs to facilitate enrolment of non-loanee farmers. However, proper training/ capacity building program should be arranged for them by the CSC e-Gov with support from concerned Insurance Companies and State Governments/UT Administrations.

   8. The Banking Correspondent (BC) associated with the designated branches of the rural ﬁnancial institutions including the public sector banks ﬁnancing KCC/Agriculture short-term loans at subsidized interest rate are also authorized to collect the applications/premium from the desirous non-loanee farmers, similarly to CSC-VLE, using the digital platform of the concerned banks or AIDE App for the same. Creation of login credential on the NCIP and approval of such eligible BCs should compulsorily be done by the branch head of the concerned bank branches. The activities including undertaking of business by such BCs are to be monitored by the bank branches and responsibility of irregularities if any will lie with the concerned bank. Other designated enrolment intermediaries may be empaneled and linked with the NCIP in due course as and when such new channels are approved by the GoI for the enrolment of farmers.

   9. Empaneled Insurance Companies have to necessarily register/approve all licensed insurance intermediaries desirous of getting engaged for enrolment of non-loanee farmers in the beginning of each season within 7 days of the award of work in the State/UT on NCIP and submit the list and details of such intermediaries to the concerned Nodal department of the State/UT Government. Further all intermediaries have to work strictly as per the provisions of the Scheme guidelines and IRDAI regulations.

9. # **Electronic Remittance of Funds**

   1. The GoI has already been leveraging the capabilities of Public Financial Management System (PFMS) for remittance of premium subsidies to concerned Insurance Companies and eligible claims directly into farmer’s Bank account, KCC or Saving Account or in Aadhaar linked bank accounts. Similarly, all the State Governments/UT Administrations shall also endeavor to utilize Public Financial Management System (PFMS)/PFMS linked systems to remit the funds to the Insurance Companies and other agencies under PMFBY to ensure transparency and authenticity in the financial transactions.

   2. Banks, CSC e-GOV and other Insurance intermediaries are required to remit the consolidated premium payment to respective Insurance Companies mandatorily

   through the Payment gateway of NCIP or payment challan generated through NCIP within the stipulated timelines. The remittance of the premium shall compulsorily be done within the cut-off date stipulated for the respective enrolment channels. Bank details of Insurance Companies have already been made available on the NCIP, the payment gateway and PFMS itself. The applicable service charges for remittance of premium amount through payment gateway shall be borne by the payer i.e. Banks, CSC e-Gov, Insurance Intermediaries, and Farmers enrolling themselves through NCIP. Presently, the payment gateway charges are Rs 5/- \+ applicable GST (i.e. Rs. 5.90/-) per transaction.

   3. To adjust the variance in the remitted premium due to rounding off by the banks and the Insurance intermediaries to the respective Insurance Companies through the payment gateway of the NCIP, no action is required if this amount is plus/minus Rs. 10/-. However, if the amount exceeds Rs. 10/- then the banks and the Insurance Intermediaries shall be allowed to remit a maximum amount of Rs. 100/- to the respective Insurance Companies through the payment gateway of the NCIP in order to cover the aforesaid shortfall, beyond the stipulated premium remittance cut-off date up to the cut-off date for application reconciliation.

   4. All Insurance Companies will maintain only one bank account for crop insurance business throughout the Country for premium credit including farmers’ share, state share and central share of subsidy from all concerned stakeholders. This amount will only be used for premium deposit purpose for PMFBY/RWBCIS and no other money can be credited to this account. The Insurance Companies will reconcile the account statement with the transaction statement issued by the payment gateway for premium remittance and PFMS/NCIP transaction statement for claim remittance and submit monthly declarations for each month regarding pendency of premium receipt and claim remittance along with the reasons thereof to the GoI. No remittance or ﬁnancial transaction in the form of Banker's cheque or Demand Draft or any other non-electronic mode shall be allowed.

   5. The Insurance Companies have been provided with login access of NCIP for sharing essential crop notiﬁcation data and information along with application-level coverage data including banking details of individual farmers on the NCIP, for doing the necessary data reconciliation, verification & validation, claim intimation, calculation of payable claims and remit the same directly into pre-declared bank accounts linked to the NCIP through PFMS.

   6. Insurance Companies shall complete all verification and validation of coverage details of farmers for the given season within the timelines as stipulated in the seasonality discipline of the operational guidelines mandatorily before the initiation of claim settlement. The Insurance Companies shall not be allowed to initiate separate verification process of any kind at the time of payment of claims and delay the claim settlement to the beneficiary farmers. As the requisite details such as Aadhaar number, land record and crop details, address etc. have been captured at the time of enrolment itself and accordingly Insurance Companies are expected to complete the verification within given timelines.

   7. Govt. of India is developing a Digital Public Infrastructure in the country to interconnect various digital databased spread across various States/UTs and other public & private entities across the country and globally also for leveraging various digital capabilities to increase the efficiency and service delivery across various

   farmer welfare schemes being run by the Central Govt. & State Governments/UT Administrations. One of these DPIs i.e. Agri-Stack which captures and maintains farmer registry, crop sown registry, and geo-referenced village maps. For effective and efficient management of PMFBY, the DA\&FW will rely on the data sharing mechanism or Agri-Stack. The relevant data pertinent to implementation of scheme shall be consumed electronically (using open API) for the purposes of beneficiary identification, verification, benefit delivery and monitoring, pertaining to the States. Districts, villages where these data are available. The information as and when collected and collated in the Farmers registry, land record validation, digital crop surveys, and geo-referenced village maps shall be used for implementation of this scheme.

   8. Going forward the verification and validation of coverage under the scheme shall be done using the pre-validated data of Farmer, Land Records & Crop details available through Agri-Stack. The data available from Agri-Stack shall have precedence on the data entered into NCIP by the enrollment channels. The acceptance of data coming from these platforms shall be binding on all stakeholders under the scheme and shall be considered for finalization of applications for insurance coverage. This shall come into force from the date of notification of Agri-Stack by Govt. of India. A detailed SOP with operational modalities including exception handling owing to difference between data entered on NCIP and validated data received from Agri- stack shall be notified by the GoI separately.

   9. Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) shall be used mandatorily as primary mode of payment of claims for the applications enrolled as non-loanee applications, whereas NEFT based remittance of claims shall be used as a primary mode for claim settlement for the applications enrolled for loanee farmers

10. # **Census Code Mapping of Entities**

    1. All State/UTs shall update census codes of their villages with the higher administrative/revenue units like Gram Panchayat, Firkas, Patwar Circles, Revenue Circles, Hoblis, Mandals, Blocks, Tehsils, Talukas, Districts as well as of Automatic Weather Stations/Backup Weather Stations. Only Revenue or LGD classiﬁcation of locations has been used in NCIP and accordingly the same shall be considered for creation and revision of location masters in NCIP. This will create a standard mechanism of mapping and identiﬁcation across the country.

    2. States/UTs are required to adopt the Revenue Hierarchical System under PMFBY and RWBCIS and accordingly shall update the village master to facilitate notiﬁcation on portal. The State/UTs shall ensure that the notiﬁcation of Hierarchical System should be same as that of the location master of revenue or LGD system to facilitate the uniform database for further reporting and analysis.

    3. GoI has procured village boundary maps from Survey of India. Further, for the purposes of obtaining updated and accurate farm location State/UTs must also provide Geo-coded (latitude & longitude) land parcel based cadastral maps and village shape maps in digital format for generation of SST points, setting up network of AWS and ARGs under WINDS, operationalization of YES-TECH and integration with other Apps like CCE Agri App, CROPIC App, AIDE App, Crop Loss Assessment App etc.

11. # **Digitization of Land Records**

    1. Under the Central Sector Scheme of Digital India Land Record Modernization Program (DILRMP), majority of the State/UTs have digitized their land records. To address the problems of over insurance and acreage discrepancy, State/UTs are strongly advised to integrate their digitized land records with the NCIP so that the individual land records of farmers can be accessed through the NCIP for crop insurance and the insured area be validated. This will help the Government to reach and identify individual beneﬁciaries and bring utmost transparency and authenticity in providing scheme benefits to the genuine beneficiaries as per their eligibility norms in the right spirits of provisions of the Operational Guidelines.

12. # **Sum Insured/Coverage Limit**

    1. States/UTs need to choose either the Scale of Finance or Notional Average Value (Notional Average Yield \* MSP/Farm Gate) price method for computation of Sum Insured for a district-crop combination for the entire period of the contract. The crop- wise sum insured notiﬁed in the ﬁrst year/season could be changed in the subsequent year/season as per the change in the Scale of ﬁnance or MSP/ Farm gate price as available for the notiﬁed crop and decided upon by the State. However, any change in the sum insured over a year due to changes in the scale of ﬁnance/farm gate price will be capped at 10% within the contract period. The sum Insured for individual farmer is equal to the Scale of ﬁnance or Notional Average Value (NAY x MSP/Farm Gate Price) per hectare multiplied by the insured area of the notiﬁed crop proposed by the farmer for insurance.

    2. Area under cultivation shall always be expressed in Hectare for all crops including perennial horticulture crops, accordingly the State Governments/UT Administrations are required to mandatorily notify the applicable premium and sum insured values at Per Hectare basis rather than per plant basis.

    3. In cases where crops are separately notiﬁed under irrigated, rainfed category bythe States/UTs, the Sum Insured value for irrigated and rainfed areas should be separately indicated and notified.

13. # **Premium Rates and Premium Subsidy**

    1. The Actuarial Premium Rate (APR) would be charged under PMFBY& RWBCIS by the implementing Insurance Company. The rate of premium payable by the farmer will be as per the following **Table 1**:

|  Season |  Crops | Maximum Premium Ratepayable by farmer (% of Sum Insured)\* |
| ----- | ----- | :---- |
|  Kharif | All Food grain and Oilseeds crops (all Cereals, Millets, Pulses and Oilseeds crops) | 2.0% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less |
|  Rabi | All Food grain and Oilseeds crops (all Cereals, Millets, Pulses and Oilseeds crops) | 1.5% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less |
|  Kharif and Rabi | Annual Commercial/ Annual Horticultural crops | 5% of SI or Actuarial rate, whichever is less |
|  | Perennial horticultural / commercial | 5% of SI or Actuarial rate, |

|  | crops (pilot basis) | whichever is less |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

*\*Note: Premium paid by non-loanee farmers should be rounded off to nearest Rupee.*

## **Payment of Government Subsidy**

All farmers enrolled under the scheme would be entitled for admissible subsidy onthe Actuarial Premium. All demands for premium subsidies shall be mandatorily routed through the NCIP by the Insurance Companies and paid through PFMS system by the GoI.

1. The difference between Actuarial Premium Rate (APR) and the Rate of Insurance premium payable by farmers shall be treated as the Rate of Normal Premium Subsidy, which shall be shared equally in 50:50 ratio by the Centre and State/UTs in all State/UTs except Himalayan & North Eastern Region (NER) State/UTs where subsidy sharing pattern between the Centre and State/UTs shall be in the 90:10 ratio.

   2. The full GoI share in the premium subsidy as per sharing pattern in **Para 13.1.1** above will be applicable only up to APR of 25% and 30% with respect to irrigated and rainfed areas/district, respectively. For APR beyond those rates, GoI share of subsidy will be limited to the applicable share up to the APR of 25% & 30% for each notified crops in irrigated and rainfed districts respectively. The applicability of APR for irrigated/unirrigated districts will be on the basis of the district-wise irrigated data submitted by the State/UT Government in the Tender Document and Notification. In case of the same is not submitted by the concerned State/UTs, the data published by Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES), DA\&FW as revised from time to time shall be used.

      3. For the purpose of categorization of Districts between Rainfed and Irrigated, districts having 50% or more of the Gross irrigated area will be categorized as Irrigated.

      4. The State/ UTs are free to extend additional subsidy to reduce the financial burden on farmers.

      5. 	share over and above the normal subsidy from their budget. In other words, additional subsidy, if any shall be borne entirely by the State/ UT. Subsidy in premium is allowed only to the extent of notiﬁed Sum Insured excluding the Sum Insured for the add-on covers for which GoI subsidy is not payable.

      6. The Government premium subsidy to the implementing Insurance Companies shall be routed through a Central Nodal Agency (CNA) designated by the GoI for the purpose, strictly as per the provisions of the Operational Guidelines and modalities prescribed by the GoI. Accordingly, the designated CNA is empowered to call and collect all requisite information related to implementation of the Scheme and utilization of Government funds and to share the same with the GoI for better planning, implementation and monitoring of the Scheme. The premium subsidy will be routed through PFMS/PFMS linked systems strictly based on the data hosed on NCIP for the concerned season/state & cluster.

      7. Governments, both Centre and State, shall release their share of subsidy as outlined in **Para 6.1.6** of these guidelines. The release of GoI subsidy shall not be dependent on release of State subsidy for all seasons covered under the scheme including past

   seasons. However, the Insurance Companies may continue to raise simultaneous demands for State/UT and GoI share for each State/UT and season separately.

      8. Both Centre and State Governments/UT Administrations, will release their share of advance subsidy (First Instalment) equivalent to 50% of respective share of subsidy in corresponding previous season to the Insurance Company if the demand is raised for the same by Insurance Company before the opening of NCIP for enrolments. In case the demand is submitted after the NCIP is opened for enrolments for the current season, the advance subsidy equivalent to 50% of respective share of subsidy as per paid applications for the current season shall be remitted subject to fulﬁlment of General Financial Rule (GFR)/guidelines in the matter without waiting for coverage details for the ongoing season. Subsequent tranches of subsidy share shall be released based on approved applications for the season subject to submission of demand for the same through NCIP. The Detailed process is given at **Para 6.1.7** of these guidelines.

      9. In the State/UT who have adopted full or preferential universalization by subsiding the Farmer share of premium also, the submission of demand for full farmer-share to be paid by the State/UT Government for the season shall also be mandatorily routed by the concerned insurance companies through NCIP on the basis of paid applications for the season and state.

      10. **To facilitate claim settlement under risks of Prevented Sowing/ Mid-Season Adversity/Localized Calamity:** Insurance Companies should release the admissible claim amount to the beneﬁciary immediately after receipt of farmers premium and advance subsidy (1st Instalment) and without waiting for release of ﬁnal subsidy (2nd Instalment) from Government. The total premium required in respect of affected IUs including subsidy to enable settlement of claims arising due to above events in respect of all such beneﬁciaries shall be adjusted from the fund already available with Insurance Companies as advance upfront subsidy (1st Instalment) to facilitate compliance with Section 64VB of Insurance Act/Regulation of IRDAI.

      11. All admissible claims based on Yield data/Post harvest losses will be settled on receipt of second instalment of Government subsidy to be paid on the basis of approved applications as available on the NCIP subject to submission of demand for the same by Insurance Companies through NCIP. The remaining Government subsidy, if any will be paid after reconciliation of all business statistics for the season on NCIP and only after the period speciﬁed for auto-approval of applications in the seasonality discipline outlines in the Operational Guidelines subject to submission of demand by the concerned Insurance Companies through the NCIP.

      12. All empaneled Insurance Companies including private Insurance Companies shall provide free access to the Central and State level agencies including Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) and its authorized agencies to verify the accounts and inspect the data and documents in respect to the implementation of PMFBY/RWBCIS.

      13. In case, the State/UT Government is willing to subsidize full farmers' share of premium, a token farmer Premium of minimum Re. 1 should compulsorily be charged per application from the farmer to facilitate electronic tracking, enrolment validations & reconciliation.

      14. Enrolment on the NCIP for any season shall be opened only after the conditions outlined in **Para 6.1.7** for submission of advance premium in Escrow accounts are fulfilled. However, the State/UTs shall not be allowed to implement the Scheme in subsequent seasons (at least two seasons) in case of considerable delay by State/UTs in release of requisite subsequent tranches of Premium Subsidy to concerned Insurance Companies beyond a prescribed time limit. Cut-off dates for invoking this provision for Kharif and Rabi seasons will be 31st March and 30th September of succeeding year respectively. However, State/UT shall have to pay a penalty @ interest rate of 12% per annum beyond three months of prescribed cut- off date for release of subsidy which shall be deposited in the Escrow Account maintained for the purpose.

14. # **Budget for Administrative Expenses**

    1. Up to 3% of the total budget for PMFBY/RWBCIS shall be mandatorily earmarked by State/UTs for creating funds for enabling administrative expenses towards implementation and monitoring of the Scheme including setting up of State PMUs, creating better implementation infrastructure, Monitoring and deployment of IEC & capacity building activities, expenditure towards yield estimation through CCEs & YES-TECH and crop health monitoring, crop damage/loss assessment expenses, setting up of AWS/ARGs under WINDS, adoption of new technologies and fostering innovation, travelling and creating contingency fund etc.

    2. The GoI has already made provisions for aforesaid activities under sub heads like Salaries, Domestic Travel Expenses, and Technology interventions, Ofﬁce Expenses, other Administrative Expenses and Professional Services etc., for Crop Insurance program under PMFBY/RWBCIS. State/UTs should make provisions and budgetary allocation on similar lines.

15. # **Central Program Management Unit (CPMU) & State Program Management Unit (SPMU)**

    1. Central Program Management Unit (CPMU) has been created at the Central level to provide technical support and professional advice on risk classiﬁcation & rating, research & development of new products, methodology for loss assessment including technology interventions, legal works, workshops for training & capacity building, along with the use of technology solutions including innovation, replication, digitization of administration of Schemes etc. through NCIP.

    2. CPMU shall calculate the Burn Cost (BC)/Loss Cost (LC) i.e., Claims as percentage (%) of Sum Insured (SI) observed in case of notiﬁed crop(s) in notiﬁed unit area of insurance during the preceding 10 similar crop seasons (Kharif/ Rabi) along with approximate APR of the crops proposed to be notiﬁed for the season. The loss cost/premium rate shall be provided exclusively to States/UTs on NCIP based on the latest available yield data uploaded by the State/UTs before invitation for premium bidding. The calculations provided on NCIP is only for reference purposes to have information on the approximate cost as per the underlying risk associated for providing insurance cover for the risks so as to enable the State Governments/UT Administration to evaluate the bids in proper perspective.

    3. CPMU shall also develop a suitable methodology for burn cost calculation, risk classiﬁcation & premium rating by using historical yield data, historical claim data

    including add-on claims, weather data, use and level of inputs viz. irrigation, technologies being used in crop cultivation & management, availability of remote sensing data & information about other parameters influencing crop growth and production etc., The CPMU shall also develop standardized methodology for risk analysis and premium rating for crop insurance, calculation of GoI liability towards premium subsidy and risk assessment and pricing methodology for insurance of other allied sectors and assets belonging to Agriculture & Rural economy of the country.

    4. In line with creation of CPMU at Central level and the experience gained over the last six successful years of implementation, it has been envisaged that all States/UTs implementing the Schemes should also create a separate State PMU at State Headquarter (HQ) level with sufﬁcient technical experts/staff. This will ensure continuity of manpower and creation of a resource pool ensuring better coordination between the Centre and the State/UTs leading to effective and successful implementation of the scheme at the ground level. SPMU may also opt for any additional members on contractual/temporary basis or take services of other organizations/research institutes etc., as per requirement. However, States shall have to allocate a separate budget for running the SPMU (refer **Para 14.1** above).

    5. The States/UTs shall be categorized for creation of SPMUs as per the table below and shall mandatorily onboard experts as detailed against their category. A minimum of one position against the indicated category of positions may be hired. In addition, the State/UT may hire additional positions as per their own requirement.

16. # **Seasonality Discipline**

    1. The cut-off date is uniform for both Loanee and non-loanee farmers. The District- wise cut-off dates for different crops shall be based on the Crop Calendar of major crops prepared in consultation with the concerned State Governments/UT Administrations/ICAR and crop division of DA\&FW which has also been published on NCIP ([www.pmfby.gov.in.).](http://www.pmfby.gov.in/) If any deviation is observed by the States/UTs from the aforesaid list, it may be brought to the notice of the DA\&FW for rectiﬁcation, if required. The SLCCCI, shall besides considering the prevailing agro-climatic conditions, rainfall distribution/ availability of water for irrigation, sowing pattern etc.

    ﬁx seasonality discipline of the coverage and other activities in such a way that it does not encourage adverse selection or moral hazards during the enrollment period. If the seasonality discipline as fixed by the SLCCCI is violated by States/UTs, GoI may decide not to provide applicable premium subsidy for the concerned season.

    2. The cut-off date for enrolment of each notiﬁed crop should be based on crop calendars of the districts and normally may not be beyond 15th July for Kharif, 15th December for Rabi & 15th Feb for summer seasons. The notiﬁed crops should mandatorily be categorized in three seasons Kharif, Rabi & Summer/Zaid crops depending on sowing period and the cut-off date for enrolment may also be ﬁxed accordingly.

    3. All State/UTs shall consider preponing the cut-off dates for Kharif and Rabi seasons. Advancement of cut-off may help in reduction of premium rates during the tendering years leading to reduction in ﬁnancial burden on the State/UTs and may also help in ample time duration for awareness generation and capacity building initiatives to encourage farmers to get enrolled under the scheme

5. In case the cut-off date for enrollment of farmers and debit of premium falls on a public holiday or is declared as a public holiday by the Central or State/UT Government or there is disruption of services due to strikes or shut-down or any kind of calamity or catastrophic event etc., the next working day shall be treated as the cut-off date for enrollment and debit of premium. Concerned State/UTs have to take timely action and decision in this regard and send a formal intimation to the GoI for requisite rectiﬁcation on NCIP. The subsequent Cut-off dates for each activity pertaining to actions on finalization of enrollment data shall be deemed to be shifted by the number of days the cut-off date is shifted.

   6. In case of disruption of services due to natural events beyond human control or technical or software or network related issues with the NCIP the subsequent dates may be extended by the competent authority of Government of India on the basis of speciﬁc written inputs from NCIP team. However, due care has to be taken that such extension does not lead to a moral hazard and misuse of the Scheme and suitable measures should be put forth for the same accordingly.

   7. Further, in case of more than two major crop season(s) pattern in any specific States/UTs, a modiﬁed seasonality discipline keeping in view the overall seasonality discipline prescribed above, shall be approved and adopted by SLCCCI.

   8. ### **Keeping in view the speciﬁc nature of crop and scope for catastrophic crop damage, SLCCCI shall ﬁx seasonality discipline in such a way that it does not encourage adverse selection or moral hazards and also ensures timely payment of claims to eligible insured farmers. Scheme also has provisionsfor claims due to prevented sowing and option to change the insured crop,hence, the State Governments/UT Administrations will take all necessary steps to ensure enrolment of farmers well within the stipulated time under the Scheme**. No request/relaxation for the extension in the above seasonality/cut-off dates shall be

   considered/ granted by the GoI once it is ﬁxed and notiﬁed for the crop season. However, preponement in cut-off dates shall be considered on a case-to-case basis. If any State/ UT extends the above seasonality/cut-off dates on its-own without approval of the GoI, the GoI share of premium subsidy shall not be provided for the concerned notiﬁed crops /areas.

   9. ### **It may be noted that, under no circumstance, will GoI or any State/UT extend the cut-off dates for enrolment of farmers except for the Para 16.6. However, in case the States/UTs decide to do so, it may be done only in agreement with implementing Insurance Company. The State/UT shall mandatorily obtain the consent of the implementing Insurance Company and submit the same to the GoI along with the cut-off date extension request. In such cases, however no central premium subsidy will be provided for the areas & crops which are covered/insured during the extended period and the concerned State/UT has to bear the entire subsidy liability for the said coverage.**

   10. There may be exceptional circumstances or technical glitches due to which farmers’ data could not be uploaded on NCIP, however, the corresponding premium was remitted to the concerned insurance companies within the given cut-off-date, the State Govt./UT may request GoI for a special window to enter such data on NCIP beyond normal window for data entry as per seasonality discipline. GoI, based on the facts submitted shall review the matter and may allow a special window for data entry. GoI may ask the State Govt. to furnish the consent of concerned Insurance Company, if the same is felt necessary.

   11. Similarly, due to technical glitches, premium remittance gets failed despite attempts made by the stakeholders to remit the same within cut-off date. In this case State Govt./UT may request GoI for a special window to re-attempt remittance of premium through NCIP beyond normal window for premium remittance as per seasonality discipline. GoI upon examination, may allow a special window for challan creation and enabling premium remittances through NCIP. The challans for such cases shall be made by the concerned Insurance Company upon due validation and shall be shared with the concerned stakeholder for re-initiating the payments.

   12. In case CCE data submitted through CCE Agri App is not approved within the stipulated timelines, the same will be approved automatically and used for claim calculation. In case of non-submission of Actual Yield data by the State/UT Government to implementing Insurance Companies or failure of the State/UT to upload and approve the same on NCIP within stipulated timelines, Synthetic Yield data arrived using Technology Based Solutions and having 100% weightage shall be used for calculation of admissible claims and subsequent settlement of claims to the eligible farmers. The cut-off date for submission of yield data to Insurance Companies is normally one month after the completion of harvesting of a particular crop.

   13. In a situation where total claims have been approved or auto approved, the Insurance Companies shall be liable to pay claims within 3 weeks of calculation/auto-approval of claims irrespective of whether Insurance Companies have raised the demand for 2nd tranche of premium subsidy or not. Also, the Insurance Company shall not put the claim settlement on hold due to ongoing or pending KYC or crop-land area verification as the same is expected to be completed before the initiation of final claims for the season. Further, it is advised that Insurance Company raises the demand for 2nd tranche of premium subsidy within the given

   timelines. If the release of 2nd tranche is pending on account of non-submission of demand for claiming the said amount by the Insurance Companies, the timelines of payment of claims shall be counted from prescribed date of approval of claim data (AY-TY or Loss %age) and not from date of actual payment of 2nd tranche of subsidy.

   14. All types of admissible claims shall mandatorily be paid within the stipulated cut-off date failing which penal interest @ 12% per annum shall be payable to the farmers on admissible pending claims beyond stipulated timelines for various kinds of localized and area approach add-on claims including the final yield claims. subject to release of applicable subsidy premium by the State Governments/UT Administrations. **This mechanism shall be mandatorily applicable from Kharif 2024 onwards.** In case the State/UT subsidy share is not released within the stipulated cut-off date then the Insurance Companies shall release the claims on pro-rata basis against the premium received. The penal interest as above shall also be applicable on delay of claim settlement for the liability of State Governments/UT Administrations in case of “Cup & Cap” models under alternate risk management mechanism.

   15. Since the yield data is being ﬁnalized by the State Government/UT Administrations and uploaded on NCIP, the admissible penal interest rate shall be calculated on the NCIP and the same shall be added to the payable claims of eligible farmers through DigiClaim module of NCIP. Non-Compliance by the Insurance Companies shall lead to further administrative action by the GoI.

17. # **Collection of Applications and Premium from Farmers**

    1. The branches of all scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks, and cooperative banks shall act as nodal branches for enrolment of farmers in the NCIP. The primary agriculture credit societies (PACS) attached with cooperative bank branches will enroll the farmers through concerned branches of the cooperative bank. The concerned Lead bank and Regional ofﬁces/ Administrative ofﬁces of Commercial banks/RRBs will provide necessary guidelines to the concerned bank branches and coordinate with them to ensure that all concerned branches compulsorily generate the payment challan and remit the consolidated farmers premium electronically/online through payment gateway on NCIP to the concerned Insurance Companies and enter the details of applications on NCIP within the stipulated cut-off dates for uploading the application level data on NCIP. Besides, for the coverage of non-loanee farmers, Insurance Companies may also use IRDAI approved insurance intermediaries. The details of such intermediaries including in- house and outsourced manpower and infrastructure deployed for the enrolment and providing other services to the insured farmers under the scheme should compulsorily be submitted to the State Governments/UT Administrations and the GoI and updated/approved on NCIP well before the start of the season. The Insurance Companies shall register/approve the Insurance Intermediaries on NCIP and create login credentials for the same in order to enable them for enrollment of individual insured/covered farmers on NCIP using digital platform viz. AIDE App. Alternatively, the Insurance Intermediaries can self-register on NCIP and declare their willingness enroll non-loanee farmers under the scheme.

    2. All the Banks are required to upload the insured farmers' data mandatorily on the NCIP using the fully automated mode of data entry using API integration between CBS/middleware utility and NCIP or by manually entering the data for each application through web-portal. No other platform shall be used for uploading or

    submission of enrolled applications to insurance companies. Those farmers whose data is uploaded on the NCIP shall only be eligible for Insurance coverage and accordingly the premium subsidy will also be released by the State/UT and Central Govt. basis the data availability on NCIP. **In cases where farmers are denied crop insurance due to incorrect or partial data entry or non-uploading of their details on NCIP, the concerned Banks, their Branches and Intermediaries shall be responsible for payment of eligible claims to the affected farmers (If any)**.

    3. In order to facilitate timely release of Government subsidy and remittance of claims to the farmers, entry of detailed information of all insured farmers on NCIP is mandatory for all bank branches/PACS/ BCs/CSCs/ Intermediaries/Designated Insurance Agents and Insurance Companies.

    4. Farmer for a specific parcel of land will be allowed to enroll themselves from one channel of enrolment only (Banks, CSC, Insurance Intermediaries, Insurance Company or directly by the Farmers using Web-portal or Mobile Application etc.) for the notiﬁed crops. If the farmer is having multiple crops on that parcel of land then also he/she shall enroll his/her desired crops through same channel of enrollment. The Enrollment channels shall also submit single application for mixed crops and mention proportionate area of that parcel under each crop in the web-portal or other digital platform viz. AIDE App.

    5. IRDAI is in process of developing a women centric rural distribution channel named as Bima Vahak. The channel shall also be made operational for enrollment of farmers under PMFBY as and when the same is established & notified.

    6. ## **Loanee Farmers:**

       1. **Whenever banks sanction crop loan/KCC for the notiﬁed crop in a notiﬁed area for the given season, the crop loan amount to the extent of notiﬁed Sum Insured for notiﬁed crop and acreage of individual notiﬁed crop of loanee farmers shall be taken into consideration for coverage, provided that the farmers have not submitted their choice to opt out from the scheme by a way of self-declaration for that particular season, as per seasonality discipline.** Based on seasonality of crop, banks should separately calculate the eligibility of loan amount for coverage during both Kharif and Rabi seasons based on the notified Sum Insured and declared acreage under notiﬁed crops as mentioned in the KCC Loan documents or subsequently submitted by the farmer based on their changed cropping pattern. KCC Loan disbursing bank branch/PACS shall prepare and update the statement of crop-wise and insurance unit-wise details of eligible and non-opted out farmers for crop insurance with applicable farmer’s share of premium to be debited from the respective KCC Accounts and initiate premium remittance to the concerned Insurance Companies as per the timelines outlined in the seasonality. **If required, the loan disbursing bank branches/PACS shall ﬁnance additional loan amount equal to the premium amount payable by farmer for getting enrolled under the scheme in case the available limit under the KCC Loan has been fully exhausted at the time of enrollment period.**

       2. For insurance coverage of a farmer, Sum Insured value for a notiﬁed crop and season shall be notiﬁed and digitized on the NCIP by the State/UTs within given timelines. The cut-off date for enrollment shall solely be based on the dates notified by the States/UTs and digitized on NCIP for the notiﬁed crops & season and shall

    be independent of actual date of disbursement/withdrawal of full or part KCC loan. Farmers having KCC loans for Kharif & Rabi crops with renewal dates falling after cut-off date for enrollment and debit of premium (renew/sanction period) for the season shall also be eligible for enrollment under the scheme for the same crop season subject to the prevailing loan being standard loan and debiting of applicable premium within the cut-off dates as outlined in the seasonality Discipline or Digitized on NCIP by the States/UTs. In order to eliminate excess insurance and rationalize government subsidy, utmost care shall be taken to ensure that only correct acreage under each notified crop as per KCC loan application or subsequently declared by the farmer based on his/her changed cropping practice is considered for coverage of notiﬁed crop and not the overall total acreage. Bank Branches and PACS shall be liable for inspection/verification/validation by the GoI/State/UT or agencies designated by them to verify and validate instances of excess insurance or potential misappropriation of government funds.

       3. All enrolment agencies including cooperative banks and PACS shall provide valid and fully operational bank account details of farmers viz. complete bank account number, Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) to enable direct transfer of claims into the farmers account. The bank account should be able to receive credit directly through electronic remittance. The non-computerized and non-CBS PACS who maintain a non-compliant serialized loan identification number of borrowers shall mandatorily enter Saving Bank Account of the loan account holder maintained at the concerned District Central Cooperative Bank for the purpose. In absence of correct and operational account number on NCIP, the claims for the eligible farmers shall be initiated through Aadhaar Based Payment System (AEPS) into Aadhaar ceded bank account number. The concerned banks shall not raise any objection to the process in case of their failure to provide the correct and DBT compliant bank account number.

       4. Any reporting of excess acreages under insurance in comparison to the sown acreage will be liable for initiation of documentary and physical inspection/verification/validation by the GoI/State/UT or agencies designated by them and lead to administrative action if gross negligence and malpractice in reporting of insurance acreage is found at farmer's or enrolment channel's end.

       5. Beneﬁt of add on products viz., Prevented sowing/ On-Account Payment for Mid- season Adversity/ Localized Calamity shall be available to only those farmers who have paid the premium or the premium has been debited from their account before the peril occurrence notification by the State Governments/UT Administrations for invoking this provision for compensation. Hence, Banks must ensure that they debit farmers premium immediately after the cut-off date of opting out of loanee farmers, failing which banks will be liable to meet the claim liabilities of uncovered eligible farmers.

       6. Detailed example for Calculation of crop-wise Sum Insured (SI) for the season for coverage of loanee farmers is given in Table 3 below:

***\*Note:** The Area which has been left out of coverage as loanee farmer for the notiﬁed crop can be insured by the farmer as a non-loanee farmer by depositing additional applicable premium along with required relevant documents.*

7. Farmers having crop loans sanctioned through Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) are covered as loanee farmer and banks shall maintain all back up records and registers relating to compliance with the seasonality discipline for debiting and remittance of farmers premium on or before the respective cut-off-date and the cut-off dates for submission of coverage details on NCIP. Bank branch shall apportion coverage area among insurable crops, based on acreage mentioned in loan application or on the

   basis of actual area sown as declared by the farmer subsequently but prior to the cut-off-date for debit of farmers premium and enrollment of farmers under the scheme.

   8. Bank Branches of Commercial Banks (CBs) and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)/ Nodal Bank Branch in case of PACS under its jurisdiction shall submit individual insured farmer's application details along with the challan number details of premium remittance through NCIP.

      9. Different options for entry of details of enrolled farmers on NCIP are available for bank branches in a more transparent and efficient manner. Banks can upload the details of insured farmers through online web-application mode. Banks arerequired to enter the information continuously without waiting for last day for premium debit and data entry.

      10. As an alternative, direct integration of Core Banking Solution (CBS) or middleware utility with NCIP using API based data exchange protocols has also been successfully initiated and the same may be used by Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs)/RRBs/District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) available on CBS for pushing the farmers' details in bulk directly without ﬁlling the individual farmer's details on web-portal.

      11. The scheme will work on the **"Opt-out"** mode for the existing loanee farmers. The farmers can choose not to be enrolled under the Scheme by giving a signed declaration as per prescribed format (**Annexure-VI**) specifying the season and mentioning their unwillingness to participate in the scheme any time during the year for the upcoming/ongoing season but atleast 7 days before the cut-off date for enrolment and debiting of farmers premium. The opt-out mechanism so adopted shall only be applicable for one season-year only; for which the opt-out declaration has been given by the farmer. Farmers can use available communication mediums for communicating their willingness for "opt-out" to their respective bank branches, however, they will ensure that their willingness is received and recorded by the bank within the aforesaid prescribed period. No bank branch shall forcefully make the farmers to opt-out from the scheme. Any such complaint received from the farmers shall be dealt with stringent action by GoI. **Bank branches shall maintain and store such declarations submitted by the farmers for inspection/verification/validation by the GoI/State/UT or agencies designated by them.**

      12. Banks need to debit farmer's share of premium within the last 7 days up to enrolment cut-off date. During this period, the banks may also prepare the ﬁnal list of farmers who have opted-out and all eligible loanee farmers to be covered under the scheme.

      13. In case the farmer has submitted a declaration for opting-out from the scheme for a season earlier in previous year he will be enrolled automatically for the current season by the bank branch as a normal process without any requirement for the farmer to submit written or oral consent for the purpose unless the farmer himself has submitted opt-out form for the current season as well.

      14. Declaration for "Opting-out" will have to be submitted by the farmer in the same bank branch where they have their KCC Loan account. Formats for "Opting-out" are already circulated to relevant stakeholders and is annexed at **Annexure-VI** of these

   guidelines for reference.

      15. Banks shall ensure mandatory enrolment of all those loanee farmers who have indicated their willingness to enroll by not submitted declarations for Opting-out up to 7 days before the cut-off date, for enrolment and debiting of farmers premium. **In case of failure of entry of data of eligible and willing farmers leading to farmers being left without insurance cover, the liability for all such applications and farmers shall rest with the concerned bank branches and accordingly they shall make the eligible claim payment to the concerned farmers.**

      16. In cases where the farmer's application has been rejected by the Insurance Company as per the provisions of Operational Guidelines, farmer's remittance for such applications must be refunded back to the farmer's bank account within 45 days of closure of cut-off date for uploading of data by Banks, PACS etc., failing which the Insurance Company will be constrained to accept the application and pay claims as per normal process.

      17. All rejected applications may be re-opened for review & verification purpose if the State/UT Government and/or GoI decides to do so.

   7. ## **Non-Loanee Farmers through Banks and other Channel Partners**

      4. In case of application submitted through CSC-VLE, the CSC-VLE shall authenticate the farmer using their biometric authentication using Aadhaar services made available by UIDAI for ﬁlling up the online application. Having a bank account is essential for such cases. In this case, CSC-VLE will upload all requisite and desired supporting documents on NCIP while ﬁlling up the application form on behalf of the farmer. Applications without requisite documents would not be considered for insurance coverage and CSC-VLE themselves shall be responsible for proper ﬁlling

   of application form to ensure the farmer is enrolled under the scheme to receive the intended benefits.

      5. CSC/Bank Branch/PACS/designated BCs ofﬁcials will assist the farmers in completing the insurance application and provide necessary guidance. While accepting the applications and premium, CSC/Bank Branch/PACS/BCs will be responsible for veriﬁcation of required documents, eligible sum insured, applicable premium rate, etc. In case of coverage through non-computerized PACS, they will consolidate these particulars and send them directly to respective Nodal Bank Branches/DCCBs which will, in turn, submit application details online on NCIP and generate crop wise challan electronically on the NCIP, for the e-remittance of consolidated premium through challan using payment gateway of NCIP to concerned Insurance Companies within the stipulated timelines as outlined in Operational Guidelines of digitized on NCIP. Besides CSC-VLEs, other Government/Semi-Government institutions and organizations proposed to be utilized for insurance of non-loanee farmers after their integration with the NCIP shall be done by DA\&FW, GoI after obtaining due administrative approvals.

      6. Non-loanee farmers could also be serviced directly by any designated agencies, duly authorized by the GoI, or insurance intermediaries licensed by the IRDAI for the purpose and they will act as a guide and facilitator wherein they will advise such non loanee farmers about the beneﬁts and desirability of the Scheme and guide the farmers about procedures involved, collect requisite premium and remit individual/ consolidated premium electronically to Insurance Companies and upload details of each insured farmer compulsorily within stipulated timelines on the NCIP using digital platforms like NCIP or AIDE App mandatorily.

      7. While accepting the applications and the premium from aforesaid designated insurance intermediaries, it shall be the responsibility of Insurance Companies or its designated intermediaries to verify insurable interest and collect the land records, Aadhaar Number, particulars of acreage, sum insured, crop sown details etc. and applicable contract/agreement details in case of sharecroppers or tenant farmer. The designated intermediaries shall enter the data of farmers on web-portal or other digital platform viz. AIDE App, remit the premium within 2 days to Insurance Companies. However, it is mandatory that the non-loanee farmers serviced by the designated intermediaries should hold a bank account and Aadhaar Number or Aadhaar Enrolment Number in order to get insured and the designated intermediaries will also facilitate in providing other services and insurance of other assets and crops under SARTHI Platform.

      8.

      9. All rejected applications may be re-opened for review & verification purpose if the State/UT Government and/or GoI decides to do so.

      10. For farmers buying crop insurance through CSC-VLEs or online, OTP/Aadhaar enabled veriﬁcation shall be construed as consent and signature of the applicant for availing coverage under the scheme.

   8. ## **Non-Loanee Farmers \- Directly to Insurance Companies or through Web Portal**

      1. Non-Loanee farmer may contact the Insurance Company and submit the requisite and desired supporting documents and applicable premium through conventional method or through electronic mode.

      2. Non-loanee farmer can also submit application forms for getting insurance coverage through NCIP or Crop Insurance App. For this, a farmer can ﬁll up the online application form available on NCIP ([www.pmfby.gov.in)](http://www.pmfby.gov.in/) or Crop Insurance App and pay the requisite premium electronically through the payment gateway. As soon as the application is submitted through the system, an acknowledgement receipt will be generated along with a unique application number. Additionally, intimation will also be sent through SMS on registered mobile number of the farmer. In this case, farmers themselves will upload all requisite and desired supporting documents on web-portal or mobile app while ﬁlling up the application form. Applications without requisite documents would not be considered for insurance coverage and farmers themselves shall be responsible for proper ﬁlling of application form to ensure that they are enrolled under the scheme to receive the intended benefits.

      3. It is mandatory that Non-Loanee farmers, willing to enroll themselves under the scheme shall have insurable interest and submit necessary documentary evidence as proof to confirm the same. SLCCCI may decide the documentary proofs to be mandated for submission along with Aadhaar Number or Aadhaar Enrolment Number. The insured farmer will lose the premium and the right to claim (if any) if the material facts furnished in the application are found to be wrong or incorrect at any stage from enrollment till claim settlement. Such farmers shall be liable to return the claim even if already paid if the same is demanded by the States/UTs upon finding and validation of any wrong or incorrect information.

      4. Insurance Company retains the right to accept or reject applications under the scheme within 15 days and 30 days after the cut-off date for data entry on NCIP for Loanee and Non-Loanee farmers respectively by the concerned enrollment channels.

   9. ## **Option for change of crop name by the Farmer**

      1. All loanee farmers can change the name of the insured crop from the original crop indicated in the KCC loan application but such change should be submitted in writing

   to the concerned bank branch up to 2 working days before the cut-off date for enrolment and accordingly their newly proposed crops should be insured provided that the new crop is also notified under the scheme by the State/UT. Bank will ensure that all standard loans (as deﬁned by concerned FIs) sanctioned and renewed for notiﬁed crops within stipulated cut-off date should be covered if the farmers has not opted-out upto 7 days before cut-off dates for enrolment and debiting of farmers premium. In case the premium debited earlier was higher, concerned Bank branch or Insurance Company shall credit or refund the excess premium as the case may be to farmer's account.

   15. All Insurance Companies shall compulsorily verify and take necessary action including approval, rejection or reversion of applications of farmers through NCIP within stipulated date. After stipulated period for reconciliation & obtaining further clarifications from the concerned channels of enrolments, all pending applications of covered farmers uploaded on NCIP shall be treated as deemed approved and the Insurance Companies will lose their right for any further veriﬁcation and validation of such applications. However, any losses to the Government including excess payment of premium subsidy due to delayed/non-veriﬁcation of application data of individual covered farmers as available on NCIP will be recovered from concerned Insurance Companies only and suitable administrative action may also be taken

   against the defaulting Insurance Companies.

   16. The Insurance Companies are mandatorily required to follow the process and protocol for processing of application, inception of risk and processing of claims as detailed in the Operational Guidelines and revise or correct the applications if:

       1. The KCC Loan was covered or premium was paid outside seasonality discipline.

Further, the banks can download acknowledgement receipt from NCIP using their login credentials and may handover Acknowledgement Receipt to each insured loanee farmer within 7 days from the acceptance of applications by the concerned Insurance Company. Similarly, the CSC-VLEs and Insurance Intermediaries can also download the Acknowledgement Receipt from AIDE and/or NCIP and handover/share to the farmer at the time of enrollment.

   19. All the Insurance Companies shall ensure distribution of the acknowledgement receipts through conventional/electronic mode to the loanee farmers in the template approved by the GoI within a month of cut-off date for uploading of data pertaining to farmers’ applications on NCIP.

    1. **Wide-Spread Calamities (based on season-end yield):** The eligible claims on the basis of crop yield estimation data arrived through CCEs or by using values arrived through CCE and YES-TECH in a pre-defined proportional ratio will be considered only if notiﬁed trigger of Threshold Yield is breached (Refer **Para 20.2**). The State Governments/UTs should mandatorily conduct CCEs using either their own Mobile App or through CCE Agri APP or unified App (under GCES) which has been developed by GoI. The yield estimation data from State’s own Mobile App or CCE- Agri App shall be shared through APIs to NCIP and other digital platforms of GoI and State Govts./UTs wherever required for the purpose of crop yield estimation & triangulation of yield data for validation and production estimates. The State Governments/ UT nodal department shall share the final crop yield values (AY values) obtained through the CCEs/Mobile App with all concerned Insurance Companies in hard or soft copy to enable them to accept the same on DigiClaim module of NCIP for the claim calculation and payment.

    2. The Scheme operates on the basis of **'Area Approach'**. The Deﬁned Areas for each notiﬁed crop for wide-spread calamities, i.e., the insurance unit is the Village/Village Panchayat or any other equivalent unit for major crops and for other crops it may be the same unit or a unit of a size higher than Village/ Village Panchayat level and shall be decided by the SLCCCI in the respective States/UTs. Claims for widespread crop losses on the basis of "Area Approach" will be decided by regular crop yield estimation surveys or by adopting the Smart Sampling Methodology for crop yield estimation and/or yield estimation through technology under YES-TECH. Department overseeing the conduct of CCEs will submit crop yield estimation data as per the cut-off date decided by SLCCCI, along with results of individual CCEs (conducted using CCE Agri App) on NCIP. The yield data will be approved by the concerned district authorities on NCIP. Final crop yield values shall also be shared by the State/UT nodal department with all concerned Insurance Companies to enable them to accept the same on specially developed module for the purpose on NCIP.

    3. CCEs shall be undertaken per crop per unit area of insurance for notiﬁed crops\*, on a sliding scale, as indicated in Table 4 below:

| Sl. No. | Level | Minimum Sample Size |
| :---: | :---- | :---: |
| 1 | District | 24 |
| 2 | Taluka/Tehsil/Block | 16 |
| 3 | Mandal/Firka/Revenue Circle/Hobli or anyother equivalent unit | 10 |
| 4 | Village/Village Panchayat | 4 |

    *\*Note: Minor crops may be notiﬁed at higher than Village/Village Panchayat level.*

    4. ## **Smart Sampling Methodology for Crop Yield Estimation**

    For major crops across states and with availability of technologies, the following method of Rationalization of number of CCEs without impacting the quality of sampling and estimation results will be adopted.

       1. **Smart Sampling of CCEs:** Technology solutions for rationalization of CCEs basedon homogeneous selection of sample experimental plots based on crop health condition analyzed through Remote Sensing and other New Age technological

    solutions shall be used for rationalization of number of CCEs. For more details, refer to

    **Para 20.1**.

    5. ## **Modalities for Conducting Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs)**

       1. In order to maintain the sanctity and credibility of CCEs as an objective method of crop yield estimation, the modalities mentioned below will be followed:

1. To bring transparency and confidence in the data, State Governments/ UTs shall mandatorily ensure that all the CCEs are conducted through a CCE Agri App developed by GoI for the purpose of digitizing the process of crop yield estimation & collation of yield data obtained through CCEs. The yield estimation data from State’s own Mobile App or CCE-Agri App shall be shared through APIs to NCIP and other digital platforms of GoI and State Govts./UTs wherever required for the purpose of crop yield estimation. State/ UTs shall ensure that their Mobile Apps have all the features, validations and specifications as maintained in CCE Agri App for the purpose.

2. Further, in order to encourage the primary workers of the State Governments/UT Administrations to use mobile App for conducting the CCEs, the GoI shall provide incentives to promote 100% usage of CCE Agri App. Every Primary Worker or Field functionary conducting CCEs through CCE Agri-App shall be entitled for receiving Rs.150/- per CCE as the cost towards promotion of technology which shall be given by GoI, after the approval of the individual CCEs by the respective State Administration.

3. Where the State Governments/UT Administrations are also willing to pay any amount to their workers from their resources, the same shall be over and above the amount paid by GoI.

4. The existing system of incentivization in the form of reimbursement for the purchase of smart phone, data charges, and expenses on outsourcing of CCEs shall be discontinued with the onboarding of new system of incentivizing the primary worker upfront, however, past liabilities shall be settled.

   *(Note: **Para 18.4.1** shall come into effect from the date of issue of specific SOP/Guidelines in this regard)*

   2. If the State/UTs do not conduct their Crop Cutting Experiments through the CCE- Agri app, then additional weightage shall be assigned to the technology derived yield estimates, as defined in **Para 20.3.2 i.e., Yield Estimation System Based on technology (YES-TECH)**, of these guidelines.

      3. CCE experimental plots shall be chosen using smart sampling technology for selected major crops and conventional random sampling for other crops and the **secrecy of the selected plot, subject to disclosure to relevant stakeholders under these Guidelines, should be maintained by all concerned until the CCE is actually conducted in order to rule out potential moral hazards**. States/UTs may continue to estimate the crop yield by adopting General Crop Estimation Survey (GCES) for estimation of crop production, as recommended by Department of Economics & Statistics, GoI. However, the States/ UTs shall keep the CCEs to be conducted under General Crop Estimation Survey (GCES) separate from CCEs conducted under PMFBY and accordingly prepare separate plan for CCEs to be conducted under GCES and CCEs to be conducted under PMFBY.

      4. In case few experiments under GCES also falls in the IUs under PMFBY, the results of such experiments shall be accepted for use under crop yield estimation for the scheme and therefore only balance CCEs shall be conducted under the scheme for arriving at estimated yield value for the crop in given IU provided that the sampling methodology for selection of experimental plots under PMFBY is also based on random sampling.

      5. In case of sampling methodology being SST, complete CCEs as required for the given IU shall be conducted using the SST method only. In other words, in a particular insurance unit, all the requisite experimental field plots for conducting CCEs shall either be selected using SST or using Random Number Sampling Method to avoid sampling error.

      6. 	A comprehensive manual for Crop Cutting Experiments for Crop Yield Estimation has also been developed by the GoI in consultation with NSSO, IASRI and the respective State Governments/UT Administrations.

      7. The GoI shall notify the CCE Manual 2023 and the same shall be followed by the States/UTs for conducting CCEs under PMFBY.

      8. In order to provide proper beneﬁts to the farmers and to compensate them as per near actual loss experience, crop(s) shall be notiﬁed at the lowest level i.e. Village/Village Panchayat as detailed in **Para 18.2.**

      9. State/UTs shall strengthen the audit process of the conduct of CCEs, with necessary checks and balances. Digitizing the CCE process including geo-coding (providing the latitude and longitude of the CCE location), date/ time- stamping and taking photographs (of the CCE plot and CCE activity), is a must for all CCEs being conducted.

      10. Wherever external agencies are proposed to be used by the State Governments/UT Administrations for conduct of CCEs (i.e. CCEs are outsourced), it should be given only to the registered 'professional/accredited' agencies with adequate experience in the agricultural ﬁeld activities or yield estimation. It is mandatory for these agencies to follow the digital protocol as mentioned in the **Para 18.4**. Services of such agencies may also be utilized by the States/UTs for assessment of localized losses and losses due to post-harvest risks.

      11. **District level Steering Committee:** State/UT Government shall compulsorily constitute a Steering committee in each district to plan, conduct and supervise the CCEs for yield assessment and to provide reports of yield data to the State/UT Nodal department. The Steering committee should be headed by the District level Head of the Department/Organization responsible for conducting CCEs and District Agriculture/Cooperative ofﬁcers, representatives of NSSO and Insurance Companies as members. The Steering committee will compulsorily associate the representatives of Insurance Companies, NSSO, so that they shall be well informed about each and every activity and obtain the requisite information about CCE planning, schedule for conducting CCEs, selection of CCEs plot, sharing of requisite form 2, form 8 etc. and individual CCE result etc. The Head of Steering Committee will be responsible for uploading all requisite information on NCIP i.e. CCE schedule, individual CCE report etc. and imparting training to ﬁeld functionaries responsible for conducting CCEs. Steering Committee will compulsorily send all their

   proceedings / minutes etc. to District Level Monitoring Committee (DLMC) and Nodal ofﬁcer of the State. Concerned Insurance Companies shall compulsorily deploy one well conversant ofﬁcial at the ofﬁce of the Head of the Steering Committee for at least 3 months of the harvesting period for better coordination and obtaining the information of CCEs including CCEs Schedules etc. Concerned Insurance Companies shall nominate their representatives in the steering committee well in advance and also share personal details, contacts, email ID etc. to the nodal departments of the States/UTs while ensuring that the GoI is intimated. It is the responsibility of this designated ofﬁcer of Insurance Company to obtain the plan & detailed schedules of each CCE from the concerned district administration ofﬁcers at the Block/Tehsil/Circle level within that district. District Administration will provide requisite space and logistics at their ofﬁce for the insurance company ofﬁcial. States/UTs will provide the granular information related to schedule of CCEs to the nominated Insurance Company ofﬁcial only. Any delay/non-receipt of information shall be communicated by the nominated ofﬁcial only in the concerned district to the steering committee at the earliest but no later than 7 days of the due scheduled date. The copy of the reminder to the steering committee will compulsorily be forwarded to nodal department of the States/UTs & GoI. Steering committee may also form Electronic/Social Media groups for quick communication about their plan, schedules and activities etc.

      12. In instances where required number of CCEs could not be conducted due to non- availability of adequate cropped area, adverse weather conditions or inadequate infrastructure etc., the yield estimate for such IUs can be generated by using methods such as:

1. Adopting yield estimate of next higher unit, or

2. Adopting the yield of a neighboring IU with maximum correlation.

   Priority of applicability of aforesaid two methods should be notiﬁed by the concerned States/UTs in the notiﬁcation itself, failing which the option of yield estimate of next higher unit would be considered as default. However, this clause shall only be applicable in unavoidable situations and shall be limited to only minimal number of IU units. It cannot be made a general rule to avoid CCEs. Special efforts should be made by the States/UTs to conduct adequate number of CCEs in all notiﬁed units in order to provide appropriate beneﬁts to farmers. However, if State/UTs fail to submit/approve the CCE data within prescribed time then claims will be settled based on the yield data generated using technology.

   13. ## **Modalities for Conducting CCEs for Multi-Picking Crops**

   In case of multi-picking crops e.g. Cotton, Chilly, Tobacco, Tomato, Pea, Fruits (Mango & Apples) & other crops of similar nature, the following procedure shall be followed:

       1. States/UTs shall, in the beginning, specify the number of required picking for each crop both for irrigated and un-irrigated (rainfed) conditions. Ideally it should be as per the NSO/Indian Agricultural Statistic Research Institute (IASRI) deﬁned guidelines. If it is not available, States/UTs in consultation with State Agriculture Universities and concerned ICAR center may identify the required number of pickings. However, as number of actual pickings depends on climatic conditions etc., hence possibility of further pickings, at each picking shall compulsorily be recorded

   in CCE Agri App and the number of actual pickings will be ﬁnal in such cases.

          2. If the required number of CCEs have been done but the required number of pickings have not been done, then for those experiments, statistical factor needs to be used to extrapolate yield to calculate the ﬁnal yield.

          3. Such statistical factor (proportion of picking wise yield) needs to be computed from well conducted CCEs (with the required number of pickings) from the same Taluka separately from Irrigated and Un-irrigated (rainfed) condition. At least data of 5 well conducted CCE should be used for computing the factors.

### **An Example for Yield Calculation for multi-picking crop is mentioned in Table5 below:**

|  Crop |  Experiment no. | Picking 1 Yield (kg) | Picking 2 Yield (kg) | Picking 3 Yield (kg) | Picking4 Yield (kg) | Total Yield (Kg) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  |  | **P1** | **P2** | **P3** | **P4** | **∑P1,P2, P3,P4** |
| Well Conducted CCEs in the Taluka with 4 pickings |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Cotton | E1 | 1 | 1.95 | 2.1 | 1.25 | 6.3 |
| Cotton | E2 | 1 | 2 | 1.75 | 1.4 | 6.15 |
| Cotton | E3 | 0.75 | 1.75 | 1.5 | 1.5 | 5.5 |
| Cotton | E4 | 0.8 | 1.43 | 2.15 | 1.4 | 5.78 |
| Cotton | E5 | 0.95 | 1.85 | 1.4 | 0.75 | 4.95 |
|  | Average | 0.9 | 1.8 | 1.78 | 1.26 | 5.74 |
|  | Factor (Total Yield/Picking Yield) | 6.373\# | 2.128\# | 1.28 \# 2 |  |  |
|  |  | (1st) | (1st \+ 2nd) | (1st\+2nd\+3rd) |  |  |
| CCEs with Less Pickings in any IU within that Taluka |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Cotton | E6 (only 1st Picking) | 1 |  |  |  | 6.373\# |
| Cotton | E7 (only 1st & 2nd Picking) | 1.2 | 1.75 |  |  | 6.278\# |
| Cotton | E8 (only 1st , 2nd & 3rd Picking) | 1.1 | 1.85 | 1.57 |  | 5.795\# |

*Note: \# The factor has been computed as the ratio of average total yield and average yield upto that picking.*

4. In case there is dispute regarding large deviation in picking dates, the average picking dates should be computed from well conducted CCEs at the Taluka level. Accordingly, the picking dates and numbers will be adjusted. For example, if the average picking date for second picking in a particular Taluka is in December and one experiment has shown ﬁrst picking in December, it will be considered as second picking.

   5. If there is no proper CCE (with required number of pickings) even at the Taluka level, it should be considered that no CCE is available and the procedure deﬁned in yield dispute SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) should be followed, i.e. yield should be estimated using technology-based approach. In case the crop has withered and there is no further possibility of having further pickings, the same shall be recorded compulsorily in the mobile application/CCE-Agri App while conducting the current picking experiment. In such cases, no multiplication factor may be used for

   calculation of Actual Yield.

      6. All claims will be settled exclusively on the basis of CCE based yield data available on the NCIP or a combination of the CCE based yields and YES-TECH derived yields, as the case may be. The Actual Yield Data at Crop-IU level shall be automatically synchronized with the NCIP through the CCE Agri App. Once the Actual Yield data is available on the NCIP, the same shall be veriﬁed, uploaded and approved by the concerned District/State authorities on NCIP. For those experiments which were conducted ofﬂine without usage of mobile application due to unforeseen circumstances, the Actual Yield data, along with the location information shall be uploaded and approved by the concerned District administration or State/UT nodal department on the NCIP. However, this shall be an exception and should be exercised in rare cases and such CCEs should not exceed 5% of the total CCEs. Actual Yield data through any other mode other than the NCIP shall not be accepted. If the yield data is not uploaded and approved within pre-deﬁned cut-off date by the concerned authority/department, the concerned Insurance Company, may inform the State/UT and the GoI well in time to initiate appropriate corrective action.

         7. Insurance Companies should be given complete access to co-witness the CCEs, the digital images of the CCEs and relevant data in the requisite format (electronic/physical) by the State/UT Government on a real-time basis. A schedule should be formally given/shared with nominated representatives of Insurance Companies who are also part of the Steering Committee, sufﬁciently in advance without fail to help them coordinate with the ﬁeld functionaries and mobilize their manpower accordingly. For this purpose, the Insurance Companies shall permanently station one representative in the Steering Committee at the concerned district ofﬁce of the department/agency mandated to conduct CCEs for proper day to day liaison **(Para 18.5.11).** State and District administration shall also provide necessary space in the concerned ofﬁce & facilitate sharing of information related to conduct of CCEs. The State/UT may not provide any documents such as Form-1, Form-2 etc. to the Insurance Companies, however, the State/UT should provide facility for physical veriﬁcation of documents like Form-1, Form-2 etc. on request of Insurance Companies at their premises.

19. ## **Dispute resolution regarding Yield Data/Crop Loss Data**

    1. During the earlier years of implementation of PMFBY, various types of yield disputes were observed, leading to unnecessary delays in the claim settlement. The following chart shows the procedures to be adopted in various cases.

### **Chart: Procedures to be followed in different yield dispute cases**

![][image1]

2. Wherever the yield estimates reported at IU level are abnormally low or high vis-à- vis the general crop condition the Insurance Companies in consultation with State/UT Government can make use of various technology solutions (e.g. Satellite based vegetation or other indices, weather parameters, etc.) or other technologies (including statistical analysis, crop models etc.) to conﬁrm the yield estimates. If the Insurance Company witnesses any anomaly or deﬁciency in the mid-season yield assessment and/or CCE based actual yield data (partial /consolidated) received from the State/UT Government, the same shall be brought into the notice of concerned State/UT department within 7 days from date of receipt of yield data with speciﬁc observations/remarks providing intimation to the GoI and anomaly, if any, may be resolved in the next 7 days by the Head of the Nodal Department for State/UT Government. If the dispute is not resolved, the aggrieved party may file an appeal with the State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) for dispute resolution (Constitution of STAC is deﬁned in **Para 19.5**) to pass a speaking order. **A suggestive checklist for STAC to mandatorily follow while deciding on the crop yield disputes is annexed at Annexure-IV of these guidelines.** In case the matter stands unresolved even after examination by STAC, the aggrieved party may file an appeal with the Central Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) of GoI, in the prescribed format, along with all relevant data & documents, including minutes of the meetings of STAC and checklist as above, as per the conditions speciﬁed in **Para 19.7.1. However, data with anomalies which is not reported within 7 days shall be treated as accepted to the Insurance Company**. The protocol of the timelines deﬁned above shall also be applicable to the actual Yield data being provided by the concerned State department in batches, i.e. Crop-wise-District-wise lots of data and timelines for each batch of data shall be counted separately/batch wise. Unnecessary delay in the ﬁnalization of yield data will attract penal interest on due claim amount payable to the farmers as per the provisions mentioned at **Para**

   ### **16.14 & 16.15**.

   3. The existing Central TAC comprising of representatives from the DES, DA\&FW, Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC), National Statistical Organization (NSO), Indian Agricultural Statistical Research Institute (IASRI), shall be further augmented and constituted under the chairpersonship of Additional Secretary, DA\&FW. Additional members on case to case basis may be drawn from various organizations namely, relevant institution under Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI), National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Space Applications Centre (SAC), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), National Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development (NABARD), India Meteorological Department (IMD), MITR of the Concerned State/UT or any other such organization as may be deemed fit by the chairperson of the committee.

   4. The Central TAC shall review all technical matters related to the execution of the Scheme. In case, the matter requires further focused deliberations, the Central TAC will refer the issue to the Technical Agency (TA) (**refer Para 19.7.2**). The TA will compulsorily take the inputs/reports/relevant information from the concerned State/UT Department and Insurance Company and may also opt for representatives of other organizations/experts (if required) with the permission of chairperson of the Central TAC and follow the procedure as deﬁned in the SOP.

   5. State shall also constitute the State/UT Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) on a similar pattern to resolve disputes. The STAC may be chaired by the Principal Secretary/Secretary/Additional Chief Secretary of the concerned Department with members from State Agricultural University, State Remote Sensing Application Center, IMD (state center), DES, any ICAR center in the State/UT, NSO, and concerned MITR etc. However, in case of disagreement between the concerned parties, the case may be referred to the Central TAC along with recommendations and ﬁndings for further deliberation/examination and decision.

   6. TAC/TA/STAC shall deliberate and examine the subject matter and indicate their views/decisions based on statistical/technological inputs and other related scientiﬁc and technical parameters as detailed in the SOP.

   7. ## **The SOP to deal with Yield Assessment dispute cases is as under**

      1. **When to use this SOP:** This SOP shall be followed only when there is a dispute about the crop yield values between the State/UT Government and Insurance Company/ies and in the case when it remains unresolved at the Head of the Nodal Department level and STAC (**Para 19.2**) and has been referred to the Central Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which in turn decides that the matter needs to be referred to a Technical Agency (TA). The dispute can be brought to the TAC, only in the case, where all of the following conditions are satisﬁed. All cases not falling in these criteria shall be decided by the head of Nodal Department with the approval of competent authority and their decision shall be ﬁnal and binding on all concerned.

* There is more than 25% difference between the yield estimated by the State/UT Government and the Insurance Company.

* There is sufﬁcient documentary evidence that the mid-season yield assessment and/or CCEs have not been conducted in the required numbers and as per the standard protocol, in at least 20% IUs for a particular crop in a given district or 20%

  of total planned loss assessment surveys/CCEs for the particular crop in the given district.

* The matter has been considered by STAC but could not be resolved at the State/UT level.

* The Insurance Company has already carried out the technical analysis of the data in consultation of the State Government/UT Administration or in collaboration with Central/State/empaneled agencies and has used satellite/model/ weather data to support its objection.

  2. **The Organizations to which TAC can refer the case:** The organizations can bethe Central Government or autonomous organizations, which have requisite capacity to carry out such analyses, such as: MNCFC (DA\&FW), SAC (ISRO), NRSC (ISRO), empaneled MITRs and other similar government organizations as decided by Central TAC. Hereafter, these organizations will be referred to as Technical Agencies (TA).

     3. ### **Data to be provided by State/UT Government to TA:**

* All crop loss assessment surveys or yield assessment survey or CCE data of the contested area, in digital/soft format, along with photographs and other collateral data, as collected during yield assessment survey or CCEs. The yield assessment survey or CCE data should ideally be geo referenced.

* Village level crop area estimates.

* Long term (at least 10 years) data of crop yield at GP level (if not available, at least at Taluka/block level) in digital format, (preferably Excel).

* Long term (at least 10 years) data of weather parameters (daily or weekly) at GP level (if not available, at least at Taluka /block level). The weather parameters should cover at least, rainfall, rainy days and temperature, in digital/soft format, (preferably Excel).

* Any information about pest/disease attack, hailstorm, cyclones, inundations, heavy rainfall or any other natural/ manmade disasters in that area.

* Report of any analysis carried out by the State/UT to support its claim.

  4. ### **Data to be provided by Insurance Company:**

* Data of the co-observed crop loss assessment surveys or yield assessment survey or CCEs collected by Insurance Companies in digital/soft format, along with photographs and other collateral data, as collected during yield assessment survey or CCE.

* Data of weather observatories\*, if maintained or sourced by Insurance Company, in the contested area.

* Report of the technical studies\* carried out by the Insurance Company to support its claim.

* Detailed reasons for the yield data being perceived as contested.

* Any UAV data/output collected from the contested area.

  *(\*This data shall only be considered where government approved agency / empaneled agency has been used **Para 2.20**).*

  5. ### **Analysis to be carried out by the Technical Agency:**

  Among the steps given below, any 3 steps should be followed from (a) to (d) and any one step should be followed from (e) to (f). The steps in (g) and (h) are compulsory.

1) **Statistical analysis of the yield assessment survey and/or CCE yield data:** Basic Statistical Parameters (Mean, Variance, Coefﬁcient of Variation (CV), Range, Standard Error, etc.) Scatter plots, Test of Normality (Shapiro-Wilk test, Quartile- Quartile plot, box and Whisker plot, Skewness and Kurtosis, etc.). It also needs to be checked whether yield assessment survey or CCEs were done using the proper sampling design. Village level crop area may also be checked to identify reasons for inadequate number of yield assessment survey or CCE.

2) **Analysis of Weather Data:** Weekly Rainfall Deviations (at least at block level) or at grid level using gridded or satellite-based data, Dry-spell Occurrence, Temperature Anomaly, Soil Moisture Analysis (either from satellite or model data) and any other available weather parameters (related to crop condition), either from ground or satellite data. Another rainfall-based index, which can also be studied, is Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI).

   SPI can be developed using WINDS data and/or IMD gridded rainfall data or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Centre (NOAA CPC) rainfall data. However, while using gridded data (either from satellite or ground stations), appropriate resolution should be used at appropriate level. For example,

   0.25 degree data should be used only at the district level and not at the block/village level. High resolution weather data can also be sourced from weather companies.

3) **Analysis of Long-term Yield Data: Analysis of** previous 10 years' yield data (at GP or Taluka level) shall be carried out to assess the variations in yield data. The analysis should include yield ranges, mean yield, standard deviation, and CV.

4) **Analysis of Other collateral data:** Other data or reports, which should be considered, include Crop Weather Watch Report (DES, DA\&FW),NSSO Supervised yield assessment survey or CCE data, Forecasting Agriculture Output using Space Agrometeorology and Land Based Observations (FASAL) program crop reports, drought assessment reports prepared by MNCFC, Market arrivals and prices data for 2-3 years ([http://agmarknet.gov.in/),](http://agmarknet.gov.in/\)) crop condition data available on VEDAS platform (https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vedas/), Disaster maps from Bhuvan platform, IMD weather bulletins, weather information/ forecasts available on MOSDAC (https://[www.mosdac.gov.in/),](http://www.mosdac.gov.in/\)) etc.

5) **Analysis of Vegetation Index from Satellite Data:** The vegetation indices, which can be used for this purpose are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Wetness Index (NDWI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI), etc. To derive these indices, satellite data of appropriate resolution should be used (Table 6).

   ### **Table 6: Types of resolution to be used for vegetation index derivation for different levels of analysis**

| Level of Analysis | Spatial Resolution to be used | Examples of Satellite/Sensor |
| :---- | ----- | :---- |
| Village level | 5-30 m or better | Resourcesat 2/2A: Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor (LISS) IV (5.8m)/LISS III (23.5m) , Sentinel 2:MSI (10 m); |

|  |  | Rapid Eye (6.5 m); SPOT 5 HRG (5,10 m), LandSat 8 OLI (30m). |
| ----- | ----- | :---- |
| Block/Tehsil level | 10-60 m | Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS III (23.5 m), Landsat 8: OLI (30m); Sentinel 2:MSI (10 m); Resourcesat 2/2A: AWIFS (56m). |
| District level | 50-500 m | Resourcesat 2/2A: AWiFS (56 m); Proba V (100 m), MODIS (250m/500m) or any other satellite. |

However, wherever long-term satellite data is needed, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (250 m/500m) data can be used, but it should not be used for village level information. Ideally for deriving crop speciﬁc vegetation indices, crop maps should be overlaid on the data. Generally, for few major crops, crop maps are prepared under FASAL project of GoI. Crop maps can be generated using either optical or microwave remote sensing Synthetic Aperture Data (SAR) data of appropriate resolution. Wherever, crop maps are not available, agricultural area map should be used. Agricultural area map can be obtained from the Land Use (LU)/Land Cover (LC\*) available with NRSC or SRSCs. For assessing NDVI or NDWI deviation percentage, data of latest 2-3 years should be used or at least data of a normal crop year should be used.

6) **Crop Growth Modelling:** Yield loss estimates can be made using crop simulation models such as Decision Support System for Agro-Technology Transfer (DSSAT)/ Info Crop, etc., or the models recommended in the YES-TECH Manual 2023\. However, care should be taken to use well calibrated and validated models and also models should be run in at higher spatial resolution, at least 5 km. Crop Growth/Simulation models should be assimilated with remote sensing products (e.g. crop map, phenology, Leaf Area Index (LAI), etc.)

7) **Identiﬁcation of Outliers:** All these above analyses can be used to check whether there was any reason for yield deviation as presented in the yield assessment survey or CCE data. Then a yield proxy map may be prepared. The Yield proxy map can be derived from remote sensing vegetation indices (single or combination of indices), crop simulation model output, remote sensing based semi-physical models or an integration of various parameters which are related to crop yield, such as soil, weather (gridded), satellite-based products, etc. Whatever yield proxies to be used, it is the responsibility of the TA to record documentary evidence (from their or other's published work) that the yield proxy is related to the particular crop's yield. Then the IU level yields need to be overlaid on the yield proxy map. Both yield proxy and yield assessment survey or CCE yield can be divided into 4-5 categories (e.g. Very good, Good, Medium, Poor, Very poor). Wherever there is large mismatch between yield proxy and the yield assessment survey or CCE yield (more than 2 levels), the yield assessment survey or CCE yield for that IU can be considered, as outliers.

8) **Computing Yield for the Outliers:** For the IUs, where the yield was considered as outlier, the yield may be estimated by developing empirical models (statistically signiﬁcant, with low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between long-term yield data (at IU level or, if not available, higher administrative level) and weather and remote sensing-based index data. If good quality long-term data is not available or if the model is not signiﬁcant, when using time series data for an administrative unit (GP/Mandal/Hobli/ Block/Taluk/Revenue Circle etc.), the model can also be developed using the previous 1-2 years' data across the IUs/administrative unit, within a district. Using these models, yield for the concerned year should be estimated. The estimates of only statistically signiﬁcant models (p-value \< 0.1) will

   be considered. RMSE (%) of the Yield estimated from the model estimates, in comparison with the actual historical yield should preferably be less than 30%. The ﬁnal yield estimate will be a combination of yield assessment survey or CCE (whatever experiments available) estimates and technology estimates. The estimates will be combined by giving weightage to the inverse of the errors of the estimates. If the model was not statistically signiﬁcant, the average of estimated yields of adjacent blocks should be used (Note: Each and every case may have speciﬁc and special cause related to a problem and may not be considered as a reference for any other case.) Each time, the stage of the crop should be given prior importance e.g. 10 mm rainfall at vegetative stage and at harvest or post-harvest stage has different impacts; a small amount rainfall having devastating wind-speed have different impact than high amount of rainfall having calm or no-wind. The TA needs to take into account all these factors to consider each of the cases as an individual and special case.

   6. **Time required for the analysis**: The analysis needs to be completed by the concerned TA, within one month of receipt of all mentioned data from the Insurance Company and the State/UT Government.

      7. **Funds needed for the analysis**: All the analysis will be carried out by the TA, with its existing resources. However, if there is any need of procurement of priced data or services, this may be funded by the concerned Insurance Company or the State/UT Government, whichever organization has brought the dispute issue up to TAC.

      8. **Support to Technical Agency:** The TA, if required, can take the support from the experts of SRSCs and SAUs. For this the State Agriculture Department will issue required instructions to concerned experts/agencies. A concerned ofﬁcer of the PMFBY, CPMU will coordinate between the TA and the State/UT.

      9. **General Suggestions:** Though this SOP identiﬁes the procedure for yield dispute resolutions, in the long run, it will beneﬁt the scheme and the farmers, if there is no dispute. The following suggestions are made to avoid dispute:

* The State/UTs shall conduct the crop loss assessment survey and crop yield assessment survey though CCEs following the standard procedure (proper sampling plan) and collect the data using Crop Survey App & CCE-Agri App respectively.

* State/UTs need to pro-actively use technology for more accurate crop yield estimation.

* State/UTs should develop mechanism to resolve disputes at the State/UT level through STAC by using the technical support from State/UT level organizations, such as Agricultural Universities, SRSCs, and ICAR Centers located in the State/UT, local IMD ofﬁce, etc.

* The Insurance Companies should proactively, get involved with the State/UTs for supervision of yield assessment survey and CCEs.

* The Insurance Companies should increasingly invest in the use of technology to support the loss assessment.

* There should be better coordination between the State/UTs and the Insurance Companies.

20. ## **Use of Innovative Technologies in Yield Estimation**

    1. **Rationalization of CCEs \- Smart Sampling Technique (SST)**

       1. It is observed that concerns regarding crop yield estimation in the insurance units are increasing and thereby reducing the efﬁciency of the crop insurance mechanism. Disputes on the quality of yield data is a challenge in the effective implementation of the Scheme. Technology interventions are highly recommended from time to time to bring improvements in the crop yield assessment. Under these guidelines, implementation of SST is mandatory for improving the CCE ﬁeld's selection. Through smart sampling, the CCE ﬁelds in each insurance unit can be selected based on the yield proxy index, thus accounting for the spatial variability in crop yield. The primary and the unique advantage of this technique is achieving improved distribution of CCEs in the notiﬁed IUs thereby leading to more representative yield estimates compared to conventional random sampling approach. Crop condition and crop risks occurrence, if any, during major part of the season are taken into account while developing a-priori yield proxy. The add-on beneﬁts of smart sampling include:

1) Notiﬁcation of CCE locations only a few days before harvest, thus maintaining the secrecy of plots and minimizing moral hazards and

2) Identiﬁcation of CCE locations through digital map base, thus minimizing human bias/preferences in locating the ﬁelds. Digital database of CCE facilitates linking of CCE data with satellite data and different thematic datasets.

   2. The two important input data layers for implementing smart sampling are crop map and crop yield proxy map in digital form in moderate to high spatial resolution.

      1. **Crop map:** Satellite derived accurate crop map is a pre-requisite for smart sampling. Crop mapping accuracy depends on many aspects, which include:

         1) spatial resolution of satellite data vis-à-vis the ﬁeld size,

            2) the spectral bands being used for classiﬁcation,

            3) the classiﬁcation algorithm,

            4) the cropping pattern(mono cropping or mixed cropping) and

            5) granularity and quality of the ground truth data used in analysis of satellite data.

   Both commission error (e.g. non-paddy areas represented as paddy) and omission error (e.g. paddy ﬁelds are represented as non-paddy) would affect the efﬁciency of smart sampling. Satellite data of 10-30 m spatial resolution and crop mapping accuracy more than 80% are recommended for generating crop map for Smart Sampling.

         2. **Crop yield proxy map:** Ability of the yield proxy to capture the spatial variability of yield within the IU largely determines the efﬁciency of Smart sampling technique. GoI has developed a protocol for yield proxy generation **as part of the CCE Manual**. The details of yield proxy generation using multiple satellite, weather and ground data are provided in the protocol. The yield proxy deﬁned in the protocol is available in 10-30 m resolution, which has higher accuracy for yield estimation, as shown in various pilot studies. State/UTs may adopt that method for yield proxy generation. The yield proxy layer has to be generated in time, preferably 30 days and not later than 20 days before harvest time.

      3. **Selection of CCE ﬁelds:** The Crop map should be co-registered with the Yield proxy map and overlaid on it. Density slicing based on 4-6 quantiles (divide the frequency distribution in equal proportion) should be carried out for the yield proxy of each district/block (6 classes are taken if stratiﬁcation is done at district level and 4 classes are made if stratiﬁcation is done at Block/Tehsil level). IU Boundaries are overlaid and for each IU 2-3 major classes are considered. 4 locations (primary) are randomly selected from these classes, proportionate to number of pixels under each class. For each point, 2 additional points (secondary and tertiary) are selected from the same class, as reserve. For each point, the latitude/longitude, class category, GP name, Taluka and District names are to be provided to the SRSCs. Field survey numbers corresponding to each location are to be identiﬁed by SRSC using cadastral maps and provided to the ﬁeld functionaries at least 5-days before harvesting. Wherever cadastral map is not available, geographical locations (Latitude and Longitude) of the ﬁelds are to be given to the ﬁeld functionaries, who can locate using any navigation App.

      4. **Crops to be covered:** SST for CCE ﬁelds selection may be implemented for the notified crops, wherever satellite-based crop mapping and multi-index-based yield proxy layer generation are made available by MNCFC. Generally, it is recommended for main crops like Paddy, Wheat, Jowar, Mustard, Cotton etc., since the procedures for generating the above inputs are fairly operational. For other crops, methodologies are to be standardized and the State/UTs are advised to undertake such Research & Development (R\&D) studies for standardization of approaches so that a greater number of crops can be brought under the purview of smart sampling.

      5. **Variable Methodology:** Selection of right data and right techniques of analysis for crop mapping and crop yield proxy generation determines the efﬁciency of smart sampling. One methodology with one set of inputs for all regions and crops may not work. Diverse crop growing environments may need using different methods for different regions. One has to check for the robustness of the methodology by applying certain quality parameters such as sensitivity of crop yield proxy and accuracy of crop layer using ground truth or secondary data.

      6. Accordingly, the State/UTs are required to share the list of district wise crop calendar including harvesting window (i.e. Start Date and End Date) for Kharif and Rabi crops for the implementation of SST. In this regard the following shall be followed:

         1. The State/UTs shall select and notify the districts and crops for the implementation of SST and no other sampling method shall be used for these districts and crops for conducting CCEs. However, the State/UTs may have a separate set of CCEs for GCES.

         2. MNCFC will be the nodal agency for SST implementation in coordination with the State Remote Sensing Centers (SRSCs). The State/UTs must bring the SRSCs onboard for SST implementation especially for providing village boundaries, location of SST for identification of plot etc.

         3. The State/UTs shall provide the following information to MNCFC for generation of SST points:

1. List of Districts and Crops for implementation of SST as part of the notification itself.

2. 100 Ground Truth (GT) points of the identified Crops in the District, One Month

   before the start of the harvesting season.

3. Boundaries of the Insurance Units in vector format (Shapefiles).

   4. Location of SST based CCEs shall be shared by MNCFC with the concerned State/UT Agriculture Department 15 days before the harvesting period, as notified in the crop calendar as latest by the timelines mention at Table 2 of **Para 16.4** of these guidelines.

      7. State/UTs are advised to make suitable preparedness to ensure implementation of SST for selection of CCE plots for the selected Districts/Crops and must work in close Coordination with the MNCFC, as any delay in providing the requested data to MNCFC will result in generation of SST points.

   2. ## **Direct Yield Estimation through Technology**

      1. ### **Yield Estimation System Based on Technology (YES-TECH)**

         1. For addressing the issue of reliability of CCE based crop yield assessment in terms of their accuracy, representativeness and timeliness, it was envisaged that innovative technologies such as satellite remote sensing, drone, data modeling, AWS/ARG, Artiﬁcial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AI\&ML) real time analytics & transmission of data etc. shall be utilized. This will ensure accurate assessment of yield and timely payment of claims to farmers. Various studies carried out by national and international organizations, including MNCFC, NRSC, SAC, Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), World Bank, etc. have shown that the use of satellite, weather, soil and crop data, along with images/video capture of crop growth at various stages and accurate sample CCE data collection can improve the yield data quality/timeliness and support timely claim processing and payments.

         2. The GoI, with the support of national/international centers as mentioned in **Para**

   **20.2.1.1** above, SRSCs and SAUs, initiated pilot studies on technology-based crop yield estimation using technology and a small number of good quality CCEs as ground truth for model calibration and validation. The results of these pilot studies have been evaluated and recommended for up scaling at national level.

         3. Accordingly, the GoI has initiated nation-wide rollout of Yield Estimation System based on Technology (YES-TECH), from Kharif 2023 season onwards, towards enabling large scale adoption of technology-based yield estimates for yield loss and insurance claim assessments under PMFBY.

         4. YES-TECH Manual 2023 has been notified by the GoI and all the provisions of the said manual, as amended from time to time, shall be applicable to the scheme.

         5. Technology-based yield estimation shall be implemented on graded scale i.e., minimum 30% weightage to technology driven yield estimates in the first year along with 70% to traditional Crop Cutting Experiments approach. Gradual increase of 10%-20% thereafter will be made based on the experience of stakeholders. However, the State/UTs may opt for increasing the percentage and give higher weightage to the technology derived yield estimates from Kharif 2023 itself.

         6. The concept of assigning the weightage to technology is being roped in for reducing the moral hazards & increasing objectivity, however the conventional CCEs (to be captured through CCE-Agri app) will continue to be conducted as being done presently.

         7. The weightage to technology shall be increased in the following manner if State/UTs do not conduct their Crop Cutting Experiments through the CCE-Agri app:

| % of CCE conducted through app w.r.t. total C conducted in a district | Weightage to technology |
| ----- | :---: |
| \>75% | 30% |
| \>50% but \< or \=75% | 35% |
| \>25% but \< or \=50% | 40% |
| \>10% but \< or \=25% | 45% |
| \< 10% | 50% |

         8. State/UTs will be assisted by the following entities in implementation of YES-TECH:

1. **Mentor Institutes for Technology Rollout (MITR)** shall supervise the adoption and implementation of technical approaches for yield assessment. These mentor institutions may be National level Technology institutions (Like NRSC, SAC, ICAR etc.), State Agriculture Universities, State Remote Sensing Centre or any other such institution.

2. **Technology Implementation Partner (TIP)** shall be the agency that shall run the models finalized by the respective State/UT. TIP can be a private sector player or even a suitably qualified public institution. State/UTs shall choose TIP but to be selected as a TIP they will have to be technically empaneled by the YES-TECH Committee.

3. The MITRs, TIPs and other stakeholders shall follow all relevant provisions of YES- TECH manual 2023, as amended from time to time.

   9. Cost of implementing the YES-TECH component would be shared between the GoI and the State/UT Government on sunset basis as under:

|  |  Particulars | Sharing Ratio/Pattern between Central and State Governments/UT Administrations for YES-TECH |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | :---- |
|  |  | 2023-24 (1st year) | 2024-25 (2nd year) | 2025-26 (3rd year) | 2026-27 onwards |
| 1 | North-eastern and Himalayan States/Uts | 90:10 | 90:10 | 90:10 | As per subsidy sharing pattern |
| 2\. | Other States/UTs | 90:10 | 80:20 | 60:40 |  |

      2. ### **Collection of Real-time Photos and Observations of Crops (CROPIC)**

         1. Under this initiative, crop health will be monitored by taking periodic photos of standing or peril-affected crops at pre-determined interval of its growth with GPS coordinates, three to five times during the season for assessing the crop condition at different stages of the crop cycle.

         2. This will also greatly help in reducing the moral hazard as availability of periodic photos of crop health will ensure that there is suitable data available to validate a sudden and precipitous fall in yield at the time of the CCE.

         3. Further, this data can subsequently be analyzed using AI/ML tools to further augment the YES-TECH models.

         4. The use of CROPIC Mobile App for collection of crop photographs shall be mandatory for Insurance Companies and State Governments/UTs. Other rural channels viz. Krishi Sakhi, Bima Mitras etc. may also be engaged in the collection of crop photographs. The same may be made optional for farmers to crowd-source the crop photographs.

         5. Monetary incentive of Rs. 10/- per field / visit (maximum Rs. 50/- per field per year) for sending crop condition photo from the ground level shall be given to identified individuals like Farmers, Krishi Sakhis, Bima Mitras, ground level staff of Agriculture, Economics & Statistics & Revenue departments of the States/UTs and any other channel notified by the GoI. This initiative shall be dovetailed with other initiatives of the GoI.

         6. A detailed SOP/Manual and modalities of the CROPIC platform shall be notified by the GoI separately.

   3. ## **Concerns in Yield Data Quality and Timelines for Data Reporting**

      1. It has been observed that the normal CCE process being followed for estimating yield is lacking in reliability, accuracy and speed, which affects claim settlement. There is a need for real time, good quality and reliable actual yield-data for which mandatory use of smart phones / handheld devices has to be done for capturing images, location of the CCE and for online transmission of data on NCIP through CCEs Agri-app. RST using satellite and drones, weather data, model etc. may also be used for the purpose of increasing accuracy and speed of yield estimation through CCEs.

      2. If the CCE derived yield data is not provided by the State/UTs within the stipulated timeline then technology derived Synthetic Yield data (i.e. crop yield estimated/simulated using the Models described in the YES-TECH Manual 2023\) will be used for claims settlements. Such Synthetic Yield data of a crop will be compared with corresponding yield data (derived from CCE based data) for yield loss assessment. Synthetic yield data is meant for the purpose of timely settlement of claims when CCE-derived yield data availability is either delayed or disputed. Synthetic yield or technology derived yield is generated by the agencies designated by the GoI. The GoI will convene the meeting of the Central TAC constituted for this purpose with the concerned State/UT Government and the Insurance Companies to ﬁnalize the technology-based claim calculation for that crop. If the Central TAC recommends, the GoI will send a request letter to MNCFC (Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre)/ Other Designated Agency (e.g. MITR, SAC, NRSC, IASRI, IMD, etc.) for the calculation of synthetic yield (model-based yield) for that crop. After the meeting of Expert Committee and the MNCFC/ Other Designated Agency will share the synthetic yield within one month from the ﬁnal receipt of required input data from the State/UT and/or Insurance Companies and the claims will be settled based on synthetic yield provided by MNCFC or any Other Designated Agency.

   4. ## **Fund for Innovation and Technology (FIAT)**

      1. Fund for Innovation and Technology (FIAT) has been created by the GoI wherein

   resources shall be allocated for meeting designated percentage of GoI share/100% grant in various technological interventions undertaken by the GoI/State Governments/UT Administrations as admissible. The existing technology fund has been restructured as FIAT and available fund have also been transferred.

      2. The FIAT shall be funded from the amount already collected from the corpus generated from excess farmers share of premium surrendered by Insurance Companies due to application of Area Correction Factor (ACF) along with corresponding interest accrued on such funds and penalties imposed on Insurance Companies on account of unsatisfactory performance. The minor insurance claims of the value as decided by the State/UT against any individual farmer shall also be moved to this fund instead of being credited to farmer’s account.

      3. The FIAT shall be utilized for the following activities under the scheme:

1. Yield Estimation System Based on Technology (YES-TECH),

2. Weather Information Network & Data System (WINDS)

3. Collection of Real-time Photos and Observations of Crops (CROPIC),

4. To finance and subsidize research & development and improvement in technology solutions (like Drones, IoT, Remote Sensing etc.),

5. To finance innovation and development of new insurance and risk protection solutions under the product Sandbox approach, including but not limited to SARTHI (Sandbox for Agricultural & Rural Security, Technology & Insurance)

6. For giving grants to Academic, Research and Development institutions for carrying out research, design and development initiatives, risk protection products and technology solutions for crop damage and yield loss estimation, crop identification & digitization etc.

   4. The SOP for management of FIAT and release of funds for aforesaid activities shall be issued by the GoI, separately.

   5. **Support to the States and Insurance Companies for Technology Adoption:** PMFBY relies more on technology-based solutions for enhancing efﬁciency and objectivity in its implementation. For ﬁnalizing the best possible methodologies corresponding to the provisions of OGs, State/UTs and Insurance Companies need the support of Technology Institutions. This involves a lot of preparatory work by the State/UTs and Insurers for implementing the scheme. In this connection, State/UTs are advised to take the support of MNCFC, SRSCs, National Institutes like MITR, SAC (ISRO), NRSC (ISRO), IMD and ICAR to undertake research and development of innovative technologies in agricultural applications. Crop maps and satellite indices that are being generated at MNCFC under various projects like FASAL, National Agriculture Drought Assessment and Monitoring System (NADAMS), Coordinated Horticulture Assessment and Management using Geo-iNformatics (CHAMAN) etc. can be made available to State/UTs by MNCFC for the purpose of developing the technology interventions. This would avoid duplication of efforts by the State/UTs and the insurers.

   6. **Training and Capacity Building:** PMFBY relies largely on technology-based products and services for efﬁciency, transparency and objectivity in its implementation.  All  the  stakeholders  should  therefore  create  necessary

   infrastructure, data collection systems and manpower for technology adoption. In this connection, State/UTs and Insurance Companies have to be given regular training for better understanding of the new guidelines and developing the methods for implementation. Therefore, Training and Capacity building programs shall be curated and developed by the GoI with the support of MNCFC, SAC, NRSC, and ICAR institutes.

21. ## **Assessment of Claims & Claim Settlement**

    1. Payment of Claim under standard PMFBY is the responsibility of concerned Insurance Companies. The Insurance Companies shall therefore take all the necessary steps to take appropriate reinsurance cover for their portfolio in order to safeguard insured's interest. In case of total premium to total claims ratio exceeds 1:3.5 or percentage of claims to Sum Insured exceeds 35%, whichever is higher, at the National Level in a specific crop season, then Government will provide protection to Insurance Companies. The losses exceeding the abovementioned level in the crop season would be met from equal contribution by the GoI and the concerned State Governments/UT Administrations. The claim settlement under the scheme shall be mandatorily assessed and processed as per the applicable relevant provisions of these guidelines. No other provisions and practices or processes or other schemes etc. shall be considered for claim assessment and settlement under PMFBY. The claim settlement protocol under basic cover and all other add-on covers are explained in details as below:

    2. ## **Yield Loss due to Wide-spread Calamities under Basic Cover**

       1. If the Actual Yield per hectare of the insured crop for the Insurance Unit (calculated on basis of requisite number of CCEs or a combination of CCE & technology derived yield estimates, as the case may be) in insured season, falls short of the speciﬁed Threshold Yield for the season, all insured farmers growing that crop in that IU are deemed to have suffered a shortfall of similar magnitude in yield. PMFBY seeks to provide coverage against such contingency.

    'Claim' shall be calculated at IU level as per the following formula:

          (Threshold Yield \- Actual Yield) Threshold Yield

× Sum Insured

Where, Threshold Yield (TY) for a crop in a notiﬁed insurance unit is the average yield of the best 5 years from the past seven years multiplied by applicable Indemnity Level for that crop as notiﬁed by concerned State for the season.

## **Illustration**

In table below, assumed yield of wheat for the last 7 years is given for insurance unit area of "X". Calculation of TY for Rabi 2015-16 season is given in Table 7 below:

| Year | 2008-09 | 2009-10 | 2010-11 | 2011-12 | 2012-13 | 2013-14 | 2014-15 |
| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Yield (kg / ha) | 4,500 | 3,750 | 2,000 | 4,250 | 1,800 | 4,300 | 1,750 |

The years of 2012-13 and 2014-15 have the lowest yields.

Total yield of seven years is 22,350 kg/ha and that of two lowest yield years is 3550 kg/ha i.e. (1,800+1,750). Therefore, according to the provision, the average of the best ﬁve years excluding the two lowest yield years will be (22,350 – 3,550

\=18,800/5) i.e., 3,760 kg/ha. Hence, threshold yield at 90%, 80% and 70% of indemnity levels will be 3,384 kg/ha, 3,008 kg/ha and 2,632 kg/ha respectively.

2. District Level Joint Committee (DLJC) will be constituted which will look after the invoking of On-Account Payment under mid-season adversity, prevented sowing, localized calamities and post-harvest losses.

   3. ## **Prevented/Failed Sowing and Prevented Planting/Germination Claims**

      1. Insurance cover will be provided to farmers in case of widespread incidence of eligible risks (**Para 5.2.1**) affecting crops in more than 75% of the area sown in a notiﬁed unit at early stage of sowing which is up to 30 days from the start of sowing **(as per the crop calendar notiﬁed by the States/UTs)** but no later than 15 days from cut-off date for enrolment (as notified by the State/UT Government)., leading to the total loss of crop or in a condition where farmers are not in a position to either sow or transplant the same crop again.

      2. ## **Eligibility Criteria**

         1. This add-on cover will only be available if this cover is notiﬁed by the State/UT.

         2. Notiﬁed IUs will be eligible for "Prevented Sowing/ Planting" pay-out only if more than 75% of Crop-wise, normal sown area for notiﬁed crop in the IU experienced unsown/prevented sowing/germination failure during the sowing period **(as per the crop calendar notiﬁed by the State/UTs)** due to occurrence of widespread incidence of eligible risks. Normal sown area of the crops will be the average of actual sown area of the preceding three seasons.

         3. Only those farmers are eligible for ﬁnancial support under this cover who have paid the premium i.e. the premium amount has been debited from their account before the peril occurrence notification was issued by the State/UT Government for invoking this provision for compensation. Banks must ensure that the farmers’ premium is debited within 15 days from the sanction or renewal of KCC loan of all eligible loanee farmers and before the cut-off date for debiting the premium.

         4. The provision could be invoked for a speciﬁc crop or a group of crops in notiﬁed IU, by the Nodal Department of the State Governments/UT Administrations on the basis of the recommendation submitted by DLMC supported by evidence/weather reports, other proxy weather indicators and the joint loss assessment survey subject to the fulﬁlment of the conditions speciﬁed in these guidelines.

         5. The eligibility of claim settlement shall be decided based on the outcome of the joint loss assessment surveys carried out by the representatives of Insurance Company, District Administration/State Government’s/UT Administration’s Nodal Department and Farmers. In case of a dispute/disagreement between the stakeholders regarding the quantum/extent of loss reported by the Joint Loss Assessment committee, the crop loss assessment/estimation for the eligibility of the claims will be done using technology derived solutions such as weather/remote-sensing indices along with loss assessment surveys of Joint Committee with the weightage of 70% and 30% respectively for the ﬁnal assessment and evaluation of the extent of loss.

   Acceptance of the technology driven extent of loss will be binding on all stakeholders.

         6. STAC in coordination with State Remote Sensing Application Center or TIP appointed under YES-TECH (for the crops notified under Crop Model Matrix (CMM)) will conduct estimation and assessment of the loss as mentioned in **Para 21.3.2.5** based on the protocol developed by MNCFC. STAC may take the help of MNCFC if they desire.

         7. The amount payable would be 25% of the gross total Sum Insured and the insurance coverage shall get terminated. Farmers can have the alternative to sow shorter duration, resistant crops and avail crop insurance on such crops within the enrolment period for the same. **Enrollment for such alternative crops shall be allowed up to 15 days from the enrolment cut-off date mentioned in the notification, subject to the condition that such notification is issued by the State/UT Government within 15 days after the cut-off date for enrollment and debit of premium and the alternative crops also having already been notified by the State /UT Government.**

      3. **Proxy-Indicators:** Indicators to be used for loss intimation could be rainfall data, other weather indices from WINDS and/or IMD, satellite imagery, Remote sensing indices, drought assessment reports of the MNCFC and crop condition reports by district level/ State Government /UT Administration ofﬁcials, supported by media reports and ﬁeld photographs. The State/UT's notiﬁcation should include all the necessary details and the broad list of indicators to be used in this regard.

      4. ## **Loss Assessment Procedure**

         1. The States/UTs would notify the Crop Calendar indicating crop-wise and agro- climatic zone or district wise cut-off dates by which, this provision could be invoked. However, these dates should not be later than 30 days from the time of onset of sowing period and no later than 15 days from the cut-off date for enrolment of farmer. Beyond this date, this provision shall not be applicable under any circumstance.

         2. The DLMC will recommend invoking of prevented sowing to the State Nodal Department. State/UT Government Notiﬁcation will only be issued by the concerned State Nodal Department after consideration and validation using the available proxy data. Insurance Companies may also provide input to the State/UT in this regard with substantial evidence for consideration within the stipulated time so that claim of Insurance Companies may be veriﬁed by them. If Insurance Companies makes such a case, then the DLMC/State Government/UT Administration is bound to get it examined within a stipulated time of 7 days and in case State Governments/UT Administrations ﬁnds that Prevented Sowing is not applicable then they should inform the Insurance Companies accordingly along with providing cogent reasons and justifications for the same.

         3. If it is felt that the prevailing conditions precedent triggers for invocation of prevented sowing have been breached, the Chairman, DLMC on his/her own accord or on the directions of the State Nodal Department, may convene a meeting of the DLMC wherein the weather/proxy indicator data as indicated in Table 8, **Para 21.3.5.11** shall be presented and discussed. If the Committee ﬁnds a breach of the conditions, then DLMC will issue directions for conducting the joint survey of the crop-wise

   affected insurance units which includes a written notice to concerned Insurance Companies for a Joint Survey. The report of the joint survey will be presented in the DLMC and with the recommendation of DLMC it shall be forwarded to the State Government/UT Administration for validation and issuance of the necessary notiﬁcation for invocation of prevented sowing.

         4. State Governments/UT Administrations would declare the list of notiﬁed IU that suffered Prevented or Failed Sowing/Planting/Germination conditions with approximate areas in percentage of the unit. Such information should be compulsorily uploaded on NCIP to arrive at the Claim amount of eligible insured farmers from the Portal itself.

         5. Peril occurrence notification issued by the State Governments/UT Administrations shall be digitized and integrated with the NCIP to ensure complete visibility of process involved and enabling monitoring of turnaround time taken in loss surveying, claim calculations and settlement process.

         6. For estimation of crop loss in the affected areas, the digital mobile App provided by the GoI shall be compulsorily used by the Insurance Companies, States/UTs and loss surveyors appointed by the concerned Insurance Companies. The roll-out of the mobile app for crop loss assessment surveys shall be notified by the GoI.

         7. The State/UTs implementing YES-TECH for the notified crops, ~~may~~ shall ask the TIPs to submit the Special Report for Prevented Sowing (SR-PS) as mentioned the YES-TECH Manual 2023\.

      5. ## **Conditions**

         1. The cover will be available for major crops covering a total sown area higher than 25% of the total sown area of the District/Taluka or the equivalent unit for the season (refer **Para 7.2.1.1**). Provision of Area Correction Factor (ACF) will not be applicable.

         2. Mere disbursement/sanction of loan without receipt/ debit of premium before the notiﬁcation of calamity won't make a farmer eligible for claim.

         3. This provision has to be notiﬁed by the State/UT Government within 30 days from date of the onset of sowing and no later than 15 days of the cut-off date for enrolment and debit of premium as notified by the State/UT, beyond which the clause cannot be invoked. Insurance Companies will not have any right to press for notification of Preventive Sowing in case the same is not notified by the State/UT Government within above defined timelines and also shall not withhold any future claims for the concerned crops & IUs. Any notification beyond the above referred timelines shall require approval of the GoI before the same is notified by the State/UT.

         4. The Insurance Companies shall disburse the claim within 30 days of the State/UTs Notiﬁcation invoking the event of the insured risk.

         5. The pay-out under the cover would be disbursed by the Insurance Companies only after the receipt of at least advance Government share of premium subsidy (1st tranche of both State/UT Government and the GoI).

         6. Insurance Cover would terminate for the affected crop in a Notiﬁed IU once a claim under this section is invoked and the affected Insurance Unit/ Crop would not be

   eligible for any other add-on and area yield based claim calculated at the end of the season for that crop & Insurance Unit.

         7. Once this provision is invoked, no fresh enrolment of farmers for the affected notiﬁed crops and areas would be done.

         8. Once exigency is invoked it applies to all the insured farmers in the Notiﬁed Insurance Unit for a given crop, including those whose crop survived.

         9. The Bank would remit farmers’ premium to Insurance Companies, with eligible loanee farmers list, within 7 days of the intimation of loss under this section, if not uploaded earlier on Portal. However, this option must be exercised as a last recourse with proper justiﬁcation.

## **Illustration**

10. District ‘B’ with 100 Insurance Units has been affected by a dry-spell at the beginning of crop season, consequently about 80% of the area could not be sown in about 50 Insurance Units for groundnut crop, where per hectare sum insured is Rs. 20,000. As per the provision of payment for prevented sowing, the beneﬁt payable is Sum Insured x 25%, which on a sum insured of Rs.20,000 works out to Rs.5,000/- in the 50 Insurance Units with more than 75% area which could not be sown.

4. ## **On-Account Payment of Claims due to Mid-Season Adversity**

   1. Insurance cover will be provided to the farmers to provide immediate relief in case of adverse seasonal conditions during the crop season viz**. ﬂoods, prolonged dry spells, severe drought etc., between the period from 30 days from start of onset of sowing and up to 15 days before the onset of harvest time, (as per the crop calendar notiﬁed by the States/UT Governments) wherein the expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of Normal Yield**.

      2. ## **Eligibility Criteria**

         1. This add-on cover will only be available if this cover is notiﬁed by the State/UT Government.

         2. All notiﬁed IUs would be eligible for "On-Account" payment only if the expected Yield of the affected crop during the season in those IUs is less than 50% of Normal Yield where normal yield will be determined as an average of immediately preceding 7 years yield data.

         3. The provision could be invoked for a speciﬁc crop or a group of crops in the notiﬁed IU, by the DLMC/State Governments/UT Administrations on the basis of proxy weather indicators supported by the joint loss assessment survey subject to fulﬁlment of the conditions speciﬁed in the OGs.

         4. The quantum of likely losses and the amount of 'On-Account' payment shall be decided based on the joint survey by representatives of IC, District Administration/State Government’s/UT Administration’s Nodal Department and Farmers. In case of dispute/disagreement between the stakeholders regarding the quantum/extent of loss reported by the Joint Loss Assessment committee, the claim calculation will be done using technology derived solutions involving weather and/or remote-sensing indices along with loss assessment surveys with weightage of 70% and 30% respectively for assessment and evaluation of the ﬁnal extent of loss. Acceptance of the technology-based assessment of the extent of loss shall be binding on all stakeholders.

         5. STAC in coordination with respective State Remote Sensing Application Center (SRSAC) or TIP appointed under YES-TECH (for the crops notified under Crop Model Matrix (CMM)) will conduct the crop yield estimation and assessment of potential loss as mentioned in **Para 21.4.2.4** based on the protocol developed by MNCFC. STAC may take help of MNCFC if they desire.

         6. Only those farmers would be eligible for ﬁnancial support under this cover who have paid the premium / the premium has been debited from their account beforethe happening of the mid-season adversity. Banks must ensure to debit farmers premium within 15 days from sanction or renewal of KCC/crop loan of all eligible farmers and well before the cut-off date for debiting the premium to provide beneﬁtof this add on cover.

         7. Amount payable would be 25% of the likely claims subject to adjustment against ﬁnal yield claims based on yield assessment data arrived through CCEs.

         8. **If adversity occurs within a period of 30 days from the start of onset of sowing (as per thecrop calendar/notiﬁed by the State/UTs) and within 15 days before the onset of harvesting, this provision will not be invoked.** For the former case, the losses will be compensated under Prevented Sowing/Failed Germination clause and for the later case, the losses will be paid on the basis of CCE based yield estimation data. State Governments/UT Administrations shall compulsorily notify the district-crop wise onset of sowing and harvesting for notiﬁed crops including multi- picking crops.

         9. Maximum liability is limited to the maximum or balance Sum Insured of the damaged crop's area within insured land parcel and the pay-out under this provision would be in proportion to the loss incurred on the crop in the insured land parcel, up to the occurrence of the insured peril.

         10. Payout under this peril will be as per the payment modalities given in the Annexure- V of these Guidelines.

         11. In case the crop losses are triggered due to multiple events under different or similar covers, the payout under localized calamites shall be calculated as per the modalities described in **Para 21.7, “Claim Settlement under Multiple Events of Similar or Different Perils”,** of the Operational Guidelines.

      3. **Proxy-Indicators:** Indicators to be used for loss intimation could be rainfall data, other weather indices from WINDS and/or IMD, satellite imagery, remote sensing indices, drought assessment reports of MNCFC and crop condition reports by the district level/ State Government /UT Administration ofﬁcials, supported by media reports and ﬁeld photographs. The State's notiﬁcation should also spell out all the necessary details and the broad list of indicators to be used in this regard. A detailed SOP/Manual and modalities for setting up crop-specific weather-parameter triggers as a first level of qualifying mechanism for conducting physical loss assessment surveys shall be notified by the GoI separately.

      4. ## **Loss Assessment Procedure**

         1. The Joint Committee of the State/UT or District Administration/Nodal Department and the Insurer (refer **Para 21.3.5.11**) for the assessment of crop damage have to be formed and notiﬁed before the start of the crop season by the SLCCCI for each district.

         2. When it is perceived that a risk is triggered as deﬁned in the protocol for different indices, viz. Weather, Remote Sensing, Hydrology, Soil Moisture & Insects/ Pest/ Disease impact resulting into mid-term adverse impact on crops and thereby qualifying for on-account payment of claims and if it is felt that the prevailing conditions precedent for invocation of mid-season adversity have been breached, the Chairperson, DLMC on his/her own accord or on the directions of State Nodal Department, as the case may be, convene the meeting of DLMC wherein the weather/proxy indicator data of the indicators as indicated in Table 9 shall be presented and discussed. If the Committee feels that the triggers for invocation of mid-season adversity as mentioned above have been breached, then DLMC will issue directions for convening a meeting of the DLJC for conducting a joint survey of the crop-wise affected insurance unit and written notice may be issued to concerned Insurance Company for the Joint Survey. The report of the joint survey will be presented in the DLMC/DLJC and with the recommendation of DLMC it shall be forwarded to State Governments/UT Administrations for validation and issue of necessary notiﬁcation for invocation of mid-season adversity.

         3. The Joint Committee shall decide the eligibility for mid-term adversity declaration based on the daily weather indices from WINDS and/or IMD (available AWS/ARGs under WINDS notiﬁed by the Government/long term average rainfall data/temperature data), satellite imagery and remote sensing indices, Crop condition, insect/pest/disease impact etc., indicating crop yield losses at notiﬁed IU level.

         4. Based on these parameters, the Joint Committee will assess whether the provision of On-account payment will be invoked and will call for a joint survey. A formal letter has to be issued within 7 days from the adverse seasonal event by the concerned District Administration and District Level Joint Committee for carrying out the joint loss assessment surveys in affected IUs along with a list of such IUs.

         5. Based on the above report, a joint inspection of the affected area shall be done the

   Insurance Company along with the District Administration/Nodal Department ofﬁcials and farmer representatives for ground truth/sample survey using mobile phone App and arrive at the extent of loss by carrying out IU level sample loss surveys.

         6. Information/Services of MITR, MNCFC, ISRO or State/UT specific SRSACs may also be utilized for determination of the extent of loss, using satellite data, for On- Account pay-out.

         7. If the assessed loss of the affected crop assessed through Loss Assessment Surveys is more than 50% of the normal crop yield for the Notiﬁed Insurance Unit,On- Account payment would be payable within 30 days from the date of the invocation of mid-term adversity. It is important that the yield / crop losses estimated for mid- season adversity should be reasonably accurate and should have parity with end of season final crop yield estimates.

         8. The sample surveys for estimation of crop yield loss in the affected IUs shall be conducted using the digital mobile App provided by the GoI, by the States/UT officials and the loss surveyors appointed by the concerned Insurance Companies.

         9. On-Account payment would be calculated as per following formula:

         (*Threshold Yield \- Estimated Yield*)

            *Threshold Yield	× Sum Insured × 25%*

      5. ## **Timeframe for Loss Assessment and Submission of Report**

         1. A formal invocation of mid-season adversity through a formal letter will be issued by the District Administration/Nodal Department of State/UT Government asking to carry out the loss assessment surveys with details of the affected IUs within 7 days from the occurrence of adverse seasonal event.

         2. Loss assessment report at the affected insurance unit level has to be completed by the Joint Committee within 15 days from occurrence of the adverse seasonal event and the loss report should compulsorily be uploaded on NCIP to arrive at the Claim amount of eligible insured farmers from the Portal.

         3. The State/UTs implementing YES-TECH for the notified crops, may ask the TIPs to submit the Special Report for Mid-Season Adversity (SR-MSA) as mentioned the YES-TECH Manual 2023\.

         4. Peril occurrence notification issued by the State Governments/UT Administrations shall also be digitized and integrated with the NCIP to ensure complete visibility of process involved and enabling monitoring of turnaround time taken in loss survey, claim calculations and settlement process.

      6. ## **Conditions**

         1. Mere disbursement/ sanction of loan without receipt/ debit of premium before the notiﬁcation of the calamity would not make a farmer eligible for the claim.

         2. The pay-out under the cover would be disbursed by the Insurance Company only after the receipt of at least advance Government share of premium subsidy (1st tranche of both State/UT and the GoI).

         3. On-Account payment would be paid to all eligible insured farmers within one month of the notiﬁcation invoking this provision by the State/UT Government and subject to receipt of loss assessment report from State/UT Government.

         4. These claims would be adjusted against the end season area approach yield based claims.

         5. Banks would remit farmers' premium to the Insurance Companies, with the farmers list, within 7 days of the intimation of loss under this section, if not uploaded earlier on Portal. However, this option must be exercised as a last recourse with proper justiﬁcation.

### **Illustration**

District 'A' has been affected by ﬂoods having 100 insurance units under Crop 'X'. Out of which 50 insurance units were severely affected and as per the weather indicators / agro-met data, it has been assessed that 30 IUs could have yield loss of more than 50% of the normal yield. Out of these 30 insurance units, estimated yield loss against TY for 5 units is 80% (Category-I), for another 10 units, it is 70% (Category-II) and remaining 15 units, it is 60% (Category-III) of normal yield. As per declarations received, if sum insured for notiﬁed areas in Category-I, Category-II and Category-III is Rs. 1 crore, Rs. 2 crore, and Rs. 3 crore, respectively, then likely total claims will be Rs. 80 lakh, 140 lakh and 180 lakh, respectively. Hence on-account claims upto 25% shall be Rs.20 lakh, 35 lakh and 45 lakh, which will be released during the season subject to receipt of premium subsidy.

*\*Note: Insured Crop Area will be the Actual Insured Area of notified crop in Notified IU in the current seasons as available on NCIP.*

5. ## **Localized Calamity**

   1. The Scheme provides for insurance cover at the individual farm level to crop losses due to occurrence of localized perils/ calamities viz. **hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst and natural ﬁre due to lightening affecting part of a notiﬁed unit or a specific land parcel**.

      2. For the purpose of indemniﬁcation of crop losses due to inundation as localized calamity, Inundation is a situation where insured ﬁeld is covered or submerged by water due to the rise in water level by natural rainfall or from an artesian well or ﬂood water from local water bodies and where water stays for a prolonged period and causes visible damage to the crop.

      3. However, this is subject to conﬁrmation of the damage in the joint survey to be conducted by the State/UT Government representative and Insurance Company in presence of the concerned farmer. The States/UTs shall notify the crops to be included under localized calamity losses along with the crop calendar in the Bid Document and Notiﬁcation (as per **Para 7.3**) on the NCIP. The crops not falling under the aforesaid category/not included in the tender shall not be included later for localized calamity loss cover.

      4. ## **Eligibility Criteria**

         1. This add-on cover will only be available if this cover is notiﬁed by the State/UT Government.

         2. Available to all insured farmers, at farm unit level, affected by above mentioned perils in a Notiﬁed IU growing notiﬁed crops for which insurance has been availed.

         3. Available for all notiﬁed crops which have been declared eligible for localized calamity losses as per the State/UT Government notiﬁcation and damaged by speciﬁed perils during when the crop is in standing condition up till harvesting.

         4. Only those farmers would be eligible for ﬁnancial support under this cover who have paid the premium i.e. the premium has been debited from their account before the occurrence of the insured peril.

         5. Maximum liability is limited to the maximum or balance Sum Insured of the damaged crop's area within insured land parcel and the pay-out under this provision would be in proportion to the loss incurred on the crop in the insured land parcel, up to the occurrence of the insured peril.

         6. Payout under this peril will be as per the payment modalities given in the Annexure- V of these Guidelines.

         3. Weather data report from the WINDS network, Mid-season report (MSR) under YES- TECH), IMD reports, Media reports, Local Newspaper cuttings to substantiate occurrence of loss event and severity of the loss, if any.

      7. ## **Appointment of Loss Assessors by the Insurance Company**

         1. The loss assessors would be appointed by the Insurance Company for assessment of losses due to incidence of Localized Calamities. The loss assessors appointed by the Insurance Companies should be in accordance with the IRDAI provisions. The loss assessors appointed should possess following experience and qualiﬁcation:

* Diploma/degree in any subject with a minimum of 2 years relevant experience or bachelor’s degree in agriculture and allied subjects with one year experience.

* Retired Bank ofﬁcials with experience of Agriculture Value Chain financing or Kisan Credit Card (KCC).

  2. For compliance under the above provisions the Insurance Companies would utilize the empaneled loss assessors for using their services as and when required.

     3. The loss would be jointly assessed by a team comprising of loss assessor appointed by the insurer, block level agriculture ofﬁcer, primary worker of the agriculture or revenue department and the concerned farmer. Loss assessment surveys shall be conducted by the Joint Committee, at each individual ﬁeld level, through the Mobile App specifically developed for the same by the GoI. The loss assessment data shall be uploaded on the NCIP on a real time basis to arrive at the Claim amount of the eligible insured farmers.

     8. ## **Time frame for Loss Assessment and Submission of the Report**

1. Appointment of loss assessor within 48 hours.

2. Loss assessment to be completed within the next 10 days.

3. Claim settlement to be completed in next 15 days (subject to receipt of farmers’ premium& ﬁrst instalment of Subsidy).

   Maximum liability would be limited to maximum or balance Sum Insured of the damaged cropped area within insured land parcel and the pay-out under this provision would be in proportion to the loss incurred on the crop in the insured land parcel, up to the occurrence of the insured peril. Intimation of crop losses is compulsory for individual insured farmers through various channels in case of losses due to speciﬁed localized calamities. If the intimation of crop losses due to speciﬁed localized calamities is received by the State Governments/UT Administrations, then they will enter the data of intimations of crop losses in a form that can be uploaded in the KRPH and provide the same to Insurance Company along with copies of the intimations received. The Insurance Company shall reconcile the total intimations data by comparing with the number of insured farmers in a notiﬁed insurance unit.

   If the insured area in an IU with loss intimations as compared to the total insured area for that particular crop in the IU is less than 25%, then an individual survey of all the farmers shall have to necessarily be done. This assessment shall have to be done for each insured crop-land parcel individually in the IU.

   **Wide-spread Localized Calamity:** If the Insured area under loss intimation under localized calamity claims in an IU is more than 25% of the total Insured area in the IU during a specific weather event having a single/similar peril, then the event shall be considered as Wide-spread Localized calamity and the sample loss survey will be conducted at 10 different randomly selected crop-land parcels using the loss intimation list across the affected Insurance Unit and average loss %age basis the sample survey shall be applicable to all intimations for the given IU during the specific weather event. In this case, the losses will not be considered as individual and will be presumed widespread. Therefore, the claims shall be disbursed to all eligible insured farmers (who have given intimation/for whom intimation has been received/accepted) in accordance with the crop loss assessment arrived at following the below tabular grid. **Accordingly, loss assessment and claim disbursement shall be done as per below:**

   (*Average Area Affected %age X Average Crop Loss %*) 𝑿 *Sum Insured X 25%*

   For the purpose of defining the weather event, loss of or damage to the insured crop under PMFBY arising from a single weather peril active during any given period shall be deemed as a single event until there is a break in continuity of occurrence of the same peril for 72 consecutive hours, i.e. if there is not a break of more than 72 hours

   between events under a similar peril, such events shall be considered as a single event for calculation of event period.

4. The tentative sample size would be as under:

| Intimation (affected area against Insured ar notiﬁed crop) | Survey |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Less than 25%** | All Intimations would be surveyed |
| **\>25%** | Sample survey at IU crop level as per mid-season Adversity provisions |

   9. ## **Conditions**

      1. Mere disbursement/sanction of a loan without receipt/debit of premium before the occurrence of insured peril would not make a farmer eligible for the claim.

         2. When the affected area is limited up to 25% of the total insured area for the season, in the notiﬁed insurance unit, the losses of eligible farmers would be assessed individually provided they have intimated and paid premium prior to occurrence of insurance peril. The intimation is a pre-condition to get beneﬁt for the localized claim. Intimations received during the survey would also be considered.

         3. If the affected area under a notiﬁed crop is more than 25% of the total insured area in a notiﬁed insurance unit, all the eligible farmers who have taken insurance for the notiﬁed crop, which has been damaged, and informed about the occurrence of a calamity in the individual insured farm/land parcel within the stipulated time in the notiﬁed Insurance Unit (IU), would be deemed to have suffered localized loss and would be eligible for ﬁnancial support under localized calamity loss. The percentage of loss would be arrived at by Insurance Company through a requisite number of sample survey as deﬁned in the detailed protocol for the add-on cover.

         4. The eligibility of claim settlement shall be decided based on the outcome of joint loss assessment surveys carried out by representatives of Insurance Company, District Administration/State Government’s/UT Administration’s Nodal Department and Farmers. Further if the affected area is more than 25% of the total insured area and there is dispute / disagreement between the stakeholders regarding the quantum/extent of loss reported by the Joint Loss Assessment committee, **the claim calculation will be done using technology derived solutions involving weather and/or remote-sensing indices along with loss assessment surveys with a weightage of 70% and 30% respectively for assessment and evaluation of the ﬁnal extent of loss**. Acceptance of the technology-driven extent of loss will be binding on all stakeholders.

         5. STAC in coordination with State Remote Sensing Application Centre or TIP appointed under YES-TECH (for the crops notified under Crop Model Matrix (CMM)) will conduct yield estimation and assessment of loss as mentioned in **Para 21.5.9.4** based on the protocol developed by MNCFC. STAC may take the help of MNCFC if they desire.

         6. The pay-out under the cover would be disbursed by the Insurance Company only after the receipt of at least advance Government share of premium subsidy (1st instalment of both State/UT and the GoI).

         7. The Insurance Company would disburse the claim, if payable within 15 days of survey

   of loss.

         8. Farmers getting enrolled or whose premium is debited after the occurrence of insurance peril or data has not been uploaded on NCIP would not be eligible for ﬁnancial support under this cover.

For the purpose of defining the weather event, loss of or damage to the insured crop under PMFBY arising from a single weather peril active during any given period shall be deemed as a single event until there is a break in continuity of occurrence of the same peril for 72 consecutive hours, i.e. if there is not a break of more than 72 hours between events under a similar peril, such events shall be considered as a single event for calculation of event period.

9. The tentative sample size would be as under:

| Intimation (Insured area under notiﬁed crop) | Survey |
| ----- | ----- |
| Less than 25% | All Intimations would be surveyed |
| \>25% | Sample survey at IU crop level as per mid- season Adversity provisions |

10. ## **Conditions**

    1. Mere disbursement/sanction of loan without the receipt/debit of premium before the occurrence of insured peril would not make a farmer eligible for a claim.

       2. When affected area is limited up to 25% of the total insured area for the season in the notiﬁed insurance unit, the losses of eligible farmers would be assessed individually provided they have paid the premium prior to the occurrence of an insurance peril. Intimation is a pre-condition to get the beneﬁt for localized claim. Intimations received during the time of survey would also be considered.

          3. If the affected area under a notiﬁed crop is more than 25% of the total insured area in a notiﬁed insurance unit, all the eligible farmers who have taken insurance for the notiﬁed crop, which has been damaged, and informed about the occurrence of a calamity in the individual insured farm/land parcel within the stipulated time in the notiﬁed Insurance Unit (IU), would be deemed to have suffered localized loss and would be eligible for ﬁnancial support under post-harvest loss. The percentage of loss would be arrived at by Insurance Company through a requisite number of sample survey as deﬁned in the detailed protocol for the add-on cover.

          4. The eligibility of claim settlement shall be decided based on the outcome of the joint loss assessment surveys carried out by representatives of the Insurance Company, District Administration/State Government’s/UT Administration’s nodal department and farmers. Further if affected area is more than 25% of the total insured area and there is dispute or disagreement between the stakeholders regarding the quantum or extent of the loss reported by the Joint Loss Assessment committee, **the claim calculation will be done using technology derived solutions involving weather/remote-sensing indices along with the loss assessment surveys with weightage of 70% and 30% respectively, for assessment and evaluation of ﬁnal extent of loss. The acceptance of the technology driven extent of loss will be binding on all stakeholders.**

          5. STAC in coordination with State Remote Sensing Application Centre or TIP appointed under YES-TECH (for the crops notified under Crop Model Matrix (CMM)) will conduct assessment of loss as mentioned in **Para 21.6.10.4** based on the protocol developed by MNCFC or mentioned in YES-TECH manual, as the case maybe. STAC may take the help of MNCFC if they desire.

          6. The pay-out under the cover would be disbursed by the Insurance Company only after the receipt of 2nd tranche of the Government share of premium subsidy (both the State/UT Government and the GoI Share).

          7. The Insurance Company would disburse the claim, if payable, within 15 days of the receipt of the loss survey report.

          8. Farmers getting enrolled or whose premium is debited after the occurrence of

    insurance peril or data has not been uploaded on NCIP would not be eligible for ﬁnancial support under this cover.

       11. ## **Detailed Procedure and Timelines for Payment of Post-Harvest Loss is Mentioned in Table 11 below:**

| Sl. No. | Action required to be taken | Action to be taken by | Schedule for taking action |
| ----- | :---- | ----- | :---- |

|  | The individual crop losses due to occurrence of localized perils within 15 days of onset of harvest will be treated as Post-harvest Losses provided that the said crop has been notified for Post-harvest Loss cover. However, if the crop has been harvested prior to the onset of harvest and if the crop has been cut and is lying on the field in such cases the calamity would fall under the post-harvest losses provided the said crop has been notified for the post-harvest cover and it would only be considered for crops which are required to be kept on the field for drying up maximum for a period |  |  |

| Sl. No. | Action required to be taken | Action to be taken by | Schedule for taking action |
| ----- | :---- | ----- | :---- |

|  8 | Data of the Loss assessment report ﬁnalized by DLJC, and admissible claims will be uploaded on the NCIP  against  the  farmer  from whom loss intimation was received. |  Insurance company |  Within 7 days of the Survey. |

### **Protocol for Area based Assessment: If affected area\>25% of total insured Area**

| Sl. No. | Action required to be taken | Action to be taken by | Schedule for taking action |
| ----- | :---- | ----- | :---- |
|  1 | Fulﬁllment of eligibility of post- harvest losses on area-based loss assessment (i.e. affected area is \>25% of the total insured crop area) is to be decided based on the occurrence of any one of the Proxy Indicators:- Wide-spread unseasonal/excess rainfall. Wide-spread cyclones/cyclonic rains. Wide-spread hailstorm/hailing. Losses impacting \> 25% of the insured crop area\*. Supported by Satellite Image and Satellite Index based outputs to be provided by MITR, ISRO/SAC, MNCFC or MITR’s under YES-TECH, Government crop condition reports, and media reports, etc. |  DLJC |  Deﬁnitions & interpretations of proxy indicators would be applied as per IMD's guidelines as below:  %age w.r.t. LPA.  Abnormal Weather Parameter: (±) 20 or more deviation than the Long Period Average. |
|  2 |  Keeping watch over the breaching of set triggers of proxy indicators as mentioned above. Meeting of the DLJC to be convened on the breaching of any one of the above triggers of unseasonal rainfall, cyclone or cyclonic rainfall and hailstorm/hailing. |  District Agriculture / Horticulture / Revenue Ofﬁcer (i.e. convener of DLJC). | Meeting of the DLJC to be convened. Relevant data to be placed before the Committee. The decision should be taken within 7 days from the occurrence of adverse seasonal	event \&communicated through a letter for conducting loss assessment surveys in the listed IUs. |
|  3 | Physical loss assessment survey to be carried out for at least   the   sample   size (mentioned in **Para 21.6.8**). |  To be done by DLJC. | Within 15 days of the letter received for carrying out the loss assessment surveys by the DLJC. |
|  4 |  Dispute/Disagreement raised by any stakeholder on the process of Loss Assessment Survey or Extent of assessed loss. |  Any Stakeholder | Written notice within 7 days to be submitted to the Chairman- DLMC with proofs/data/reports substantiating the claim. The DLMC to review the reports/evidence and resolve the dispute within 7 days. In case the dispute is unresolved, the affected stakeholder can make an appeal to State Nodal Department, thereafter to STAC, as per the process deﬁned in the Grievance Redressal mechanism. |
| 5 | Assessment of likely losses and ﬁnalization of claims payment | Insurance Company | Within one month from the date of the DLJC letter to carry |

| Sl. No. | Action required to be taken | Action to be taken by | Schedule for taking action |
| ----- | :---- | ----- | :---- |
|  | based on the joint survey. |  | out the loss assessment surveys subject to receipt of full Government share of subsidy (2nd tranche of both the State/UT Government and the GoI). |
|  6 |  Payment to eligible farmers. |  |  |
|  7 | Data of loss assessment ﬁnalized by DLJC and admissible claims will be uploaded on the NCIP against farmer  from  whom  loss intimation has been received. |  Insurance Company |  Within 7 days of the survey. |

*\*Note3: If affected area is more than 25% of the insured area of notiﬁed crop in notiﬁed insurance unit then the losses are not eligible as individual and are presumed to be widespread, therefore claim to all eligible insured farmers (who have given intimation/for whom intimation has been received) would be paid ad-hoc.*

## **Illustration**

* A \- Sum Insured for a crop=Rs.30,000

* B \- % area affected out of the total area insured \= 100%

* C \- %crop loss estimated in affected area basis joint physical survey \= 80%

* D \- Claims payable \= A x B x C \= Rs. 30,000 x 100% x 80% \= Rs. 24,000/-

  7. ## **Claim Settlement under Multiple Events of Similar or Different Perils**

     1. There have been instances of multiple perils happening over the course of a crop season in an IU, or simultaneously during the crop harvesting window affecting same crop-land parcel or application, leading to complexities in damage assessment and claim calculation. Accordingly, the detailed modalities of claim assessment and settlement in case of multiple events being triggered under similar or different perils are described below.

     2. The claim events under PMFBY (including RWBCIS) have been divided into three wider categories on the basis of approach and applicability of these events:

1. Wide-Spread Events with Policy Termination feature \--- Preventive Sowing/Failed Germination

2. Individual Events — Localized Calamity and Post-Harvest losses

3. Wide Spread Events — Mid Season Adversity and Yield Based losses

   3. In the event that the Claims for a same crop-Land parcel or application are triggered under different types of coverages viz., Localized Calamities, Mid-season adversity, post-harvest losses and final yield based claim (Basic Cover), then the final claim assessment shall be done by either adjusting the claims in case of identical covers or by reducing the sum insured in case the claims are triggered under different types of covers.

      4. In case multiple events affecting same crop-Land parcel or application are triggered under the identical covers, differential claim amount will be paid without reducing the

   Sum Insured. i.e., the Sum Insured will remain intact, and the claims will be adjusted against the previous paid claim with the principle that highest payable claim shall be paid at any given point in time. The different scenarios are given below:

1. In case of multiple localized calamity events,

2. A combination of widespread events:

   * Mid-season adversity and Yield-Based Claim (Basic Cover)

   * A combination of Mid-season adversity, Wide-Spread Localized Calamities and Yield-Based Claim (Basic Cover).

     5. In case of multiple claim events are triggered under different covers in combinations other than those specified above, then the available sum insured for the subsequent perils would be derived by reducing the amount of claim already paid in the preceding loss event. Accordingly, the claim under the subsequent event shall be calculated on balance left-out Sum Insured only. The different scenarios are given below:

1. Localized Calamity events and Yield-Based Claim,

2. Yield-Based Claims and Post-Harvest losses,

3. Localized Calamity and Post-Harvest losses

4. Localized Calamity and Mid-Season Adversity,

5. Mid-season Adversity and Post-Harvest Losses

   6. After the initial event the balance Sum Insured for any given application only shall be utilized to ascertain the payable claims in future events using the above modality. The final yield-based claim under the Basic Cover, therefore, shall be computed based on Yield shortfall multiplied by available balance of Sum Insured at the stage of final yield-based claim settlement.

      7. Under **Para 21.7.2 (A)** above, where the clause of Preventive Sowing/Failed Germination is triggered, the insurance cover will cease to exist and therefore there is no possibility of any further claims, whereas under **Para 21.7.2 (B) & (C),** the interplay can happen more than once within same IU for same crop & season. Accordingly, the eligibility and claims shall be calculated and paid by the concerned Insurance Companies as defined in **Para 21.7.3 to 21.7.6** above. A multi-event claim calculation flowchart is appended below for more clarity. Further detailed illustration of the same is placed at **Annexure-V** of these Operational Guidelines.

      8. **Multi-Event Multi-Peril Claim Calculation Flowchart:**

22. ## **Participation of Loss Assessors/Evaluators for Loss Assessment under the Scheme**

    1. **Empanelment Criteria**

       1. The agencies having relevant ﬁeld experience, ﬁnancial and infrastructural strength, sufﬁcient skilled manpower having diploma in any subject with minimum 2 years of relevant experience or a Bachelor’s Degree in Agriculture and allied subjects with one year relevant experience in rural/crop insurance, crop loss assessment and having desired operational capabilities shall be empaneled by the GoI as a Loss

    Assessment Agency.

       2. Once loss assessment agency has been empaneled by the GoI, it will be considered as a pre-qualiﬁed company to participate and engage with the concerned State/UT Government and Insurance Companies to undertake loss assessment under the provisions of the Scheme, however concerned agency will be responsible for maintaining the quality of services being delivered by them.

       3. Once empaneled, the performance of such agencies will be evaluated every season against vital parameters defined in the monitoring and evaluation framework notified by the GoI and the non-performing agencies shall be de-empaneled for a period of

    2 consecutive seasons. The de-empaneled agency shall be required to get empaneled again to provide the services under the scheme.

       4. Detailed guidelines for the empanelment and accreditation of loss assessment agencies shall be prepared and notified by the GoI separately. These guidelines will enable empanelment and de-empanelment of agencies based on set performance parameters to maintain desired quality and standardization of protocols and processes related to crop loss assessment.

       5. As loss assessment is a vital activity under the Scheme and forms the basis of claims settlement, any malpractice, manipulation or misreporting is non-acceptable and shall be taken very seriously. Accordingly, an appropriate legal and administrative action shall be taken against the agencies and individuals associated with such agencies. Loss assessment agencies shall follow the guidelines issued by the GoI while engaging in PMFBY implementation.

       6. In order to develop the capacity of the loss assessment agencies and to create a large pool of Certified Crop Loss Assessors (CCLAs) at national level, GoI shall design a LMS based open online course/certification for crop loss assessors. The individual loss assessors employed by the loss assessment agencies shall mandatorily complete this certification before conducting loss assessment surveys under PMFBY.

       7. The loss assessment agencies shall be provided with a transition period of One/Two Years to create a pool of Certified Crop Loss Assessors (CCLA), after which the Loss assessment agencies shall mandatorily employ or engage the CCLAs only, for crop loss assessment under PMFBY.

23. ## **Procedure for Settlement of Claims to the Farmers**

    1. The Insurance Company should have received the ﬁnal share of Government subsidy (2nd tranche), both Central and State, on the basis of the enrollment data basis the applications approved on the NCIP to enable the settlement of Actual Yield-based claims arising out of wide-spread calamity as well as post-harvest losses. However, for the settlement of payment of claims under add-on covers viz. MSA & Localized Calamities, advance subsidy (1st tranche) of 50% of the advance upfront premium subsidy of the Central and the State Governments/UT Administrations based on the corresponding previous season’s premium or current season’s premium as the case may be as per **Para 6.1.7** of the operational guidelines shall be sufficient to pay the claims.

    2. State Governments/UT Administrations shall compulsorily upload the Threshold

    Yield and Actual Yield data for all Crop-IUs on NCIP for all notiﬁed crops which shall also be veriﬁed and accepted by the concerned Insurance Company within the given timelines**. In order to avoid manipulation or misuse of the information at ﬁeld level, Threshold Yield values for the Crop-IU and season shall never be shared publicly by the State/UT or primary worker or Insurance Company with anyone and this information shall never be a part of public information before the payment of yield-based claims for that season**.

    3. The DLMC will be required to upload or enter the details of crop loss as per the Joint Loss Survey conducted by DLJC for all intermediate loss events viz. prevented sowing/planting/germination failure \&Mid-season Adversity on the NCIP. Similarly, the crop loss details for localized losses and post-harvest loss events shall be entered by the concerned Insurance Company on the Portal. Once the Actual Yield data is available on the NCIP, the same shall be veriﬁed and approved by the concerned District and State authorities in sequence. For those experiments which were conducted ofﬂine and without the use of mobile application, the Actual Yield data shall also be uploaded by the concerned District administration on NCIP which subsequently shall be approved by the State/UT nodal department on the NCIP itself. **All the estimations of Yield and crop loss assessments shall be uploaded within the stipulated timeline on the NCIP by the concerned stakeholders as envisaged above. The admissible claims shall be calculated on the NCIP. The status of claim payment and the claim amount shall accordingly be made available on NCIP for stakeholders to track and validate**.

    4. The loss reports and Actual Yield data shall be approved or reverted (in case of any discrepancy or /concern on the authenticity and correctness of the report and data) by the Insurance Company. Based on the loss reports of add-on claims and actual yield data, eligible claims shall be calculated through the NCIP and accordingly the payment of claims shall be initiated by the concerned Insurance Company and remitted directly into the beneﬁciary account as per the pre-deﬁned process and timelines using the PFMS platform developed for initiating financial transactions. The application-wise payment details viz. amount, reference number, date etc. shall be synchronized with the National Crop Insurance Portal for future reference & reconciliation.

    5. In case of wide-spread calamity (end of season claims), once yield data is ﬁnalized and received from the State/UT Government as per the decided cut-off-dates and is uploaded, approved and accepted on NCIP, claims shall be calculated on the NCIP for approved applications in each notiﬁed area and crops as available on NCIP. Accordingly, the claims will be approved by the Competent Authority of the implementing Insurance Company and all claims will be initiated through Public Financial Management System (PFMS) platform developed for initiating financial transactions. The application-wise payment details viz. Amount, Reference Number, Date etc. shall be synchronized with the NCIP for validation, audit and future reference purposes.

    6. In case the CCE data submitted through CCE Agri App is not approved within the stipulated timelines, it will be auto- approved and used for claim calculation. In case of non-submission of Actual Yield (AY) data by the State/UT Government to the implementing insurance companies within the stipulated timelines, Synthetic Yield data computed through technology-based solutions shall be used for calculating admissible claims and subsequent settlement of claims to the eligible farmers. The

    cut-off date for submission of yield data to insurance companies is normally two months after completion of harvesting of a particular crop.

    7. In case of farmers (loanee) covered by ﬁnancial Institutions, claims shall be released only electronically through NCIP using PFMS platform directly into insured farmer's given loan or saving bank account. The claim settlement details shall also be available on NCIP for the individual Bank Branches and Nodal Banks to access and validate. Bank Branch should spread awareness and motivation amongst farming community to opt for enrollment under the scheme. In case of failure of claim remittance due to earlier account number being wrong, the applications shall be enabled for the concerned bank branch for updating the correct or new bank account details of the farmer and accordingly the claims shall be initiated into new account number as per process defined above. For the closed accounts or failure of claims in updated account numbers, the claims shall be initiated through Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) directly into Aadhaar ceded bank account number of beneficiary farmer.

    8. In case of farmers (non-loanee) covered through Insurance intermediaries or CSC or any other enrollment channel, Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) shall be used mandatorily as primary mode of payment of claims directly into Aadhaar ceded bank account number of beneficiary farmer through NCIP using PFMS platform. In case of failure of claim remittance using AEPS, the claims shall be initiated in the saving bank account entered on NCIP at the time of enrollment. In case of failure of claim remittance into bank account and through AEPS, the applications shall be enabled for the concerned Insurance Companies for updating the correct or new bank account details of the farmer and accordingly the claims shall be initiated into new bank account number as per process defined above.

    9. For change of account numbers, a certificate/declaration shall be required to be submitted by the concerned farmer to the Insurance Company containing the revised and updated banking details and being the rightful recipient of the claims.

    10. In case of demise or the insured farmer, the applications shall be enabled for the concerned Insurance Companies for updating the new bank account details of the legal heir of the insured farmer and accordingly the applicable claim amount shall be initiated by the Insurance Company to the legal heir of the insured farmer subject to submission of legal heir certificate and certificate/declaration by the legal heir of the insured farmer about rightful recipient of the claim amount and containing the relevant banking details.

    11. In case the eligible claims could not be remitted by the Insurance Company to the concerned insured farmer during 6 consecutive seasons despite due attempts and efforts have been made to trace the farmer & collect banking details, the said claim amount shall be remitted to the FIAT account maintained by GoI. Further, in the previous years, a special dispensation was given by GoI to the States to open the Escrow Accounts to pool all such claim funds from Insurance Companies which could not be remitted into the loan/saving bank account or Aadhaar seeded accounts of eligible beneficiaries. In case there are unclaimed/accumulated funds in these Escrow accounts for immediately preceding 6 seasons which could not be remitted to their rightful beneficiaries despite due attempts and efforts have been made to trace the farmer & collect banking details, such funds along with accumulated interest shall also be remitted to FIAT fund maintained by GoI,

    12. In case of claims under prevented/failed sowing, localized calamities, post-harvest losses; Insurance Company will process the claims after assessment and shall release the claims as per detailed procedure given in the relevant sections above.

    13. The claim settlement intimation shall be sent to each beneﬁciary farmer through SMS initiated through NCIP and an intimation through Chatbot platform shall also be initiated to the farmers. State Governments/UT Administrations, CSCs, Banks & Insurance Companies shall ensure the accuracy of the data beforehand viz. Threshold Yield, Actual Yield, Insured Area, Sum Insured and Indemnity levels etc. Responsibility of any error, omissions and misreporting shall lie with the concerned State Nodal Department, Banks, CSCs and Insurance Companies as per their relevant roles and responsibilities defined under these Operational Guidelines. State Governments/UT Administrations, Banks, CSC-VLEs and Insurance Companies shall resolve all the grievances of the insured farmers and other stakeholders in the shortest possible time.

    14. In any situation, the State/UT Government cannot reopen or re-calculate already assessed and disbursed claims after 30 days from the time of claim settlement for the notiﬁed crop(s) at the notiﬁed insurance unit. However, all States/UTs may compulsorily audit the calculation and payment of claims to the eligible farmers at the earliest and complete the process within One Month. In the case of disputed or sub-standard claims, due to erroneous data, the matter may be referred to State Level Coordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI) or STAC within this time and further to the central Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), if required, for consideration and appropriate decision.

    15. All the details of the farmers pertaining to payment of claims shall be veriﬁed through PFMS before initiating the claim payment on NCIP. Applications with invalidated bank accounts and Aadhaar Numbers shall be enabled for re-entry of account numbers as per the process defined above.

    16. The State/UT may define the minimum claim amount per farmer as threshold for all the seasons below which the claims shall be held back by the insurance companies. The claims above this threshold amount may be disbursed directly to the farmers’ account. The State/UTs may exercise any one of the following options and inform GoI regarding the same well before the timelines for initiating the claims for the season:

        1. Option 1 – The amount below the defined threshold may be transferred to FIAT account maintained by the GoI.

        2. Option 2 – The State/UTs may top-up the actual claim amount from their own budget to meet the defined minimum threshold.

        3. Option 3 \- The State/UTs may retain the claim amount below the defined threshold and add to the claim amount of the same farmer in the next season(s).

24. ## **Important Conditions/ Clauses Applicable for Coverage of Risks**

    1. Insurance Companies shall receive the premium for coverage either from the bank, channel partner, CSC-VLE, insurance intermediary or directly. In case of any error in data entry or non-entry of relevant data on NCIP due to negligence by these agencies or non-remittance of premium by these agencies, the concerned agency

    shall be liable for payment of eligible claims.

    2. **In case of any substantial misreporting by nodal bank /branch with respect to** loanee farmers coverage which may include incorrect insured and sown acreage and survey number details, bank account details & IU details etc., the concerned bank only shall be liable for such misreporting.

    3. Mere sanctioning/disbursement of crop loans and the submission of relevant data on NCIP and remittance of premium by the farmer or bank, without explicit intent to raise the crop or without having raised the said crop on the insured land parcel, shall not mean eligibility of such farmer for coverage under the scheme and also shall not constitute acceptance of risk by the concerned Insurance Company.

    4. The acceptance of risk and payment of claims by Insurance Company shall be purely based on the provisions of these Guidelines and no other guidelines or modalities of any other scheme of Central/State/UT Government or terms and conditions of any other product of Insurance Companies shall be referred to or adopted by the States/UTs or Insurance Companies.

25. ## **Acreage Discrepancy**

    1. Some areas across the country in the past have reported excess insurance coverage vis-à-vis planted or sown acreage, leading to over-insurance. Any discrepancy in coverage of excess area should be handled at the individual unique applicant level to protect the interest of farmers with genuine insurance coverage. All suitable measures shall be taken by concerned stakeholders for de-duplication with the help of Aadhaar Number, land records including State/UT specific digital land record platforms and data validation from Agri-stack system of the GoI, banks records, revenue records and KCC loan application of insured farmers against the details of individual insured farmers as available on NCIP. Integration of digitized land records with the NCIP is ongoing to resolve the problem of multiple coverage or excess coverage on the same parcel of land. Any misreporting in acreage will be veriﬁed and validated by the concerned Insurance Companies with the Digital land record portals of the States/UTs and the same can also be verified from the concerned bank branches in case of loanee farmers .The scheme also covers the risk of prevented sowing/germination failure which is not included in the final sowing area furnished by the State/UT Government for arriving at end of season sown area of respective crops during the season. Hence, the comparison of insured coverage without removing prevented sowing/germination failure acreage with the final season end sown area is not justiﬁable. However, misreporting of area insured or misrepresentation of, non-cultivable or Govt./Temple land or cultivable land not belonging to the insured farmer, as owned or leased land or farmers not sowing or having no intention of raising the crop in the insured land parcel etc. should be veriﬁed, de-duplicated and eliminated from the final coverage. For the purpose of elimination of duplicate applications (application on same land parcel for same crop and area for same farmer), the application enrolled though Banks as loanee farmers shall get precedence over non-loanee application enrolled through any other channel and therefore non-loanee application/s shall get rejected first. In case of multiple enrolments either though banks as loanee farmer and/or non-loanee farmers and non-loanee farmers through same or multiple channels, the LIFO principle shall be applied, i.e. applications which has been enrolled last shall be rejected first. The State/UT Government along with the District administration and

    the Insurance Company should take appropriate measures for veriﬁcation of land/area sown at ground level. The Scheme also provides for the option to change the insured crop by the insured farmers upto 2 days before the cut-off date for debit of premium and enrollment of farmers. Hence, Bank Branches and other agencies may publicize this provision adequately along with the consequences of over insurance and malpractices in advance amongst the farmers.

    2. The Insurance Companies should also verify sufﬁcient number of insured land parcels for each notiﬁed major crop by visiting those Insured ﬁelds and report the same though mobile app to the GoI.

    3. Under the scheme, notiﬁed crops are being insured by the Insurance Companies on the basis of actuarial premium rate by sufficiently pricing the underlying risk, hence, it is not their prerogative to reduce the Sum Insured and resultant claims on the application of ACF. However, to rationalize the government subsidy, it is the responsibility of all concerned stakeholders including farmers and ﬁnancial institutions to insure the crop which the farmer actually intends to sow or is actually sown and to the extent of actual sown area. The option to change the insured crop has also been provided under the scheme for reporting of crop(s) actually sown. There is also a provision to indemnify the crop losses due to the localized perils on the basis of a survey of individual land parcels under insured crops. Incorrect reporting of insured crops i.e. if the crop actually sown and insured are different, may lead to forfeiting of premium and rejection of application leading to denial of claims.

    4. Any case of large-scale irregularities or anomalies regarding insurance of excess area i.e. the insured area being more than the published sown area (i.e., the average of the last three consecutive years) at Taluka level should compulsorily be brought to the notice of the State/UT Government and the GoI.

    5. In spite of all suitable measures taken by the Insurance Company for de-duplication and elimination of ghost farmers or identification of excess area insured by the individual farmers, all Insurance Companies have to necessarily report excess insured area in the prescribed template to the concerned States/UT and GoI well before the start of crop cutting experiments for veriﬁcation of the issues raised by the concerned Insurance Companies and for taking necessary corrective measures, if required. It is the responsibility of the Insurance Company to verify the sown area before the time prescribed for auto-approval of application. In case of any ﬁnancial loss incurred by the Government in respect to subsidy claimed against the non- genuine or ghost applications, the Insurance Company shall be liable for making the refund of Government subsidy premium, forfeiture of farmer’s premium and depositing it to FIAT account maintained by the GoI. The decision for application of ACF will be taken by the GoI based on the ﬁeld reports submitted by Insurance Company, thorough evaluation of the situation and the decision of the GoI in regard to the applicability of discrepancy in insured area shall be binding on all. The template for such reporting is given in **Annexure-II.**

26. ## **Information Education & Communication (IEC) and Capacity Building**

    1. Information, Education and Communication (IEC) and Capacity Building activities through awareness drives, campaigns, trainings and handholding support are the focus areas under revamped PMFBY. It is imperative to create awareness about PMFBY amongst farmers and bridge knowledge gaps among various implementing stakeholders. As Insurance Companies are being allocated continuity of business for long term i.e., for three years, they will have adequate time for awareness generation and building capacities of the different stakeholders. Therefore, systematic management of IEC and training activities is essential for a scheme like PMFBY, where multiple stakeholders are involved at various stages of scheme implementation. The primary target groups for conducting IEC and training and capacity building activities are farmers, State level and district level ofﬁcials of the State Governments/UT Administrations, Banks, Primary Agriculture Co-operative societies (PACS), Common Service Centers (CSCs)-VLEs, Insurance Intermediaries, ﬁeld functionaries and primary workers of different departments and implementing Insurance Companies.

    2. Major challenge in creating well informed ecosystem is the multiple layers of hierarchy within each stakeholder and their different levels of understanding about scheme implementation aspects. Thus, IEC and training needs of the stakeholders are not uniform but vary in its functional areas. Since, different stakeholders represent PMFBY to the farmers, any deﬁciency in the knowledge or services greatly

    impacts the understanding and adoption of the scheme by the farmers, implementation of scheme as per the protocols, understanding of different technology aspects infused under the scheme and eventually the claim settlement process. Since, the scheme has been made voluntary for all the farmers, it becomes even more important to generate awareness about the beneﬁts of the scheme, build trust in the scheme and make efforts for ensuring faster and efficient service delivery to the farmers to improve overall satisfaction amongst them, thus instilling behavioral change towards creating an enabling environment in favor of the concept of risk protection through insurance. Therefore, a robust awareness and capacity building platform has great signiﬁcance in streamlining and strengthening scheme implementation.

    3. It requires sensitization of higher authorities of the targeted stakeholders at the National, State/UT, & district level, massive awareness generation and error free implementation at the ground level throughout the season. It equally requires focus on awareness and education of all stakeholders including farmers about all implementation aspects of the scheme, right from scheme publicity, enrolment of farmers, yield & loss assessment, claim calculation, claim settlement and addressing grievances of farmers. Broad objective of IEC and capacity building is to build overall literacy on crop insurance among the stakeholders and capacitate farmers to take informed decisions.

    4. Following would be the broad strategies for creating awareness and improve knowledge about the scheme that shall be focused by GoI for desired outcomes:

       1. All IEC and Training and Capacity Building activities need to be carried out in a multi- pronged approach comprising of awareness generation at a mass level and sensitization of key stakeholders at all levels through sensitization programs. The approach will further comprise of engagement of stakeholders actively involved in scheme implementation at the ﬁeld level through continuous trainings and time to time hand holding support. Additionally, greater emphasis shall be on developing long term synergy with apex training institutes for knowledge management in crop insurance ecosystem sector to make it sustainable and scalable for long term education and creation of capacities.

       2. At the beginning of each crop season, concerned Insurance Companies need to prepare a stakeholder-wise micro level IEC and training activity plan and ensure strict implementation of the same. The GoI will facilitate in ﬁnalizing the micro activity plan in consultation with other stakeholders. It will also provide a standard template & SOP detailing target groups, select activities to be undertaken, timeline, frequency, responsibility etc. before the commencement of season.

       3. The Insurance Companies shall undertake an exercise of activity mapping and corresponding budget allocation for IEC and Training. This would help in planning diverse activities with maximum outreach and concentrating on few select activities with enhanced and long-term impact.

All possible means of mass communication such as, print, digital traditional and social media may be utilized to create and disseminate awareness about the provisions and beneﬁts of the Scheme among the farmers and

    the agencies involved in implementing the Scheme.

       5. Awareness generation and training and capacity building activities need to be carried out on regular basis starting from three months prior to the beginning of the enrolment period till the claim settlement for a season. Insurance Companies need to start the work immediately, within 15 days of award of contract and submit a comprehensive plan to the concerned State Governments/UT Administrations and to the GoI.

Any unspent balance of the concerned season shall be carried forward for IEC activities during the next season.

       11. Specific IEC needs of NER/Himalayan States and UTs may be taken up by the GoI through IEC advisory committee on case-to-case basis and the GoI may direct the concerned Insurance Company regarding the same.

All the General Insurance Companies including specialized Insurance Companies as empaneled by DA\&FW, GoI and selected by concerned State Governments/UT Administrations through a tendering process, shall implement PMFBY. Once an Insurance Company has been empaneled by DA\&FW, it is considered as pre- qualiﬁed Company to bid for selection as Implementing Agency (IA) through tenders published by the State/UTs and to undertake implementation of the Scheme/Program in accordance with the advisories, directions and Operational Guidelines issued by DA\&FW, GoI from time to time**.**

       2. Insurance Companies shall not be permitted to surrender full or partial clusters or districts once the company has been selected as L1 bidder. If any Insurance Company declines after being declared L1, it will be de-empaneled/ de-barred to implement crop insurance Scheme for the coming/next season(s) in the concerned or all the State/UTs and L2 may be given the cluster for implementing the crop insurance scheme at L1 district-crop combination rates. If L2 bidder also declines to implement the scheme with prescribed conditions, other bidders’ viz. L3, L4 and so on, shall be asked for their consent. All Such bidders will be required to simultaneously furnish appropriate reasons for withdrawal, surrender or non- acceptance in writing to the State/UT Government with the copy to the DA\&FW, GoI, to enable further corrective measures and appropriate administrative & legal action accordingly. Financial losses, if any, to the State/UT Government, in re-tendering due to withdrawal of selected bidder, will be recovered from the withdrawing L1 bidder.

       3. Each Insurance Company should compulsorily bid for any NER or Himalayan States and UTs. Suitable penalty may be imposed to the non-participating insurers by the D\&FW, GoI.

       4. Core businesses such as underwriting, grievance redressal, claim calculation and settlement cannot be outsourced by the Insurance Company to any third party outside of the organization. Suitable financial penalty shall be imposed on the defaulters by DA\&FW, GoI and will also send recommendations to IRDAI and other regulators for taking necessary action in the matter.

       5. Since premium rate is being decided on the basis of transparent bidding process, the co-insurance arrangements between the insurers as per the standard practices of the insurance industry within the provision of IRDAI regulations and guidelines shall be allowed under PMFBY in order to expand the insurance retention capacity within the country and support smaller insurers to gain experience and increase their capacities. All companies however have to inform such arrangements if any in advance to the DA\&FW, GoI.

    2. ## **Selection Criteria of Empaneled Insurance Companies as Implementing Agency (IA)**

       1. The selection of Insurance Company from the empaneled list, as communicated by DA\&FW, GoI from time to time, to act as Implementing Agency (IA) shall be done by the concerned States/UTs for implementing the Scheme in their State/UT. Selection of IA will be made by adopting the cluster approach by clubbing multiple districts into clusters comprising of 3-6 districts each. In the case of smaller States, the whole State/UT may be assigned to one IA.

       2. Before the commencement of the crop season, **the State/UT Government would invite the pre-qualiﬁed empaneled Insurance Companies through open tender for submission of district-wise and crop-wise cluster level actuarial premium rates as percentage of Sum Insured (ﬁnancial bid)**. Indemnity Level, Threshold Yields, Sum Insured etc. along with all other data and conditions will be the same for all the Insurance Companies for the season. The participating empaneled companies have to bid the premium rates for all the crops notiﬁed / to be notiﬁed in the cluster by the State Governments/UT Administration. Non-compliance will lead to rejection of the bid.

       3. Based on the district-wise and crop-wise actuarial premium rates quoted by the empaneled companies, the total premium amount and weighted average premium rates for cluster of districts will be calculated to arrive at lowest bid rate (L1). The L1 Bidder at cluster level will be selected to act as the Implementing Agency in the concerned cluster.

       4. State/UTs shall be required to select Insurance Companies for minimum period of three years. Ensuring long-term continuity will facilitate the Insurance Companies to build their credibility amongst the farmers by investing in manpower and infrastructure creation and also committing part of its profit towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives through various activities aiming at the welfare and socio-economic development of the farmers viz. creation of the facilities of drinking water, healthcare, education, farm levelling, weather forecasts & advisory services, technology testing and transfer, etc. It is also anticipated that long term continuity gives an opportunity to Insurers, Bankers, State Governments/UT Administrations and other stakeholders to achieve a supportive and collaborative approach to ensure close working relationship and efficiency in service delivery.

       5. The insurance coverage in terms of the number of farmers and acreage should be at least at the level of the corresponding previous season. In case of fall in coverage, DA\&FW, GoI may get the facts examined and the reduction in coverage may impact the ranking of the Insurance Companies and the State/UT Government and also warrant corrective action including penal action by the DA\&FW, GoI.

       6. The State/UT Government may provide the requisite data about past yield of the last 10 consecutive years or more, threshold yield, crop-wise sum insured, indemnity level, insurance unit levels, names of notiﬁed units, calamity years etc. in a digital form by uploading the same on NCIP before ﬂoating the formal tender notice. This will enable in ensuring a single source of data throughout the years and instill confidence and objectivity in the datasets being used for assessment of underlying risk and pricing by the Insurance and re-insurance companies.

32. ## **Clustering/Clubbing of Districts for Bidding by the State/UT**

    1. In order to diversify and spread the risk and cover high risk and low risk districts area without any prejudice, the State Governments/UT Administrations are required to group the districts/ area in such a way that each group contains a mix of districts/ area with different risk proﬁles. Prior to inviting the bid, the Stat/UTs Government, especially the large States have to divide the State into multiple clusters of districts depending on the volume of risk associated in the crops and district/areas proposed to be notiﬁed under the Scheme. The purpose of clustering is to divide the States into different groups of districts, so that expected sum insured (ESI) becomes relatively low and risk is shared and diversiﬁed. The States may form the clusters of districts based on the following approaches:

1. Districts of high risk and low risk areas,

2. Districts of different agro-climatic zones, and

3. ESI of each cluster should be preferably of similar size and order.

   2. The district having a very high risks exposure, i.e., the total Sum Insured (SI) value may also be divided and distributed across clusters, combining sub-districts as a new cluster or clubbing with clusters comprising of other districts. However, while

   dividing the District in more than one clusters, administrative convenience may also be considered. Prior to the bid invitation, details on the cluster formation shall also be made available to the insurance companies compulsorily.

   3. The Clustering/ Clubbing of districts should be done to achieve the following objectives:

1. Cluster formation shall be applicable for up to 3 years and shall not be changed during the contract period. Different clusters may be deﬁned basedon the risk proﬁle of the district so as to increase the diversiﬁcation of risk within a cluster and enable risk spreading for insurer.

2. Cluster may contain districts with mixed agro-climatic zones so as to increase the diversiﬁcation of a risk within a cluster.

3. Crop-wise associated risk may also be diversiﬁed among the clusters and shall be factored in cluster formation.

   4. Hence, one of the major requirements of clustering is the risk analysis of different districts. For the purpose of clustering and clubbing of districts and determination of L1 bidder, the risk is analyzed based on the long-term data of yield by:

1) Computing the average burn cost (percent difference between actual yield and threshold yield) and

2) Computing the level of variability in the long-term yield.

   5. Although high quality long-term yield data is available at IU level since 2016 onwards, but the same is not always reflective of the crop losses especially when the claims on localized risks exceed the yield loss across few states or districts or crops therefore separate assessment of such trends along with the yield variations should be taken into account for underlying risk analysis. Other methods (including the use of satellite data) should also be explored for accurate risk assessment.

   6. Satellite data, of moderate resolution (e.g. Resource-sat, Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS), Terra/Aqua MODIS) are available, for the long-term, i.e. at least around 15 years. The long-term Vegetation Indices, which are indicators of crop health, derived from these satellites can be used to assess the year-to-year variations and thereby understanding the risk potential of an area. It can be combined with many other satellite derived products, such as ﬂood maps, drought assessments and vulnerability and long-term weather data to carry out the risk analysis. State/UTs are advised to take the support of concerned National or State level research organizations (e.g. ISRO- NRSC/SAC, MNCFC, SRSACs, SAUs, etc.), to use the above-mentioned technology for carrying out risk analysis of the Districts/ Talukas/ Blocks towards improvement in clustering. Alternatively, the matter may also be referred to the CPMU established under DA\&FW, GoI for the requisite analysis and feedback.

   7. The above-listed approaches are only to provide guidance to the State/UTs. The State Governments/UT Administrations are free to follow the recommended approaches, or any other method devised by them however, ensuring that the DA\&FW is suitably informed.

   8. The detail illustration for classiﬁcation of risks, clubbing/clustering of risks and districts and determination of L1 bidder are at **Annexure-III.**

    10. ## **Loanee Farmers**

        1. As the Scheme is made optional for all loanee farmers availing KCC loans for notiﬁed crops, it is mandatory for all loanee farmers to submit a signed declaration in the concerned bank branch in case they want to opt-out of the insurance coverage under the Scheme for a particular season anytime during the year but at-least 7 days before the cut-off date for enrolment and premium debiting. In case no such "Opt- out" declaration is submitted by the farmer for the season, they shall be automatically covered by the bank branch for the season. Any change in the crop plan should be brought to the notice of the concerned KCC bank branch immediately but not later than 2 days prior to the cutoff date for the enrolment and premium debiting. This should be supported by a sowing certiﬁcate issued by the concerned village/ sub- district level ofﬁcial of the State/UT.

        2. All loanee farmers are compulsorily required to submit Aadhaar Number or copy of Aadhaar card or authenticate themselves through Aadhaar enabled e-KYC along with mobile number for enrolment under the crop insurance before the prescribed cut-off date.

        3. Insurance Proposals are accepted only up to a stipulated cut-off date for enrollment of farmers and debiting of premium, which will be decided by the SLCCCI of the concerned States/UT. Hence, loanee farmers may verify from the concerned bank branches that applicable premium has been debited and remitted to the Insurance Companies within the cut-off date and details are uploaded on the NCIP as well.

        4. Give information of any loss due to a localized risk or a post-harvest loss due to speciﬁed perils preferably to the Central Grievance Redressal helpline i.e. Krishi Rakshak Portal & Helpline (KRPH) or to the concerned bank branch or enrollment channel partner viz. CSC-VLE or Insurance Intermediaries or Insurance Company within 72 hours.

        5. Loanee farmers should not avail KCC/Agriculture Loan from multiple banks on the same land or insure the same land through more than one bank branch or insure the same land more than once as a non-loanee farmer. If any such cases are reported or identiﬁed, the insurance cover shall be terminated, the premium shall be forfeited, and necessary administrative and legal action may also be taken for such malpractice by the concerned State/UT Government.

    11. ## **Non-Loanee Farmers**

        1. All non-loanee farmers are compulsorily required to submit Aadhaar Number or copy of Aadhaar card or authenticate themselves through Aadhaar enabled e-KYC along with mobile number for enrolment under the crop insurance before the prescribed cut-off date.

        2. Insurance Proposals are accepted only up to a stipulated cut-off date for enrollment of farmers and debiting of premium, which will be decided by the SLCCCI of the concerned States/UT. Therefore, the Non-loanee farmers desirous of availing insurance under the scheme for any notiﬁed crop in any notiﬁed insurance unit may approach the nearest bank-branch or PACS or authorized channel partners or CSC- VLEs or Insurance Intermediaries of Insurance Company or may also directly ﬁll-up the online application on the Mobile App or NCIP within cut-off date. The requisite documents may also be simultaneously submitted along with the applicable premium to concerned agency enrolling the farmers.

        3. Applicants must sign and authorize electronically (using biometric authentication or SMS validation) while enrolling under the scheme along with submitting a copy of the LPC/Land Records or contract document or any other document deﬁned by the concerned State/UT Government to identify share-cropper or tenant farmer, sowing certiﬁcate or self-declaration of intent to sow the proposed crop and copy of bank pass book to the agency enrolling the farmers.

        4. The farmer desiring coverage under crop insurance should open an operative saving bank account in the branch of the designated bank, and the details should be provided while submitting the application for the same. Non-loanee farmers should also link the bank account number with Aadhaar number to enable remittance of claims through AEPS directly into the desired account number.

        5. The farmer should correctly mention their land identiﬁcation number or survey number to enable clear identification of the land parcel during the currency of the insurance cover.

        6. To notify implementing Insurance Company in the event of change of crop or sown area being different from the details previously declared in the application form at- least 2 days before the cut-off date for enrollment of farmers and collection of premium amounts.

        7. The farmer must furnish area sown conﬁrmation certiﬁcate or the self-declaration of intent to sow the proposed notiﬁed crop(s) as per requirement of the notification published by the State/UT.

        8.

    the land belonging to public or Govt. entities. If any such cases are reported or identiﬁed, the insurance cover shall be terminated, the premium shall be forfeited, and necessary administrative and legal action may also be taken for such malpractice by the concerned State/UT Government.

39. ## **National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) for Administration of Crop Insurance Program under PMFBY**

    **39.1.1**  In the implementation of the scheme, multiple stakeholders are involved at different stages from enrolment of farmers till the claim disbursement to farmers. A hallmark of the Scheme is leveraging technology adoption for the effective and auto- administration of the scheme. In an endeavor to integrate technology in the implementation and execution of the Scheme, the DA\&FW, GoI has designed and developed a National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) (https://pmfby.gov.in) which serves as a centralized digital platform for all stakeholders. The idea behind developing a web-based, integrated digital platform is to speed up service delivery, unify fragmented databases, act as a single source of all data and information, eliminate manual processes and thus provide faster insurance services to farmers. This in turn will bring in better administration, transparency and coordination amongst stakeholders viz., Farmers, State/UTs, Insurance Companies, Banks, Common Service Centre-VLEs (CSC-VLEs) & other channel partners and help in administration, monitoring and operationalization of scheme components along with real time dissemination of information. The NCIP captures the entire data relating to insured crops and also serves as the repository for the data relating to the crop insurance scheme.

    2. The NCIP shall provide a single Information Technology (IT) enabled platform for digitization of processes and information data bank and dissemination mechanism, automation of administrative procedures, integration of information and systems across multiple external platforms and data sources, information validation and premium and claim calculation and remittance etc. This IT driven system aims at addressing the issues which affect the current system of program administration, thereby reducing the scheme’s efﬁcacy and leads to denial or delay in beneﬁt transfer to farmers viz. selective or layered information access, manual interventions, multi-step procedures, documentary evidence/proofs, delayed/defective information sharing etc. Hence, integration of IT platforms of banks, Insurance Companies, State/UTs Governments. Yield & weather data providers, Digital Land Records, UIDAI etc., with NCIP directly or through an interface for fetching in information, is felt essential to avoid errors for timely transmission of requisite information amongst major stakeholders, early settlement of claims, proper monitoring and transparent administration of the Schemes. Once the entire linking of IT platforms of all stakeholders with the Web Portal is established, it would also lead to faster processing of claims due to electronic ﬂow of information.

    3. The conceptualization and development of the NCIP has already been completed and launched and facilitates for the notiﬁcation digitization, farmers application enrolment, application management, user management, subsidy release management, claim disbursement etc. Few other functionalities are proposed to be made available in the upcoming version of NCIP wherein following modules have been planned to be incorporated or enhanced and rolled out in coming future.

    4. ## **Different Modules of NCIP**

       1. **Integration with Public Fund Management System**

    The NCIP has been integrated with PFMS and a module known as DigiClaim has been developed for managing ﬁnancial transactions to facilitate release of State/UT and GoI share of premium subsidy, Bank Account and AEPS veriﬁcation and payment of insurance claims by the Insurance Companies to the farmers.

       2. ## **Online Remittance of Premium by Financial Institutions**

    A third-party payment gateway has already been integrated with NCIP for the remittance of farmer premium by the Bank branches and other channels partners like CSC eGov & Insurance Intermediaries. The remitted amount is added in a wallet of the Bank-Branch, CSC-VLE or Insurance Intermediary for onward remittance to the concerned Insurance Company implementing the scheme in a particular geographical area. These partner agencies (Bank Branches, CSC-VLEs & Insurance Intermediaries) can remit the premium amount multiple times to the concerned Insurance Companies before the cut-off-date. For each transaction, a Unique ID (UTR) is assigned using which reconciliation of payments and applications is done by the Insurance Companies.

       3. ## **Add-on Coverage of Crop Risk**

    The State/UT has the option to notify Add-on perils cover with or without Basic Cover (Yield base cover). Selection of risk has been made available on portal as per the provisions available in the guidelines. In the notiﬁcation module, an option has been provided to the States/UTs to select the add-on coverage separately according to the crop and insurance unit along with the Basic Cover as per the notiﬁcation. Claim will be calculated on DigiClaim as per the add-on coverage opted for the crop and IU.

       4. ## **Land Record Integration**

    Land record detail is one of the critical requirements under the PMFBY scheme for validation of insured area. Manual veriﬁcation of the land record data is a sheer challenge. Many State/UTs have digitized land record system, however their hierarchal system and practices are different. DA\&FW has moved ahead to integrate the land record system of 10 major states with NCIP to validate the farmer's land parcel with land record system at the time of enrollment under the scheme.

    State/UTs shares the land record API subsequent to which customization of API consumption for integration of land records of the State(s) with NCIP is executed. The land record details of the farmers is required to be entered during enrolment process and rest of the land details viz. extent of land, ownership share and names of owners/shareholders are fetched through the State/UT land record portal.

    In the Future, as and when the Agri-Stack system becomes operational, the farmer’s Golden ID along with land records, land area, cadastral maps and sown crop details shall be fetched & validated using it.

       5. ## **Location Master Management**

    Location master is the base for the effective implementation of the PMFBY Scheme. The scheme implementation is based on the State's revenue hierarchy. The revenue hierarchy is dynamic, differs from State to State and there might be changes from season to season on account of re-organization of revenue units or creation of new units. NCIP is therefore required to be equipped with related provisions to capture the re-organization of the hierarchy. The location master being used in NCIP is primarily based on Local Government Directory location codes as provided by MoPR.

    Option for addition, amendment and deletion of revenue unit is being considered under the revenue location hierarchy in the NCIP database. The option will work in a maker and checker scenario. Stakeholders like Bank, CSC, Districts, etc. can request the addition of the location unit. State will verify the request and either approve or reject. System will validate the request and display its analysis to the States as a helping tool.

       6. ## **Multi-lingual Portal**

    Existing crop insurance portal supports 11 regional languages including Hindi. However, the data is entered in English only. To support the multilingual data, it is required to convert the data into State speciﬁc local language. Web pages of the NCIP will be enabled in all the supporting languages along with English.

       7. ## **Seasonality Discipline**

    Scheme PMFBY/RWBCIS are driven by seasonality discipline and accordingly the provisions under the portal for different users shall be automated as per the dates notiﬁed.

       8. ## **CCE Agri App for Crop Yield Estimation**

    Mobile applications have been developed and is being used for capturing the CCE data from the ﬁeld and for uploading on the server. CCE Agri app works in both online and ofﬂine mode. CCE Agri app captures, Form-1, Form-2 & Form-3 data along with geo-coordinated photographs. It is customizable as per the requirement of the States. Further, following functionalities have also been enabled:

          1) ### **CCE schedule digitization**

    State/UTs schedules the CCE for the insurance unit and crop. State selects the village (If IU is at higher level) and plot (Survey/Sub Survey no.) randomly for conducting the CCE. There are two ways to select the CCE plot i.e. through smart sampling technique or conventional method. In State/UT's login, option to declare the randomly selected village of the IU and survey number /sub survey number of CCE ﬁeld for a crop shall be developed. State shall declare the locations for the selection of CCE ﬁeld according to smart sampling technique or the conventional technique. In smart sampling technique, the geo-coordinates and survey/sub survey number for the CCE ﬁeld are shared currently by MNCFC through conventional method which going forward shall be shared through the APIs. Under the conventional method, the survey number shall be selected though the random sampling mechanism. Further, the schedule of the CCE shall be approved by the

    State/UTs. The approved schedule shall then be available to the concerned insurance company for co-observing the CCEs.

          2) ### **Smart Sampling Technique**

    GoI through MNCFC or CPMU shall share the Geo-coordinates of the CCE ﬁeld through API and the same will be shared to the CCE-Agri App based on the declaration done by the State for the use of smart sampling technique. CCE Agri App will validate the CCE primary worker's geo-coordinate with the co-ordinates shared for smart sampling technique and ensure the authenticity of location and CCE Plot.

          3) ### **State Speciﬁc customization**

    CCE speciﬁcations may differ from State to State i.e. measurement units of CCE ﬁeld, shape of CCE plot etc. State speciﬁc customization has already been made for the smooth implementation of CCE through CCE Agri App across all States/UTs.

       9. ## **Digitization and Customized Notification**

    Notiﬁcation is the basis for the enrolment of application of farmers under NCIP. Under notiﬁcation, the State declares the crop, premium rate, scale of ﬁnance and other parameters. Accordingly, premium amount is calculated on the basis of the premium rate and scale of ﬁnance deﬁned under notiﬁcation. Revised guidelines allow State/UTs to exempt the farmer's premium but, in such cases, differential premium is borne by the State Govt./UT. However, in this scenario at least Re.1 per application is taken from farmer as token money to have the record of such applications on the Portal and also to facilitate electronic tracking, enrolment validations & reconciliation. Also, if the State/UT provides the exemption for the farmer's premium for certain limit of land area, the same also have been provided on the NCIP. Two additional variants of customizable notification are as follows:

          1) ### **Absolute amount-based farmer premium**

    In case of enabling option in notiﬁcation to declare the farmer premium in absolute amount the State needs to enter the premium amount instead of percentage. However, the total amount of farmer premium shall not exceed the amount calculated in terms of percentage deﬁned in the Operational Guidelines. Also, the State/UT may deﬁne that this exemption shall be facilitated on the ﬁrst cum ﬁrst serve basis up to certain limit. For example, for the ﬁrst 1,000 applications the farmer premium may be Rs.1 or Rs. 100 only.

          2) ### **Limited area-based notiﬁcation**

    State limits the farmer premium subsidy upto certain limit of the insured area for a farmer. If the insured area exceeds the deﬁned limit, then farmer has to pay the full premium for the exceeded area insured. The notiﬁcation module has already been developed to cater to such requirements and customization.

       10. ## **Subsidy Release Framework**

    Premium Subsidy is an important feature of the scheme. GoI and State/UT Government share the insurance premium subsidy with implementing Insurance

    Companies on behalf of insured farmers. The subsidy release framework is being implemented through NCIP to keep track of the movement of subsidy from the State/UTs and the GoI to the Insurance Companies.

    The NCIP shall auto-calculate the State and Central Subsidy as per the applicable provisions of Operational Guidelines, State Notification and on the basis of applications approved on NCIP. Accordingly, Insurance companies raise the subsidy release request with the State Government/UT Administration through NCIP.

    All the subsidy release sanction order are entered by the State/UT and the GoI on NCIP for the purpose of reconciliation, payment and audit purposes.

       11. ## **Crop Insurance App for Self Service**

    Crop Insurance App is mobile based app developed for the farmers for self-service related to all requirements under PMFBY. Through this app, farmers can enroll themselves directly and can track the status of their application and the status of the claims. The app has also been enabled for Crop Loss Intimation.

       12. ## **Monitoring Framework/MIS Dashboard**

    Module wise web reports for monitoring the progress of schemes on different parameters for different stakeholders has already been made available on NCIP which can be accessed using separate logion credentials. These reports are granular, having information till the lower level. Comparative reports with earlier respective seasons on different parameters for the users have been developed and are available for all stakeholders.

    Search module has also been available in each stakeholder's login on different parameters like Policy search, Farmer search, Notiﬁcation search, Bank-Branch Search, Location master Search, User Search etc.

       13. ## **DigiClaim: Automatic Claim Calculation and Settlement**

    DigiClaim module has been developed on NCIP with functionality for claim calculation, claim approval/rejection and settlement using PFMS platform. Modules have also been developed for the States/UTs to upload and approve the IU and crop wise and season-wise AY and TY values. States/UTs are also required to upload the loss cost under Preventive Sowing/Failed Germination and Mid-Season Adversity claims. Insurance Companies are required to accept the AY & TY values uploaded and approved by States/UTs and also accept the loss cost under Preventive Sowing/Failed Germination and Mid-Season Adversity claims. Once the values are finally accepted, the corresponding claims are calculated automatically for further processing of claims settlement though PFMS platform directly into farmer’s account.

    States/UTs are also required to approve the Loss Cost for claims under RWBCIS which is uploaded by the concerned Insurance Company on NCIP before the calculation of corresponding claims. Once the claims are calculated, the same are processed through PFMS platform for direct remittance into farmers bank account.

    Provisions for following Claims Type have also been developed:

           1) Prevented Sowing

           2) Mid-Season Adversity

           3) Localized Risks

           4) Post-Harvest Losses

           5) Yield based Widespread Calamities

           6) Add-on Cover Claim settlement under PMFBY

           7) Weather Based Claims for RWBCIS

           8) Add-on Cover Claim settlement under RWBCIS

       14. ## **Centralized Call Centre—KRPH (14447)**

    A National level integrated grievance redressal mechanism having digital portal and a call centre named as Krishi Rakshak Portal & Helpline (KRPH) has been developed to enable farmers to lodge their grievances/concerns/queries. The KRPH has a short code **Toll-Free number 14447** for farmers to call and raise their concerns, queries and grievances.

    KRPH has also been dovetailed with National Crop Insurance Portal and integrated with all stakeholders viz. Insurance Companies, Banks, CSC-VLEs, District Administration and State Govt. departments for real-time tracking, monitoring and redressal of grievances and queries of the farmers covered under PMFBY.

       15. ## **WINDS – Hyperlocal Weather Data Platform**

    WINDS (Weather Information Network & Data System) is a pioneering initiative of the country to set-up a network of Automatic Weather Stations & Rain Gauges at Taluk/Block and Gram Panchayat level to create a strong database of hyper-local weather data for the different Govt. and other entities to use for all farmer and farming oriented services. The hyper-local weather data so collected will be used for claim assessment under Parametric Crop insurance, Yield estimation through Technology, Crop-Region specific Agriculture Advisories to the Farmers, Disaster Risk Resilience & Mitigation needs. As of now the country has approx. 13,000 AWS and 20,000 ARGs installed for all institutions including IMD. Under WINDS, an additional 3,500 AWS and Approx. 1.6 lakh ARGs are proposed to be established across the country. IMD and DA\&FW have collaborated for setting up this network to make it 5 times of what it is today.

    The data collected from AWS should be available in the WINDS portal designed and developed by DA\&FW, GoI. This will also act as the single data pipeline for data related to Rainfall/Weather stations across the country. This data will be a Digital Public Good. The WINDS portal shall be maintained & hosted by DA\&FW, GoI.

    The Ministry of Earth Sciences/IMD will be responsible for the supervision, regulation and ensuring quality standards as per WINDS framework to ensure accuracy of the data. In order to foster & leverage the value of information and data for welfare and betterment of farmers and citizens, the data shall be available to users and concerned stakeholders through standard APIs.

       16. ## **AIDE App for Enrollment through Intermediaries**

    In addition to the existing channels of enrolment for non-loanee farmers viz. CSC, Banks, Post Offices etc., a smart-phone App also has been designed and rolled out in Kharif 2023 for enrolment of farmers at their doorsteps through a large network of Insurance Intermediaries. This App has been designed to streamline the process of enrolment and offer a completely paper-less and cash-less experience to a farmer to get enrolled by leveraging the digital technology for registration, documentation and premium payment.

    As of now the option is enabled for the insurance company for which the cluster is allocated i.e. L1 insurance company as per bidding process. As per the guidelines, other empaneled Insurance Companies which have participated in the bidding and are keen for enrolment of non-loanee farmers in the cluster may also be allowed to enroll non-loanee farmers at L1 premium rate. The interested companies have to inform their willingness in writing within seven days of ﬁnalization of tender/issuance of work order to L1. The AIDE App shall be enabled for such interested Insurance Companies to also do the enrollment of farmers under PMFBY.

       17. ## **SARTHI for Risk Resilience though Insurance**

    To facilitate a comprehensive risk protection environment for Agriculture and Rural sector, GoI has developed an open-source digital platform called Sandbox for Agricultural & Rural Security, Technology & Insurance Platform , which will provide seamless integration of different insurance products approved by IRDAI & offered by Insurance Companies and allow for digital distribution of the products via various distribution channels directly to the farmers through a farmer facing application. This digital platform (Mobile App & Web Platform) will help offer the bouquet of products curated by the insurance companies for the agriculture & rural communities and will offer customized insurance products tailored as per the specific needs and the risks faced by the farming & rural households in different regions across complete agriculture value chain.

       18. ## **Integration of NCIP with Crop Insurance portal of State/UTs**

    Some States e.g., Karnataka have their own crop insurance portals and farmers data is captured on their State portal. Integration of State's portal with the NCIP is required for the ﬂow of information for centralized monitoring.

    In this case, the State shares the API for transferring the data from State's Portal to NCIP. The APIs get tested with the input parameter for the desired output. All the attributes related to farmer, farmer enrolment, threshold yield, actual yield, claims etc. are to be shared. Any update in the records must be brought into sync with the NCIP.

       19. ## **Integration of NCIP with the External Agencies using Block Chain technology**

    Insurance Companies and Banks are one of the important stakeholders for the implementation of the scheme and provide crop insurance to the farmers. Farmers' applications, entered into the NCIP by the banks and other channel partners, are validated by the Insurance Companies and approval, reversion or rejection of applications happen. The Banks and Insurance Companies have their own system for application creation and processing respectively. Integration of NCIP with the

    internal tech system of the Insurance Companies and Banks will be done for the ﬂow of information to-and-fro in an automated manner over block chain network. Block chain nodes shall be created at NCIP and at the Insurance Company’s and Bank’s end. Farmer Applications and other relevant details will be replicated to the respective Insurance Company and Bank database. NCIP and external partner’s nodes shall always be in sync. Changes in NCIP node will automatically update the information on other partner’s node over block chain network. NCIP node will be the primary source of data.

       20. ## **SMS and Instant messaging platform**

    SMS platform has already been enhanced for sending the intimation or acknowledgement to the stakeholders. SMS is sent for every change in the status of the application for the farmer and also at the time of initiation of eligible claims to the farmer’s account. Additionally, instant messaging platforms have also been developed for real-time interactive communication involving AI enabled chat-bot system.

       21. ## **Change of Crop/s**

    Farmers, having crop loan from ﬁnancial institutions, covered under the Scheme, can change the insured crop up to 2 working days before the cut- off-date. Farmer can raise the crop change request for the current season as per the applicable guideline for which interface shall be developed on the NCIP, Crop Insurance App, and Krishi Rakshak Portal & Helpline (KRPH) for enabling the same. Intimation of the crop change request and its status tracker shall also be shared with the farmer via SMS. Crop change request shall also be displayed to the concerned stakeholder for necessary action.

    Due to the change in insured crop, sum insured, and premium will change accordingly. Changes in application details due to change in crop will be carried out on NCIP & Crop Insurance App under which a crop change facility shall be provided. Option to handle excess and short farmer premium shall also be provided which shall enable correction in premium amount as per changed crop specifications.

       22. ## **Aadhaar Vault implementation**

    Aadhaar Number and Aadhaar related information to be encrypted by a reference key and stored in Aadhaar Vault; all protocols to be deﬁned as per UIDAI guidelines shall be implemented for the purpose.

       23. ## **YES-TECH- Platform for Technology Based Yield Estimation**

    YES-TECH (Yield Estimation based on Technology) is a technology-based yield estimations mechanism which has been developed after 2 years of rigorous testing and pilot runs across 100 districts of the country. Crop Loss assessment and Yield estimation approaches assisted by data inputs from sources such as Remote Sensing indices, Weather indices WINDS and/or IMD, crop phenological information, soil types etc. using approved models have been finalized for adoption.

    YES-TECH provides for minimum 30% threshold for technology driven yield for arriving at the final crop yield value for the crops identified and approved for YES- TECH. These values of technology driven crop yield along with multiple modeling and data synthesis are required to be digitized and made available on a digital platform to enable utilization of same by different stakeholders. A digital platform therefore is envisaged to be developed for all practical purposes under YES-TECH.

    Yield Calculated under YES-TECH will be reviewed on a six-monthly basis by a High-Power Committee. The learnings and feedback shall be used for improving the existing models, including those being used at the National level by MNCFC. The raw data shall also be used by MNCFC and DES for triangulation of yield estimates and for further Research & Development. Yield Data is of the nature of public good therefore there will be a Central repository of yield data so that it is accessible to the insurers, researchers and others interested stakeholders.

       24. ## **Auto-Calculation of Service Charges**

    The bank Head Ofﬁces, CSC e-Gov & Insurance Intermediaries shall request service charges from Insurance Companies based on approved applications for the respective season. The Bank HQ, CSC e-Gov & Insurance Intermediaries shall compulsorily enter the GST details and details of the bank accounts for remittance of service charge on NCIP to facilitate online generation and routing of the bank service charge invoice for the use of concerned Insurance Company and remittance of the same electronically while creating transaction logs on NCIP for tracking and reconciliation.

    In cases where the farmer's premium is borne by the Government, the service charges shall be calculated on the actual farmer’s premium as is pre-defined in these guidelines irrespective of the amount deducted/paid.

    The NCIP shall calculate the applicable service charges for Bank, CSC and Insurance Intermediaries based on the approved applications. It shall be calculated at the end of the season to minimize the variation. Auto calculated service charges along with demand/invoice from the concerned partner shall be available in insurance company login for approval. The validated service charges shall be paid electronically to the concerned agencies by the Insurance Companies as per the timelines envisaged under the Operational Guidelines.

       25. ## **NCIP as a Single Source of Truth for Risk Analysis**

    NCIP shall be developed to be a single source of truth for all data and statistics related to PMFBY ranging from Historical crop yield data, weather data, remote sensing indices, coverage and claim details etc. NCIP shall transition from being a data repository to an auto-administrating mechanism for implementation of scheme as per the provisions and applicable guidelines.

    Further, the NCIP shall also have module to analyze the underlying risk and auto- calculate the loss cost/burn cost to assist the States/UTs to compare and evaluate the cost of premium quoted by the Insurance Companies through the bidding process. Apart from this, the NCIP shall also assist GoI in defining its liabilities towards premium subsidy across states especially for the states/UTs who are

    implementing Cup & Cap Models.

       26. ## **Crop Monitoring through Digital Crop Survey (DCS) and CROPIC: Deep Technology for Crop Loss Assessment**

    CROPIC shall be mandatory for implementing Insurance Companies & State Government/UTs to use though their field resources for collection & monitoring of crop health & stress/calamity. Further the App may be used by farmers to crowdsource the photographs during the crop life cycle & during calamity affecting the crops. Further, the pictures collected through CROPIC Mobile App shall remain within the NCIP server and may be consumed though APIs for validation, analytics & research by other DPIs of the Govt. and external entities duly approved/empaneled by GoI as & when required.

    The photograph received from Digital Crop Survey shall be used for validation of sown and insured crops whereas the photographs received from CROPIC Mobile App shall be used for crop health monitoring over entire crop life cycle, crop damage assessment at the time of any localized and wide-spread calamity or climatic condition affecting the crops for making the quick claim payment and also act as an input for Technology based yield estimation models.

    While using the CROPIC Mobile App, details of location (village), name of sown Crop and polygon with latitude-longitude of subject Land Parcel shall be mandatorily captured. For the intended purpose it is not mandatory to identify the land-parcel ID, cadastral map of land parcel & details of cultivating farmer for randomized mechanism of Crop Health Monitoring. However, for the purpose of Crop Damage Assessment on specific land parcel, land parcel ID & Insured Farmers details shall be captured though App and validated against the insurance data as available on NCIP and also against the data provided through Agri-Stack wherever applicable.

    Further, under another initiative of GoI, named as Digital Crop Survey (DCS), one time photograph of crop at each land parcel of the country at any stage during entire crop life cycle is envisaged to be collected. The data from this one-time crop picture at each land parcel taken under DCS may also be used for verification of crop being cultivated on the particular land parcel with the insured crop for pre and/or post insurance validation & QC purpose. For this the corresponding data collected shall be consumed through APIs however the pictures collected under DCS shall remain within the DCS/designated server and may be fetched through APIs for validation for insurance as and when required.

    The Pictures and data collected through CROPIC shall all be fed into a specially developed digital system and will be used for crop identification, crop health monitoring at different stages, further analytics, exceptions identification and triangulated informatics & decision support system including verification of perils like mid-season adversity, pertaining to Insurance & other agricultural objectives.

       27. ## **Integration with Agri-Stack & Krishi DSS**

    Govt. of India is developing a Digital Public Infrastructure in the country which captures and maintains farmer registry, crop sown registry, and geo-referenced village maps. Agri-Stack shall enable interconnecting various digital databases spread across various States/UTs and other public & private entities across the

    country and globally also for leveraging various digital capabilities to increase the efficiency and service delivery across various farmer welfare schemes being run by the Central Govt. & State Governments/UT Administrations. One such DPI is Agri- Stack wherein a Digital centralized switch will act as a conduit between multiple users and databases across the country & beyond. The information and data being collected through various sources and modes then shall be converged together for an informed and fortified decision support system known as Krishi DSS platform.

    For effective and efficient management of PMFBY, the DA\&FW will rely on the data sharing mechanism of AgriStack. The relevant data pertinent to implementation of scheme shall be consumed electronically (using open API) for the purposes of beneficiary identification, verification, benefit delivery and monitoring pertaining to the States. Districts and villages where these data are available. The information as and when collected and collated in the Farmers registry, digital crop surveys, and geo-referenced village maps shall be used for implementation of this scheme. The NCIP shall therefore be integrated with Agri-Stack & Krishi DSS to leverage huge capacities of both the systems to bring in more efficient and objective implementation of PMFBY and other insurance programs under SARTHI.

       28. ## **Validation of Farmers, Land and Crops with KCC Ecosystem**

    A large proportion of insured farmers under PMFBY comes from loanee farmers having Short Term Agriculture Operational Loans i.e. Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) through institutional financing channels i.e. SCB, RRB & Coop Banks.

    It is therefore important to identify and validate the farmers, their land details and crops sown with the details entered for insurance purposes to rule out any mis- utilization or misreporting under the scheme. This will also assist in identification of farmers who have not been enrolled under PMFBY despite they not opting out of the scheme and therefore help in fixing responsibilities on the erring banks and branches for knowingly depriving the farmers from the benefits of the scheme.

       29. ## **Integration with Various Digital Platforms**

    To streamline the ﬂow of information amongst stakeholders, the portal will also be integrated with the system/data being developed by multiple other platforms and digital public infrastructure:

           1) Settlement of Yield data disputes or disputes relating to crop loss.

           2) ACF (Area Correction Factor) for insured crop for every season.

           3) Satellite data-based Clustering.

           4) Integration of smart sampling tool for CCE plot selection.

           5) Integration of innovative technology driven approach for rationalization of CCE.

           6) Integration with the technique that is being developed for estimation of crop yield at Gram Panchayat level.

           7) Cadastral level crop and land ownership veriﬁcation.

           8) Smart Sampling technique.

           9) Agristack and Agri DSS being developed by GoI for the purpose of various data validation and standardization protocols.

**ANNEXURE – I**

**Add-on Coverage for Crop Loss due to Attack by Wild Animals**

1. **Coverage for Crop Loss due to Attack by Wild Animals:**

   1. The provision for cover against losses to crops due to attack of wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be substantial (equivalent to or more than the indemnity level under PMFBY), is identiﬁable and is not frequent or regular shall be covered. It is intended for farmers whose crop ﬁelds are likely to be affected by raiding or grazing or by the impact of damage by movement of wild animals occasionally affecting the individual isolated farms. This cover is intended to provide protection against such incidences causing irreversible damage to the standing and insured crop.

   2. The deﬁnition of wild animals will be as per the categorization of the MoEF\&CC and/or Forest Department of respective State Govt./UT based on historic analysis of yield losses of crops occurred. Hence, the nodal department of the State Governments/UT Administrations implementing the scheme should obtain the consent and validation from MoEF\&CC and/or State Govt. /UT forest department for list of area/IU wise prevalent Wild animals.

2. ### **Risks Covered:**

   1. Initially this add-on cover would be available on a pilot basis. In the initial stages of pilot, the add-on cover against losses due to wild animals would be available for those crops only which have a history of demonstrable economic loss by attack of wild animals and the cover shall be available up to the limit of indemnity level notified by the State/UT. List of these wild animals will be notiﬁed by State Governments/UT Administrations, preferably notiﬁed area/IU wise.

   2. Notiﬁcation of the wild animals covered under add-on cover shall be done in area(s) and crop(s) to be notiﬁed under the scheme.

3. ### **Risk Acceptance:**

   1. As substantial historic yield data is not available to establish the economic losses to crops by attack of wild animals, actuarial pricing is not possible at present for this add-on cover. However, states having 10-12 years historic yield loss data attributed to crops by wild animals can ask for a separate premium rate for this add-on cover along with the PMFBY tender, although the add-on actuarial premium rate will be considered separately and shall not form a part of the evaluation of L1 bidder for PMFBY. Further, same Insurance company shall implement PMFBY and add-on cover of loss due to attack by wild animals in a given district or cluster. L1 bidder of PMFBY will be asked to match the L1 rate of add-on coverage. In case L1 PMFBY bidder doesn't agree to match the L1 add-on coverage rates, State may negotiate with L1 PMFBY bidder for coverage of add-on cover due to wild animals.

   2. States may ensure that the actuarial premium rate quoted by the Insurance Companies should be rational basis the past loss experience. Under this provision all risks will be borne by the concerned Insurance Companies.

   3. Alternatively, those states not having requisite historical yield loss data to crops damaged by the attack of wild animals to determine the rational actuarial premium rate, can consider implementing this add-on cover on corpus model. However, there should be some past experience of demonstrable crop losses by wild animals. The State Govt./UT shall ask for a separate administrative service fee for implementation of add-on cover along with the PMFBY tender, however, the administrative service

   fee shall be considered separately and shall not form a part of the evaluation of L1 bidder for PMFBY. Further, same Insurance company will implement PMFBY and add-on cover of loss due to attack by wild animals in a given district or cluster. L1 bidder of PMFBY will be asked to match the L1 administrative service fee. In case L1 PMFBY bidder doesn't agree to match the administrative service fee, State/UT may negotiate with L1 PMFBY bidder for providing operational support for implementation of add-on cover due to wild animals.

   4. The total liability towards crop loss due to Add-on cover of wild animal attack shall be met first from PMFBY and only differential claims shall be met from the add-on cover. In case any farmer has 100% crop loss due to attack of wild animals then the farmer will not be eligible for any claims under PMFBY. The total liability under the add-on cover shall be limited to the value of indemnity level multiplied with the total sum insured. Farmer shall be eligible for claims as per the provisions applicable for Localized Calamity as defined under **Para 21.5** of these guidelines.

   5. State Governments/UT Administrations opting for corpus model for the implementation of this add-on cover will create a corpus fund at the State level to provide claims to eligible farmers over and above the claims exceeding the eligible claims under normal PMFBY. Any claims arising for this add-on cover will be paid from the corpus fund with 100% contribution from concerned State Governments/UT Administrations through the State/UT Forest Department or Nodal Department implementing PMFBY, provided the concerned departments have the available provisions /allocation for the same. Detailed modalities of Corpus fund and its management shall be framed by the concerned State Governments/UT Administrations in consultation with their concerned department/MoEF\&CC well before ﬂoating the tender for greater transparency and better understanding of the add-cover amongst the other stakeholders.

   6. Under corpus mode, the Insurance Companies under PMFBY for the respective season will also act as an implementing agency for this add-on cover at deﬁned rational administrative charges notiﬁed by the State Governments/UT Administrations at the time of the tender in consultation with the Insurance Companies. The notional premium of the farmers should at least be equivalent to the administrative service fee being charged by the implementing Insurance Companies.

   7. This add-on cover would run concurrently and follow the cut-off dates as speciﬁed in seasonality discipline of PMFBY and shall be available for only those farmers who are enrolled under PMFBY. Farmers who opt for this cover shall be enrolled after payment of a notional premium notiﬁed by the state governments/UT Administrations at the time of the notiﬁcation for both alternatives mentioned above. The States/UTs may also subsidize the farmers’ share of premium for add-on cover fully or partially as per their discretion however, there would not be any subsidy liability on the Central Govt. for the same.

### **Claim Payment Illustration:**

**Case \- I:**

Sum Insured \= Rs.1,00,000

Yield Based Claims \= Rs. 60,000

Crop loss due to Add-on Coverage (Wild Animals) \= Rs.40,000

Indemnity Level \= 80%

Claims due to Add-on Coverage (Wild Animals) \= Rs.40,000 X 80% \= 32,000

Total admissible claims to the Farmers \= Rs. 60,000

Liability of claims met through PMFBY (Insurance Company) \= Rs. 60,000

Liability on Add-on Cover (Insurance Company or Corpus Fund) \= Nil

### **Case \- II:**

Sum Insured \= Rs.1,00,000

Yield Based Claims \= Rs. 40,000

Crop loss due to Add-on Coverage (Wild Animals) \= Rs.70,000

Indemnity Level \= 80%

Claims due to Add-on Coverage (Wild Animals) \= Rs.56,000 Total admissible claims to the Farmers \= Rs. 56 ,000  
Liability of claims met through PMFBY (Insurance Company) \= Rs. 40,000 Liability on Add-on Cover (Insurance Company or Corpus Fund) \= Rs. 16,000

Note: If the loss due to add-on cover happens mid-season, claim for the same should be paid to the farmer first by the Insurance Company or through the corpus as the case may be. In case the add-on cover is implemented through corpus fund, the Insurance Company implementing PMFBY shall be replenished by the corpus fund for the additional claim liability under Add-on cover after payment of eligible claims under normal PMFBY.

8. As mentioned in **Para 5.2.5** of these OGs of PMFBY, the ﬁnancial liability towards claims under corpus mode of this add-on cover shall be borne by the concerned State Governments/UT Administrations only. However, the fund available in other related schemes of the State Governments/UTs and assistance aid of MoEF\&CC may also be utilized for meeting the ﬁnancial liabilities of States/UTs.

   9. State Governments/UT Administrations may provide requisite information related to historic crop losses by wild animals etc. to the Insurance Companies and also get concurrence in the SLCCCI meeting for implementation of add-on cover and mode to be adopted.

   10. ### **Eligibility Criteria:**

       1. This add-on cover will only be available if this cover is notiﬁed by the State Governments/UT Administrations.

       2. Available to all those insured farmers, at land parcel level, affected by above mentioned perils in a Notiﬁed IU growing notiﬁed crops for which insurance under normal PMFBY has been availed.

       3. Only those farmers would be eligible for ﬁnancial support under this cover who have paid the premium for the add-on cover. i.e. the premium has been debited from their account before the occurrence of the insured peril.

       4. Available for all notiﬁed crops which has been declared eligible for the Add-on cover as per the notiﬁcation issued by the States/UTs and damaged by Wild Animal attack during when the crop is in standing condition up till harvesting.

       5. Maximum liability is limited to the Sum Insured value arrived by multiplying indemnity level with the total Sum Insured of the damaged crop's area and the pay-out under this provision would be in proportion to the loss incurred on crop due to the occurrence of the insured peril. The sum insured will be same as notiﬁed under PMFBY. **There would not be any additional sum insured for this add-on cover.**

       6. The add-on cover will be optional for both the loanee and non-loanee farmers. If a farmer opts for the cover, he will have to pay notional premium rate. However, the concerned State Governments/UT Administrations will provide remaining premium

   as subsidy and/or eligible claims from the corpus fund as per the mode adopted.

       7. Non-loanee farmers will opt for this add-on cover at the time of enrolment and loanee farmers will inform the concerned Bank branches to opt for this cover in writing at least 2 working days prior to the prescribed cut-off date of enrolment and debiting of premium. Provision in this regard shall be made in NCIP for capturing the enrollment of farmers under the add-on cover, however, State Governments/UT Administrations and concerned Insurance Companies shall maintain the granular data of insured farmers under add-on cover.

       8. This add-on cover will be available initially for major crops only.

       9. The State Governments/UT Administrations would notify the list of wild animals, which inhabit the region & IU and crop-wise which will be covered under this add-on cover in consultation with state forest department.

       10. The add-on cover would be applicable from 30 days after sowing to harvesting period. The coverage duration should compulsorily be notiﬁed by the State/UT in the notiﬁcation also.

       11. Indemnity would be payable only when the area affected by notiﬁed wild animals is more than 25% of the individual insured land parcel, and the affected notiﬁed crop has less than 25% chances of crop revival till harvest. This provision may be reviewed by the respective implementing States & UTs as per their specific requirements.

       12. If the pay-out under area-approach (based on CCEs data) is more than losses under this add-on cover, the balance claims, if any, shall be settled at the end of season.

4. ### **Proxy-Indicators:**

   **4.1.1**  Incidence of raiding or grazing by wild animal must be substantiated by media reports or the reports of the agriculture and/or Forest and/or Revenue department. The State governments/UT Administrations may also consider other reports of damage including reports of Panchayati Raj or Gram Sabha etc. as intimation and quantity of loss. However, only damage assessment report based on the joint survey report as per provisions under clause of the Operational Guidelines applicable for Localized Claims shall be considered for deciding the extent of crop damage and eligible claims.

5. ### **Loss Assessment Procedure:**

   1. **Time and method of reporting the loss/claims:**

1. The State Governments/UT Administrations would notify crop-wise and the agro- climatic zone. This provision can be invoked during the period while the crop is in standing position (30 days after crop sowing to harvesting period). In the case of any event occurring beyond this period, this provision shall not be applicable under any circumstances.

2. Immediate intimation (within 72 hours) by the insured farmer as detailed in **Para**

   2. (Annexure I) below.

3. Intimation must contain details of insured farmer's name, affected survey number- wise insured crop and acreage affected, Farmer's Application No. as on NCIP, his/her Mobile Number etc. KCC A/c No. (in case of loanee farmer)or Saving bank Account (in case of non-Loanee farmer as declared at the time of applying for crop insurance) for identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation purpose.

4. Premium payment veriﬁcation to be done from the NCIP and in case of need,may be veriﬁed from the bank. The bank shall provide the payment veriﬁcation within the next 48 hours of receipt of such request.

5. Mobile application may be used for reporting incidence of localized calamities for intimation of events including longitude/latitude details and pictures using Mobile App developed by DA\&FW.

   2. Localized Calamity claim amount at individual farm level shall be calculated as per the following formula:

   𝑆𝒖𝒎 𝑰𝒏𝒔𝒖𝒓𝒆𝒅 × 𝑨𝒇𝒇𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝑨𝒓𝒆𝒂 𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝒐𝒇(%) × 𝑬𝒔𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝑪𝒓𝒐𝒑 𝑫𝒂𝒎𝒂𝒈𝒆 (%) 𝒙 𝑰𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒎𝒏𝒊𝒕𝒚 𝑳𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒍

𝒕𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝑰𝒏𝒔𝒖𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝑨𝒓𝒆𝒂	𝒊𝒏 𝑨𝒇𝒇𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝑨𝒓𝒆𝒂

3. For estimation of crop loss in the individual farms/land parcels, the digital Crop Loss Assessment App developed by the GoI shall be compulsorily used by the Insurance Companies, States/UTs and loss surveyors appointed by the concerned Insurance Companies.

6. ### **Channel of Reporting i.e. Whom to be Reported:**

   1. Intimation may be given within 72 hours by the farmer either directly through the **"Crop Insurance App"** or centralized toll-free number of **Krishi Rakshak Portal & Helpline (14447)**. The intimation may also be forwarded through the concerned bank branch, local agriculture department Government/district ofﬁcials or through the toll-free number. The ﬁrst mode of intimation should be the "Crop Insurance App" and the centralized Toll-Free Number for this purpose. This can be followed by intimation through the bank or district ofﬁcials to Insurance Company for conducting individual level investigations. The concerned bank/intermediary, if asked by the Insurance Companies, would verify the insured details like crop insured, sum insured, premium debited and date of debit & remittance and share with the Insurance Company for conducting the crop loss assessment.

   2. Reporting of losses will be done through the Crop Insurance App and the Centralized Toll-Free Number (KRPH), along with other channels. Other Channels will be phased out subsequently.

   3. In case the intimation has been given through the concerned bank branch or State/UT Government ofﬁcials, the same shall be forwarded by the Bank Branches or Govt. officials of the concerned Insurance Company within the next 48 hours through available channels or Krishi Rakshak Portal & Helpline.

7. ### **Documentary Evidence Required for Claim Assessment:**

   1. Duly ﬁlled crop loss intimation through the Crop Insurance App or Krishi Rakshak Portal & Helpline, or other mentioned channels, along with all relevant documents is necessary for initiation of loss assessment and payment of claims. However, if information on all the columns is not readily available, partial information may be sent to the Insurance Company and later within 7 days of the loss, the complete details may be submitted.

   2. The Insurance Companies are responsible for ensuring that sufﬁcient number of loss intimation forms are available at the bank branch, local Government ofﬁcials level. Any other additional documents can be collected directly from the farmer at the time of loss assessment by the representative/surveyor of the Insurance Company. Insurance Company shall complete all formalities and collect any ancillary information required for the payment of such claims, like local newspaper cutting and any other available evidence to substantiate the occurrence of loss event and

   severity of the loss, if any.

8. ### **Appointment of Loss Assessors by the Insurance Company:**

   1. The loss assessors would be appointed by the Insurance Company for assessment of losses due to incidence of Localized Calamities. The loss assessors appointed by the Insurance Companies should be in accordance with the IRDAI provisions. The loss assessors appointed should possess following experience and qualiﬁcation:

* Diploma/degree in any subject with minimum 2 years relevant experience or

bachelor’s degree in agriculture and allied subjects with one year experience.

* Retired Government ofﬁcials of Agriculture/ Horticulture/ Extension Department having Diploma/B.Sc(Ag.) degree.

* Retired Bank ofﬁcials with experience of agriculture value chain financing or Kisan Credit Card (KCC).

  2. For compliance under the above provisions the Insurance Companies would utilize the empaneled loss assessors for using their services as and when required.

  3. The loss would be jointly assessed by a team comprising of loss assessors appointed by the insurer, block level agriculture ofﬁcer, primary worker of the agriculture or revenue department and the concerned farmer. Loss assessment surveys shall be conducted by the Joint Committee, at each individual ﬁeld level, through the Mobile App specifically developed for the same by the GoI. The loss assessment data shall be uploaded on the NCIP on a real time basis to arrive at the Claim amount of the eligible insured farmers.

9. ### **Time Frame for Loss Assessment and Claims Payment:**

2. Loss assessment to be done only after lapse of minimum 7 days (for assessing the chances of revival) and must be completed within next 14 days of the receipt of information of loss.

3. Claim settlement/payment to the farmers to be completed in next 1 days (subjectto receipt of premium).

4. Maximum liability is limited to the maximum or balance Sum Insured of the damaged crop’s area and the pay-out under this provision would be in proportion to the total loss incurred on the crop in the insured plot, up to the occurrence of the insured peril.

5. Claims under this cover would be paid as per the modalities defined in **Para 21.7** “Claim Settlement under Multiple Events of similar or different Perils” by considering Wild Animal Attack similar to a Localized calamity.

6. If the loss due to add-on cover happens mid-season, claim for the same should be paid to the farmer first by the Insurance Company or through the corpus as the case may be. In case the add-on cover is implemented through corpus fund, the Insurance Company implementing PMFBY shall be replenished by	the	corpus fund for the additional claim liability under Add-on cover after payment of eligible claims under normal PMFBY.

3. **Deﬁne Coverage Level:**

   1) **Estimation of the Area Insured (in ha):** The area insured for the ensuing season would be based on the previous year area insured. However, as perbest judgment and concurrent situation, States may adjust estimated area insured by \+/- 10% of previous year area insured.

   2) Estimated area insured as per (a) above for current season-year will be multiplied with sum insured (Rs./ha) to arrive the Expected Sum Insured (inRs.) for each and every district-crop combination. The district level ExpectedSum Insured (ESI) will be the total of each district-crop combination within the districts.

### **Example given for District 1:**

| District Name | Crop | Estimated Area Insured (in Ha) | Sum Insured (Rs./ha) | Expected Sum Insured (in Rs.) |
| ----- | :---: | :---: | ----- | :---: |
| A | B | C | D | E=C\*D |
| District 1 | Crop1 | 725 | 10,000 | 72,50,000 |
| District 1 | Crop2 | 700 | 4,000 | 28,00,000 |
| **District 1 Expected Sum Insured (in Rs.)** |  |  |  | **1,00,50,000** |

In the similar manner calculate Expected Sum Insured (ESI) in Rs. for all the districts.

3) Calculate1/3 and 2/3 Percentile values of Expected Sum Insured (ESI) for entire district within State. Deﬁne Coverage Level as per following percentilevalues:

| Low | District ESI \< 1/3 percentile value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Medium | District ESI \>= 1/3 and \< 2/3 percentile values |
| High | District ESI \>= 2/3 percentile value |

| 1/3 percentile value | 3500000 \= PERCENTILE(District ESI, 1/3) |
| :---- | :---- |
| 2/3 percentile value | 8833333 \= PERCENTILE(District ESI, 2/3) |

| District Name | Expected Sum Insured (in Rs) | Coverage Level |
| :---- | :---: | ----- |
| District 1 | 1,00,50,000 | High |
| District 2 | 90,00,000 | High |
| District 3 | 85,00,000 | Medium |
| District 4 | 10,00,000 | Low |
| District 5 | 7,00,000 | Low |

| Risk Level | Coverage Level | Code |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| High Risk | High Coverage | 1 |
| Medium Risk | High Coverage | 2 |
| Low Risk | High Coverage | 3 |
| High Risk | Medium Coverage | 4 |
| Medium Risk | Medium Coverage | 5 |
| Medium Risk | Low Coverage | 8 |
| Low Risk | Low Coverage | 9 |

   4) ### **Allocation of codes to different districts:**

      * Arrange the districts in any order.

      * Write risk level and coverage level corresponding to each district.

      * On the basis on above code table allot codes to each district.

      * Arrange the districts in ascending order of allotted codes.

      * Write ESI against each district in next column and arrange ESI in descending order of the district within the same code.

### **Illustration:**

| District Name | Expected Sum Insured (in Rs.) | Risk Level | Coverage Level | Code |
| :---- | ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| District 1 | 1,00,50,000 | High Risk | High | 1 |
| District 2 | 90,00,000 | High Risk | High | 1 |
| District 3 | 85,00,000 | Medium Risk | Medium | 5 |
| District 4 | 10,00,000 | Low Risk | Low | 9 |

| Cluster 1 |  | Cluster 2 |  | Cluster 3 |  |
| ----- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **District Name** | **ESI (in Rs)** | **District Name** | **ESI (in Rs)** | **District Name** | **ESI (in Rs)** |
| District 1 | 1,00,50,000 | District 2 | 90,00,000 | District 3 | 85,00,000 |
|  |  | District 4 | 7,00,000 | District 5 | 10,00,000 |
| Total | 1,00,50,000 |  | 97,00,000 |  | 95,00,000 |

For other codes, the distribution may be done to achieve balancing of ESI.

5) ### **Make suitable minor changes in the distribution of districts to clusters for achieving the objective of clustering.**

**Applicable conditions for Clustering/Clubbing of districts:**

1. Within the cluster, Insurance Companies would be required to quote the premium rates for all district-crop combination for their bids to be evaluated.

2. Company not quoting even for one of the total district-crop combinations within the cluster would be disqualiﬁed from the bidding period.

3. There would be no further negotiations with the L1 bidder to accept L1 rates ofother bidder for any district crop combination i.e. the rates quoted by the L1bidder for different district-crop combination would be applicable within the cluster. Bidding and negotiation conditions will be as per Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) guidelines vide its circular nos. No.005/CRD/012 dated 03rd March 2007 & No.005/CRD/012 dated 20th Jan 2010\.

4. L1 bidder shall not be permitted to surrender partial clusters/districts. If anycompany declines after being declared L1, the company may be barred to implement crop insurance scheme for the coming 1 season in the concernedState and the L2 may be given the cluster for implementing the crop insurance scheme at L1 district-crop combination rates and soon to L3, L4 bidder as per the consent of insurance company. Such bidders will be required to furnish appropriate reasons for withdrawal/surrender in writing to Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Government of India within  
   10 days from opening of the bids to enable further corrective measures and appropriate administrative & legal action against defaulting bidders.

### **Selection of Implementing Agency:Illustration:**

| Weighted Premium Rate (%) for companies |  |  |
| ----- | :---: | :---: |
| **Company X** | **Company X** | **Company X** |
| 0.044289 | 0.046435 | 0.044221 |
| 4.43% | 4.64% | 4.42% |

**L1 in Cluster1 is Company Z.** Similar process would be followed other clusters.

### **Method 2**

Agriculture output in the area/ district is inﬂuenced by the agro-climatic conditions of that area/district. On the basis of the variation in agriculture output (crops) in each district during the last 10 years, districts may be divided into three categories of low, moderate and high risks to agriculture. If variation in agriculture output in the district during the last 10 years worked out to be plus minus\<15% then district may be categorized as low risk. Similarly, districts of variation ranging plus minus 16-30% may be categorized of moderate risks and variation of plus minus \>30% as high risks districts to agriculture operations. Accordingly, all districts of the State would be identiﬁed as low/moderate/high risk. Number of clusters to be formed shall be decided according to total no. of districts in the State. Total no. of each category of low, moderate and high risks districts shall be divided by no. of clusters to be formed in the State. Then, equal no. of low-risk districts shall be selected randomly for each cluster of districts. Similarly, moderate and high risks districts would be selected.

### **Example:**

State- UP, No. of districts \- 75

Based on the last 10 years variation in output, category-wise No. of districtsidentiﬁed:

Low risks 40, Moderate risks 20, High risks 15,

No. of clusters (of preferably 15-20 districts each) to be formed: 75/19 \=3.95 say 4 Then, no. of low risks districts in each cluster: 40/4 \= 10  
Similarly, moderate risks districts: 20/4=5 and high risks districts:15/4=3.75 say4 as such Sample calculation to ﬁnd L1:

| Actions required to be validated by STAC | Data Requirements |
| :---- | :---- |
| Any dispute related to Final Yield (AY Values) being referred to STAC by Insuranec Companies of DLJC, DGRC or SGRC shall be validated against the below parameters to ensure that the dispute qualifies to be considered at STAC level: There is more than 25% difference between the yield estimated by the State/UT Government and the Insurance Company.  There is sufﬁcient documentary evidence that the CCEs have not been conducted in the required numbers and as per the standard protocol, in at least 20% IUs for a particular crop in a given district or 20% of total planned CCEs for the particular crop in the given district.  The matter has been considered by DGRC and/or SGRC but could not be resolved at those levels. | Data to be provided by State/UT Government &/or TIP:  All yield assessment survey or CCE data of the contested area, in digital format, (preferably Excel), along with photographs and other collateral data, as collected during yield assessment survey or CCEs. The yield assessment survey or CCE data should ideally be geo referenced. Village level crop area estimates. |
| The Insurance Company has already carried out the technical analysis of the data in consultation of the State Government/UT Administration or in collaboration with Central/State/empaneled agencies and has used satellite/model/ weather data to support its objection. | Long term (at least 10 years) data of crop yield at GP level (if not available, at least at Taluka/block level) in digital format, (preferably Excel). Long term (at least 10 years) data of weather parameters (daily or weekly) at GP level (if not available, at least at Taluka /block level). The weather parameters should cover at least, rainfall, rainy days and temperature, in digital format, (preferably Excel). Any information about pest/disease attack, hailstorm, cyclones, inundations, heavy rainfall or any other natural/ manmade disasters in that area. Report of any analysis carried out by the State/UT to support its claim. |
|  | Data to be provided by Insurance Company: Data of the co-observed yield assessment survey or CCEs collected by Insurance Comapnies in digital format, (preferably Excel), along with photographs   and   other |

|  | collateral data, as collected during yield assessment survey or CCE. Data	of	weather observatories\*, if maintained or sourced by Insurance Company, in the contested area. Report of the technical studies\* carried out by the Insurance Company to support its claim. Detailed reasons for the yield data	being	perceived	as contested.
