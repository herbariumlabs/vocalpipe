1. **Objective of the Scheme**

   Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture sector by way of \-

   1) providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events

   2) stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming

   3) encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices

   4) ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture sector; which will contribute to food security, crop diversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides protecting farmers from production risks.

2. **Coverage of Farmers**

1. All farmers including sharecroppers and tenant farmers growing the notified crops in the notified areas are eligible for coverage. However, farmers should have insurable interest for the notified/ insured crops. The non-loanee farmers are required to submit necessary documentary evidence of land records prevailing in the State (Records of Right (RoR), Land possession Certificate (LPC) etc.) and/ or applicable contract/ agreement details/ other documents notified/ permitted by concerned State Government (in case of sharecroppers/ tenant farmers).

2. *Compulsory Component*

   All farmers availing Seasonal Agricultural Operations (SAO) loans from Financial Institutions (i.e. loanee farmers) for the notified crop(s) would be covered compulsorily.

3. **Coverage of Crops**

1) Food crops (Cereals, Millets and Pulses),

2) Oilseeds

3) Annual Commercial / Annual Horticultural crops

4. **Coverage of Risks and Exclusions**

1. Following stages of the crop and risks leading to crop loss are covered under the scheme.

   1) **Prevented Sowing/ Planting Risk:** Insured area is prevented from sowing/ planting due to deficit rainfall or adverse seasonal conditions

   2) **Standing Crop** (Sowing to Harvesting): Comprehensive risk insurance is provided to cover yield losses due to non- preventable risks, viz. Drought, Dry spells, Flood, Inundation, Pests and Diseases, Landslides, Natural Fire and Lightening, Storm, Hailstorm, Cyclone, Typhoon, Tempest, Hurricane and Tornado.

   3) **Post-Harvest Losses:** coverage is available only up to a maximum period of two weeks from harvesting for those crops which are allowed to dry in cut and spread condition in the field after harvesting against specific perils of cyclone and cyclonic rains and unseasonal rains.

   4) **Localized Calamities:** Loss/ damage resulting from occurrence of identified localized risks of hailstorm, landslide, and Inundation affecting isolated farms in the notified area.

2. General Exclusions: Losses arising out of war and nuclear risks, malicious damage and other preventable risks shall be excluded.

5. **Preconditions for implementation of the Scheme**

1. Issuance of Notification by State Government / UT for implementation of the scheme (PMFBY) will imply their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The main conditions relating to PMFBY which are binding on States/ UTs, are as follows:

   1) State has to conduct requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) at the level of notified insurance unit area;

   2) CCE based yield data will be submitted to insurance company within the prescribed time limit;

   3) State/ UT will make necessary budgetary provision in State/ UT budget, to release premium subsidy based on fair estimates, at the beginning of the crop season;

   4) State/ UT should be willing to facilitate strengthening of weather station network.

   5) Adoption of innovative technology specially Smart phones/hand held devices for capturing conduct of CCEs.

2. Department of State Government already looking after implementation of National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS)/ National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP) may be designated as Nodal Department for implementation of PMFBY. The State Level Coordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI) presently overseeing implementation of NAIS and NCIP may be authorized to oversee implementation of PMFBY. The States/UTs which have not implemented the NAIS / NCIP shall constitute SLCCCI for implementation of PMFBY on the lines similar to that of NAIS/NCIP. The present composition of SLCCCI may be strengthened by including representatives from State Horticulture Dept., State Remote Sensing Application Centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Farmers’ Representatives and Empanelled Insurance Companies for implementing PMFBY. Chairman of SLCCCI shall co-opt representatives from other departments / agencies, if considered necessary.

6. **Notification**

1. Prior to the commencement of the crop year, preferably in the beginning of February, meeting of SLCCCI should be convened for finalising various terms and conditions and calling of bids/ issuance of the bid notice to select insurance companies and carrying out implementation of the scheme during the bid/ risk period. State Government / UT should ensure the issuance of the notification and its circulation to all concerned agencies/ departments/ institutions at least one month in advance of the commencement of the crop season incorporating all the essential details about insured crops, areas, Scale of Finance, Sum Insured, threshold at insurance unit (IU) level for notified crops, Premium rate for farmers, subsidy along with seasonality disciplines/ cutoff date for each activities etc..

   Notification of crops, areas and Implementing Agency (IA)

2. a)  The Scheme shall operate on the principle of “Area Approach” in the selected Defined Areas called Insurance Unit (IU). State Government /UT will notify Crops and Defined Areas covered

   during the season in accordance with decision taken in the meeting of SLCCCI. State/UT Government should notify as an insurance unit, Village/Village Panchayat or any other equivalent unit for major crops. For other crops it may be a unit of size above the level of Village / village Panchayat.

   b)  For the claims arising out of crop damage due to post-harvest losses and localized risks, assessment of damage will be made on individual farm basis as outlined in para XIV and XV respectively.

3. SLCCCI will, for the purpose of notification, consider factors such as availability of past yield data based on CCEs for adequate number of years (atleast 10 years), cropped acreage and for estimating yield during proposed season, etc.

4. State Government/ UT should provide 10 years historical yield data to Insurance Companies for calculation of indemnity limits, threshold yield, calculation of premium rates etc. at insurance unit area and in absence of above, data at next higher unit/ nearest neighboring unit/ weighted average of contiguous units as decided by the SLCCCI shall be used. The level and name of notified areas of insurance unit will be part of notification and should be provided at the time of bidding itself. Minimum two week time should be available for filing bid document by the designated / empanelled insurance companies.

5. In case it is proposed to notify irrigated and un-irrigated areas separately under a crop, State Government / UT shall ensure that minimum CCEs are planned and conducted for irrigated and un-irrigated crops, separately in such areas. In addition, past yield data for adequate number of years will have to be made available separately.

6. State implementing PMFBY at Village/ Village Panchayat level shall be entitled for 50% reimbursement of incremental expenses of CCEs and cost of smart phones/ improved technology from Government. Only eligible items will be considered for reimbursement.

   Notification of indemnity level, Average Yield, Threshold Yield, Sum Insured (SI) and Premium Rates

7. Three levels of Indemnity, viz., 70%, 80% and 90% corresponding to high, moderate and low risk level of the areas shall be available for all crops. SLCCCI in consultation with Insurance Companies shall approve indemnity levels for notified crops and areas at sub-district or district level.

   The Average Yield of a notified crop in insurance unit (IU) will be average

   yield of last seven years excluding upto two declared calamity years). The Threshold yield of the notified crops is equal to Average Yield multiplied by Indemnity level. SI and Premium Rates will be notified.

   Notification of calamity year(s), if any for calculation of threshold yield

8. If the State Government/ UT declares calamity year(s) in respect of any district/ area based on decision/ notification made for that year by concerned Government/ competent authority, such calamity year(s) will be excluded while calculating threshold yield at insurance unit level, and also ‘Notional Threshold Yield’ at sub-district/ district level, sum insured (scale of finance) etc. Not more than two such years shall be excluded from calculation of threshold yield, even in instances where calamity years are more than two during the preceding seven years. The yield in declared calamity year is not expected to be reported higher than the normal years. However if it is so, then that year shall not be considered as a calamity year for calculation of Threshold Yield for the season. Further, Threshold Yield once notified in the Notification issued by the State should not be changed at later stage under any circumstances. However, based on actual yield, Threshold Yield and Sum Insured for the later years may be recalculated and notified accordingly at the beginning of each crop season.

   Seasonality discipline

9. State Government/ UT shall also notify seasonality discipline for various activities under the scheme viz. submission of insurance proposals, consolidated declarations by banks, yield data, claim assessment of losses for (i) standing crop (ii) localized calamities, (iii) prevented sowing,

   (iv) post harvest loss, (v) on-account payment for major calamities, etc as per the provisions of the scheme.

   Farmers, States, Insurers and Banks. Detailed outlines of Crop Insurance Portal for administration of Crop Insurance Programme along with its phases, functions and role and responsibilities for entry of data/information etc under different phases are at Para XXV. The basic information like notified areas, crops, Sum Insured, Government subsidy, premium to be paid by farmers, and concerned insurance companies in the particular insurance unit of has been digitized and put on the web portal so that Farmers and other stakeholders may get the relevant information on Internet and through SMS. Further, to ensure better administration and ease in accessing information by farmers, an android based “crop insurance **app”** has also been launched which could be downloaded from either the website of DAC & FW or Google play Store.

   The Government is also endeavouring for the integration of all the stakeholders viz, farmers, insurance companies, financial institutions and Government agencies on an IT platform to ensure better administration, coordination and transparency for getting real time information and monitoring etc. in a phased manner in consultation with Ministry of Finance and other stakeholders.

   State Government and concerned IAs will be responsible for entry of all requisite information/ data as per notification issued by the States in the crop Insurance portal well in time so that information may be available in digitized form to all stakeholders. The details of entry of data/ information on the web portal have already been available on the portal (www.agri- insurance.gov.in). State Government and concerned IAs will be responsible for any wrong entry/ errors/ omissions etc.

7. **Sum Insured /Coverage Limit**

related to implementation of the Scheme and utilization of Government funds and to share/ disseminate the same among the concerned insurance companies and Governments for better planning, implementation and monitoring of the scheme.

c) Government (both Central and States) may release 50% of the total estimated premium subsidy to empanelled insurance companies at the beginning of crop season on the basis of business projection to be submitted by each insurance company subject to fulfillment of General Financial Rule/ guidelines in the matter.

4\.	Claim Liabilities:

# **Insurance company shall take all necessary steps to take appropriate reinsurance cover for their portfolio in order to safeguard insured’s interest. In case premium to claims ratio exceeds 1:3.5 or percentage of claims to Sum Insured exceeds 35%, whichever is higher, at the National Level in a crop season, then Government will provide protection to IAs. The losses exceeding the above mentioned level in the crop season would be met by equal contribution of the Central Government and the concerned State/ UT Governments. The liability of payment of all claims shall however be of the concerned IAs only. In case of unfulfilment of above mentioned condition, States/ UTs where the losses exceed the above ceiling level insurers shall be responsible to settle the admissible claims.**

9. **Seasonality Discipline**

   1. The cut-off date is uniform for both loanee and non-loanee cultivators. The State-wise cut off dates for different crops shall be based on Crop Calendar of major crops published from time to time by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Government of India. The latest copy of the Crop Calendar is available on the website of Directorate of Economics and Statistics at [http://eands.dacnet.nic.in/PDF/Agricultural-Statistics-At-Glance2014.pdf](http://eands.dacnet.nic.in/PDF/Agricultural-Statistics-At-Glance2014.pdf) (The crop calendar is elaborated in Appendix IV). However, besides prevailing agro-climatic conditions, rainfall distribution/irrigation water availabilities, sowing pattern etc. the SLCCCI, in consultation with the insurance company shall fix seasonality discipline of the coverage and other activities in such a way that it does not encourage adverse selection or moral hazards. The broad seasonality discipline is given in the chart below:

| Sl. No. | Activity | Kharif | Rabi |
| ----- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Issuance of Administrative Instructions by Government of India. | February | August |
| 2 | Conduct of SLCCCI meeting to decide for notification of Crops and Notified areas, limits of Sum Insured, and adoption of Level of Indemnity etc. | March | September |

| 11 | Cut-off date for receipt of yield data harvest | Within a month from final |
| 12 | Processing, Approval and Payment of Final Claims based on yield data | Three weeks from receipt of yield data |

2. Further, in case of three crop / season pattern, a modified discipline keeping in mind the overall seasonality discipline prescribed above, shall be adopted by State Level Co-ordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI).

   3. **Keeping in mind the specialty and catastrophic nature of crop insurance, SLCCCI shall fix seasonality in such a way that it does not encourage adverse selection or moral hazards and also ensure early payment of claims to eligible insured farmers. Scheme also has provisions of claims due to prevented sowing and option to change the insured crop. Hence, State Government will take all necessary steps to ensure enrolment of farmers well within the stipulated time under the scheme.** No relaxation for extension in the above seasonality/cut off dates shall be considered / granted by this department once it is fixed and notified for the crop season however, pre-ponement in cut off dates shall be considered on case to case basis. If any state/ UT extends the above seasonality/ cut off dates on their-own then central share of premium subsidy shall not be available for the concerned notified crops / areas.

   4. It may be noted that neither DAC & FW nor any State/ UT Government will

      # as Nodal branch for this purpose. **The concerned Lead bank and Regional offices/ Administrative offices of commercial banks/ RRBs will provide necessary guidelines to concerned bank branches and coordinate with them to ensure that all concerned branches submit the consolidated proposals to insurance companies well within the stipulated cut-off dates and also upload the soft copy of insured details in crop insurance portal. Besides, insurance company may also use the IRDA approved insurance agents/ insurance intermediaries for the coverage of non-loanee farmers only**.

2. Declaration/ proposal formats to be submitted by Nodal banks/ Branches shall contain details about Insurance Unit, sum insured per unit, premium per unit, total area insured of the farmers, number and category of farmers covered (small and marginal or other) and number of farmers under other categories (SC/ ST/ others) / Women along with their bank account details etc. (bank / their branches) **as per the format envisaged / provided in the crop insurance portal.**

   Loanee farmers (Compulsory coverage)

3. Whenever banks sanction loan for a notified crop in a notified area, the crop loan amount only to the extent of **Scale of Finance for notified crops** and acreage of individual notified crops of loanee farmers shall be taken into consideration for compulsory coverage, as per seasonality discipline. Based on seasonality of Crops, banks should separately calculate the eligibility of loan amount for both Kharif and Rabi seasons based on the scale of Finance and declared acreage under notified crops. Disbursing bank branch/ Primary Agriculture Cooperative Society (PACS) will prepare monthly statement of crop-wise and insurance unit-wise details of crop insurance with premium as per the seasonality discipline. Loan disbursing bank branch/ PACS will finance the additional loan towards premium amount payable by farmer for crop insurance.

4. Crop loans through Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) are covered under compulsory coverage and banks shall maintain all back up records and registers relating to compliance with PMFBY and its seasonality discipline and cut-off-date for submitting Declarations in case of normal crop loans. Bank branch will apportion coverage among insurable crops, based on acreage mentioned in loan application or on the basis of actual area sown as declared by the farmer subsequently.

5. Bank branches of commercial banks and RRBs/ Nodal Bank in case of PACS under its jurisdiction shall consolidate insurance proposals/ statements from their bank branch/ PACS under its jurisdiction,

	  
		

respectively and forward the same to insurance company along with details of remittance/ RTGS towards insurance premium, in accordance with cut off dates, as specified by SLCCCI for that particular crop and season.

Non-loanee farmers (Optional coverage) through Channel partners

6. Farmers desirous of availing insurance shall fill up Proposal Form of the Scheme and submit the same to nearest bank branch or authorized channel partner or insurance intermediaries of insurance company.

7. In case channel partner is a Bank, farmers will submit duly filled up proposal form in the village branch of a Commercial Bank (CB) or Regional Rural Bank (RRB), or PACS (DCCB) with requisite insurance premium amount. Operating a bank account is essential for such cases. Branch/ PACS officials will assist the farmers in completing the insurance proposal form and provide necessary guidance. While accepting the proposal and premium, Branch/ PACS will be responsible for verification of eligible sum insured, applicable premium rate, etc. PACS will thereafter consolidate these particulars and send them directly/ to respective Nodal Banks respectively which will, in turn, submit crop-wise and insurance unit-wise Crop Insurance Declarations in the prescribed format, along with the premium, within the stipulated time, to insurance company. However the bank branches of commercial banks/ RRBs will directly submit the consolidated proposals along with details of insured farmers in the format envisaged in the crop insurance portal within the stipulated time.

8. Non-loanee cultivators could also be serviced directly by any designated agencies, other authorized channel partners or insurance intermediaries, approved by the IRDA for the purpose and they will act as a guide and facilitator wherein they will advise them the benefits and desirability of the Scheme and guide the farmers through procedures; collect requisite premium and remit individual/ consolidated premium to insurance company, accompanied by individual proposal forms and summary details in Declarations/ Listing sheet (MIS), provide soft copy to IA and details of each insured farmer and will also upload the data directly to the crop insurance portal.

9. While accepting the Proposal and the premium from aforesaid, designated agents, other authorized channel partner or insurance intermediaries, approved by the IRDA, **it shall be the responsibility of Insurance Company or its designated agents to verify insurable interest and collect the land records, particulars of acreage, sum insured, crop sown etc. and applicable contract/ agreement details in case of share**

   **croppers/ tenant farmers.** The designated intermediaries shall remit the premium with consolidated proposals within 7 days. However, it is mandatory that the Non-loanee cultivators serviced by the designated intermediaries should hold a bank account in order to facilitate remittance of the claim, if payable.

   Non-loanee Farmers (Optional coverage) \- directly to Insurance companies

10. Non-Loanee farmer may submit insurance proposals personally / through post to insurance company with requisite premium. Non-loanee farmer can also avail insurance through ‘on-line portal’ of concerned insurance company or crop insurance portal designed by Government for the purpose. However, it is mandatory that Non-Loanee farmers, personally submitting proposals to insurance company or through crop insurance portal, should have insurable interest and submit necessary documentary evidence as proof as decided by SLCCCI (like print copy of application along with remittance of premium). The insured farmer forfeits the premium and the right to claim (if any) if the material facts furnished in the proposal form are wrong or incorrect.

11. Insurance companies retain the right to accept or reject insurance proposal(s) in case proposal is incomplete, not accompanied by necessary documentary proof or insurance premium ordinarily, within one month of receipt of proposal by Insurance Companies. If the proposal is rejected the insurance company will refund full collected premium.

    Option for change of crop name

12. Farmers covered, on voluntary basis, can buy insurance before actual

    certificate is not permissible. Bank will ensure that all standard loans sanctioned for notified crops within stipulated cut-off date should compulsorily be covered.

13. Declarations/ proposals received from the Banks/ PACS after the cut-off date shall be summarily rejected and the liability, if any, for such declarations shall rest with the concerned bank. Therefore, the Banks/ PACS must not receive any proposal after the cut-off date of coverage. The Banks/ PACS must also ensure that the consolidated statement alongwith the premium amount is remitted to the insurance company within the stipulated time, failing which they shall be responsible for payment of claims, if any to the farmers. However, any dispute in the matter may be referred to the Department by the concerned State/ Agency.

14. The concerned branches of banks and Nodal Banks/ DCCBs in case of PACS will also collect the list of individual insured farmers (both loanee and non-loanee) with requisite details like name, father’s name, Bank Account number, village, categories – Small and Marginal/ SC/ ST/ Women, insured acreage, details of insured land, insured crop(s), sum insured, premium collected, Government subsidy etc. from concerned branch in soft copy also for further reconciliation and send the same to the concerned insurance company within 15 days after final cut-off date for submission of Proposal/ Declaration to insurance company and also upload the same on the crop insurance portal. Same standard format of crop insurance portal will be utilized.

15. Insurance companies may also collect the requisite information in respect of non-loanee farmers from the channel partner in same formats. It is the responsibility of the concerned insurance companies to collect/obtain the details of the insured farmers (both loanee and non-loanee) from the bank/financial institutions/ intermediaries/ agents and facilitate the banks to upload the same on crop insurance portal.

16. Insurance Companies should also verify and be satisfied themselves about the coverage of farmers/ crops and up-load the same in their websites within a month preferably before approaching the Government to release the final installment of subsidy under the scheme.

11. **Assessment of Loss / Shortfall in Yield**

    Wide Spread Calamities (based on season-end yield)

    1. The Scheme operates on the basis of ‘Area Approach’ i.e., Defined Areas for each notified crop for widespread calamities and insurance unit is

       Village/ Village Panchayat or any other equivalent unit for major crops and for other crops it may be a unit of size higher than Village/ Village Panchayat level, to be decided by the State/ UT Government. State Government Department overseeing conduct of CCEs will submit yield data as per cut-off date decided by SLCCCI, along with results of individual CCEs. Yield data will be furnished to Insurance Company by State Government / UT, in accordance with the cut-off dates fixed, and crops and areas notified, based on total number of CCEs being conducted.

    2. CCEs shall be undertaken per unit area of insurance per crop, on a sliding scale, as indicated below:

| Sl. No. 1 | Level of Insurance Unit of CCEs District | Minimum sample size  24 |
| :---- | :---- | ----- |
| 2 | Taluka/ Tehsil/ Block | 16 |
| 3 | Mandal/ Phirka/ Revenue Circle/ Hobli or any other equivalent unit | 10 |
| 4 | Village / Village Panchayat | 4 for major crops and 8 for other crops |

    3. In order to maintain the sanctity and credibility of CCEs as an objective method of yield estimation, the modalities mentioned below will be followed:

       1) State shall strengthen audit process of conduct of CCEs, with necessary checks and balances. Digitizing the CCE process including geo-coding (providing the latitude and longitude of the CCE location), date/ time- stamping and with photographs (of the CCE plot and CCE activity), is a must for all CCEs. ( Refer para 7\)

       2) Wherever external agencies are proposed to be used for conducting the CCEs (i.e. CCEs are out-sourced), it should be given only to the registered ‘professional’ agencies with adequate experience in agriculture field activities/ yield estimation. It is mandatory for these agencies to follow the digital protocol as mentioned in the previous paragraph. Services of such agencies may also be utilized for assessment of Post-harvest loss and losses due to localized risks.

       3) States shall maintain ‘single series’ of CCEs, i.e. the same set of CCEs and Yield estimates are used both for Crop Production estimates and Crop Insurance.

       4) In instances where required number of CCEs could not be conducted due to non-availability of adequate cropped area, the yield estimate for such IUs can be generated by using methods as (i) clubbing with neighboring/ contagious units or (ii) adopting yield estimate of next higher unit, or (iii) adopting the yield of neighboring IU with maximum correlation. Priority of applicability of aforesaid three methods should be notified by the concerned States well in advance

       5) The yield estimates at IU level shall be submitted by the State Government within the cut-off date, along with results of individual CCEs to the insurance companies.

       6) Insurance company should be given complete access to co-witness the CCEs, as also the digital images of the CCEs and relevant data in the requisite form by the State Government. (as outlined in para XXIV.2.m) A formal letter with the schedule should be given to the IAs sufficiently in advance without fail to help them mobilize the manpower if they so desire.

       7) Wherever the yield estimates reported at IU level are abnormally low or high vis-à-vis the general crop condition, the insurance company in consultation with State Government can make use of various products (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, etc.) derived from satellite image data or other technologies to confirm the yield estimates. In case of significant differences between these two yield estimates, the matter should be referred to Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) at Centre and its decision shall be final. For resolving such cases, services of the Mahalobanis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC) may be availed by TAC. MNCFC shall examine the above mentioned both the estimates and indicate their views on the yield estimate at IU for the crop season applying technology and other related parameters.

    4. Use of Innovative Technologies to Rationalize CCEs

       With availability of a number of satellites with high resolution images orbiting the Earth, there has been a great improvement in satellite imagery products. It has been reasonably proven that satellite imagery can help in demarcating the cropped areas into clusters on the basis of crop health. This feature can be successfully used to target the CCEs within the Insurance Unit (IU). In other words, satellite imagery can help in **‘smart sampling’** of CCEs. While an IU with heterogeneous crop health may need standard sample of CCEs, say 4 CCEs per Village / Village Panchayat, the more homogenous IU may need a lesser sample size, say 2 CCEs. This is expected to minimize the total CCEs needed by about 30-40%. States can adopt this technique (of using satellite based remote sensing data for

       planning of crop cutting experiments) in generating yield estimates while following digital protocol outlined in the preceding paragraphs. For using satellite data for smart sampling, there is need to generate specific crop map. Vegetation Indices need to be computed for the cropped area. On the basis of Vegetation Index, the crop area can be categorized into poor, medium, good and very good crop health strata. Within each stratum, CCE points should be selected randomly. This can be done in consultation with MNCFC and IASRI.

    5. Use of Technology to remove area discrepancy in coverage

       It is noticed that in some instances in States/districts, area insured is much more than area sown figures resulting in reduction of sum insured and consequently reduction in claims of farmers. Use of RST/ satellite imagery, digitization of land records may be promoted to minimize the area discrepancy. (Refer para XVII.4)

    6. Use of Innovative Technologies for Direct Yield Estimation

       1) For addressing the problem of reliability of CCEs as well as their accuracy and speed of conducting them, innovative technologies such as RST, drone, online transmission of data etc. will be utilized. This will ensure accurate assessment and timely payments of claims of farmers. The World Bank and MNCFC based on some pilots in this regard recommended that images/ video capture of crop growth at various stages and transmission thereof with CCE data on a real time basis utilizing mobile communication technology with GPS time/ date stamping, can improve data quality/ timeliness and support timely claim processing and payments. This Department has also been piloting such studied in this regard for assessment of crop loss at lower unit level.

       2) After adequate number of pilots when a strong correlation between RST/ Satellite Image derived products results and yield estimates through CCEs has been seen, States and Insurance companies may use these technologies in estimating the crop yields at IU level, subject to the satisfaction of both States and insurance companies about the accuracy of the yield estimates, to service the claims.

    7. Use of Mobile Phone Technology to improve Yield-data Quality and Timeliness

       It has been felt that CCE process currently being conducted by the State for estimating yield is lacking in reliability, accuracy and speed which affects the claims settlement. There is a need to have good quality, timely and

       reliable yield-data. To increase the reliability, accuracy and speed of CCE data, mandatory use of smart phones / hand held devices for capturing images, location of the CCE and for online transmission of data on centralized server (eg Bhuvan server) would be done for faster compilation of data and quick claim settlement. RST and Drones etc. may also be used for the purpose of increasing accuracy and speed of yield estimation through CCEs.

    8. The cost of using technology etc. for conduct of CCE process specially purchase of smart phones/ hand held devices will be shared between Central Government and State/ U.T. Governments on 50:50 basis, wherever necessary, subject to a cap on total funds to be made available by Central Government for this purpose based on approximate cost of procuring hand held devices/ Smart phones and other related costs.

    9. The existing Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) comprising of representatives from Indian Agricultural Statistical Research Institute (IASRI), State Remote Sensing Centres, National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO), Central Statistical Organization (CSO), DAC & FW and insurance company (AIC) may review sample size of CCEs from time to time. TAC shall also review any other technical matters related to conduct of CCEs and timely submission of yield data.

       Assessment of Claims (Wide Spread Calamities)

    10. If ‘Actual Yield’ (AY) per hectare of insured crop for the insurance unit (calculated on basis of requisite number of CCEs) in insured season, falls short of specified ‘Threshold Yield’ (TY), all insured farmers growing that crop in the defined area are deemed to have suffered shortfall in yield of similar magnitude. PMFBY seeks to provide coverage against such contingency.

        ‘Claim’ shall be calculated as per the following formula: (Threshold Yield \- Actual Yield)

        ——————————————— X Sum Insured Threshold Yield

        Where,

        Threshold yield for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of past seven years (excluding a maximum of two calamity year(s) as notified by State Government/ UT) multiplied by applicable indemnity level for that crop.

    11. Illustration

        In table below, assumed yield of wheat for the last 7 years is given for insurance unit area of “X”. Calculation of TY for Rabi 2014-15 season is as under:

| Year | 2008-09 | 2009-10 | 2010-11 | 2011-12 | 2012-13 | 2013-14 | 2014-15 |
| :---- | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: |
| Yield (kg/ha) | 4500 | 3750 | 2000 | 4250 | 1800 | 4300 | 1750 |

        The years of 2010-11, 2012-13 and 2014-15 were declared natural calamity years.

        Total of yields of seven years is 22350 kg/ha and that of two worst calamity years is 3550 kg/ha i.e. (1800+1750). Therefore according to the provision, average of past seven years excluding maximum two calamity years will be (22350–3550=18800/5) i.e. 3760 kg/ha. Hence, threshold yield at 90%, 80% and 70% of indemnity levels will be 3384 kg/ha, 3008 kg/ha and 2632 kg/ha respectively.

12. **On Account Payment of Claims due to Mid-Season Adversity**

    1. It is proposed to provide immediate relief to insured farmers in case of adverse seasonal conditions during the crop season viz. floods, prolonged dry spells, severe drought etc., wherein expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of Threshold yield.

       1) # **Eligibility Criteria**:

          1. All notified Insurance Units would be eligible for “ON ACCOUNT” payment only if the expected Yield of the affected crop during the season is less than 50% of threshold yield.

          2. The provision is invoked by the State Government through damage notification based on the proxy Indicators.

          3. The provision could be invoked for a specific crop or group of crops in Notified Insurance Unit, depending on fulfillment of laid down conditions.

          4. Insurance company may decide the quantum of likely losses and the amount of ‘on-account’ payment based on the joint survey of Insurance Company and state government officials.

          5. Only those farmers would be eligible for financial support under this cover who has paid the premium / the premium has been debited from their account before the damage notification by the state government invoking this provision for compensation.

          6. Maximum amount payable would be 25% of the likely claims, subject to adjustment against final claims.

          7. If adversity occurs within 15 days before the normal harvest time, this provision will not be invoked.

       2) **Proxy-Indicators**: Indicators to be used for loss intimation could be rainfall data, other weather data, satellite imagery and crop condition reports by district level state government officials, supported by media reports. The State’s notification should also spell out all the necessary details in this regard.

       3) # **Loss assessment procedure**:

          1. Joint committee of State Government and the insurer for assessment of crop damage, has to be formed and notified before start of the crop season by the SLCCCI for each district.

          2. This Joint Committee shall decide the eligibility for on-account payment based on the weather data (available AWS notified by the Government)

       /long term average rainfall data/satellite imagery supported by estimated yield losses at notified Insurance unit level. Loss intimation order has to be issued within 7 days from the adverse seasonal event.

          3. Based on the above report, a joint inspection of the affected area may be done by Insurance Company for ground truthing with State government officials and arrive at the extent of loss.

          4. Information/ Services of Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC) may also be utilized for determination of extent of loss for on- Account payout.

          5. If the expected loss of the affected crop is more than 50% of the normal yield for the Notified Insurance Unit, on-account payment would be payable.

          6. On-account payment would be calculated as per following formula: (Threshold Yield \- Estimated Yield)

       ———————————————— × Sum Insured ×25%

          Threshold Yield

       4) # **Time frame for loss assessment and submission of report:**

1) An order will be issued by State Government defining eligibility of on- account payment with details of damaged Insurance Units within 7 days from the occurrence of adverse seasonal event.

2) Loss assessment report at the affected insurance unit level has to be completed by the joint committee within 15 days from occurrence of the adverse seasonal event.

   5) # **Conditions:**

      1. Mere disbursement/ sanction of loan without receipt/ debit of premium before the notification of calamity would not make a farmer eligible for the claim.

         2. The On-account payment would be disbursed by the insurance company only after the receipt of Government share of premium subsidy.

         3. On- account payment would be paid to all eligible insured farmers within one month of the notification invoking this provision by the State Government and subject to receipt of loss report from State Government.

         4. These claims would be adjusted from the end season area approach yield based claims.

   2. Illustration

      District ‘A’ has been affected by floods having 100 insurance units under Crop ‘X”. Out of which 50 insurance units were severely affected and as per the weather indicators / agro-met data, it has been assessed that 30 insurance units could have yield loss of more than 50% (compared to the threshold yield). Out of these 30 insurance units, estimated yield loss for 5 units is 80% (Category-I), for another 10 units, it is 70% (Category-II) and remaining 15 units, it is 60% (Category-III) of normal average yield. As per declarations received, if sum insured for notified areas in Category-I, Category-II and Category-III is Rs. 1 crore, Rs. 2 crore, and Rs 3 crore, respectively, then likely total claims will be Rs. 80 lakh, 140 lakh and 180 lakh, respectively. Hence on-account claims upto 25% shall be Rs. 20 lakh, 35 lakh and 45 lakh, which will be released during the season subject to receipt of premium subsidy.

13. **Prevented / Failed Sowing and Prevented Planting / Germination Claims**

    1. It is proposed to provide insurance cover to farmers in case of widespread incidence of eligible risks (para IV.1.a) affecting crops in more than 75% of area sown in a notified unit at early stage leading to total loss of crop or the farmers are not in a position to either sow or transplant the crop.

       The precondition for this cover is issuance of notification of the scheme before commencement of normal sowing process and details of insurance

coverage from banks should have been advised to Insurance Company.

1) # **Eligibility Criteria**:

   1. The State Government would provide Notified Insurance Unit and crop wise normal area sown at the beginning of the season within 15 days.

      2. Notified Insurance Units will be eligible for “Prevented Sowing/ Planting” pay-out only if more than 75% of Crop Sown Area for notified crop remained unsown due to occurrence of any of the above perils.

         3. The provision is invoked by the State Government through notification based on the proxy Indicators.

         4. Only those farmers would be eligible for financial support under this cover who have paid the premium / the premium has been debited from their account before the notification by the state government invoking this provision for compensation.

         5. The State Government would notify crop wise and agro-climatic zone or district wise cut off dates by which, this provision could be invoked.

      2) **Proxy-Indicators**: Indicators like rainfall data, other weather data, satellite imagery and crop condition reports by district level State Government official, media reports and area sown data released by State Government

      3) # **Loss assessment procedure**:

         1. State Government would declare a Notified Insurance Unit as having suffered Prevented or Failed Sowing/ Planting conditions with approximate areas in percentage of the unit.

      company only after the receipt of Government share of premium subsidy.

5. Insurance Cover would terminate for the affected crop in a Notified Insurance Unit once a claim under this section is invoked and the Affected Insurance Unit/ Crop would not be eligible for area yield based claim calculated at the end of the season.

6. This provision would be needed to be invoked within the cut-off date as notified by the state government, beyond which if invoked, no claim would be payable.

7. Once this provision is invoked, no fresh enrolment of farmers for the affected notified crops and areas would be done.

8. Once exigency is invoked it applies to all the insured farmers in the Notified Insurance Unit for a given crop, including for those whose crop survived.

   2. Illustration

      District ‘B’ with 100 insurance units has been affected by dry-spell at the beginning of crop season, consequently about 80% of the area could not be sown in about 50 insurance units for groundnut crop, where per hectare sum insured is Rs. 20,000. As per provision of payment for prevented sowing, the benefit payable is sum insured X 25%, which on a sum insured of Rs. 20,000 works out to Rs. 5000 in the 50 insurance units which have more than 75% area which could not be sown.

14. **Post-Harvest Losses**

    1. It is proposed to provide for assessment of yield loss on individual plot basis in case of occurrence of cyclone, cyclonic rains and unseasonal rains throughout the country resulting in damage to harvested crop lying in the field in ‘cut and spread’ condition up to maximum period of two weeks (14 days) from harvesting for sole purpose of drying.

       1) # **Eligibility criteria**:

          1. Available to all insured farmers, at farm unit level, affected by above mentioned perils in a Notified Insurance Unit growing notified crops for which insurance have been availed.

          2. Available for all crops damaged by specified perils, which are left in the field after harvesting in “cut and spread condition” for drying up to a period of 14 days from harvest.

       2) **Proxy-Indicators**: Report in the local media or reports of the agriculture/ revenue department supported by media reports and other evidences.

       3) # **Loss assessment procedure**:

       **Time and method of reporting the loss/claims**

          1. Immediate intimation (within 48 hours) by the insured farmer to any one as detailed below.

          2. Intimation must contain details of survey number-wise insured crop and acreage affected.

          3. Premium payment verification to be reported in next 48 hours by the farmer/Bank.

       # **Whom to be reported i.e. Channel of reporting:**

       Intimation may be given within 48 hours by farmer either directly to the insurance company, concerned bank, local agriculture department government/district officials or through toll free number *(Centralised dedicated Toll Free Number for claim intimation/ intimations can be redirected to respective Insurance Companies through backend)* to the insurance company. First mode of intimation will be centralised Toll Free Number. In absence of such a facility, the report can be given to banks or Government officials and the same would be forwarded/ intimated to the insurance company immediately. The banks would verify the insured details like crop insured, sum insured, premium debited and date of debit before sending the same to insurance company.

       # **Documentary evidence required for claim assessment,**

             * Duly filled Claim form along with all relevant documents is requisite for payment of claims. However, if information on all the columns is not readily available, semi-filled form may be sent to the insurance company and later within 7 days of the loss, filled form may be submitted.

             * Local Newspaper cutting and any other available evidence to substantiate occurrence of loss event and severity of the loss, if any.

       # **Appointment of Loss Assessors by the Insurance Company**:

       The loss assessors would be appointed by the insurance company for assessment of losses due to the operations of Post-harvest losses (Yield Insurance). The loss assessors appointed should possess following experience and qualification:

       # **Time frame for loss assessment and submission of report**

1) Appointment of loss assessor within 48 hours from receipt of information

2) Loss assessment to be completed within next 10 days

3) Claim settlement/ payment to the farmers to be completed in next 15 days (subject to receipt of premium) from loss assessment report.

   4) If the affected area under a notified crop is more than 25% of the total insured area in a notified insurance unit, all the eligible farmers (who have taken insurance for the notified crop, which has been damaged, and informed about occurrence of calamity in the farm within the stipulated time) in the notified insurance unit would be deemed to have suffered post harvest loss and would be eligible for financial support. Percentage of loss would be arrived at by requisite percentage of sample survey (as decided the Joint Committee) of affected area by the insurance company.

      5) If the claim on area approach (based on CCEs) is more than the claims of

      company only after the receipt of Government share of premium subsidy.

4. The insurance company would disburse the claim, if payable within 30 days of receipt of loss survey report.

   2. Illustration

      1) Sum Insured for a crop \= Rs. 50,000

      2) Affected area of the I.U. \= 80% ( eligible for sample survey )

      3) Assessed loss in the affected area/fields due to operation of insured peril \= 50%

      4) Claims Payable under Post Harvest loss \= Rs. 50,000 ×50% \= Rs 25,000

      5) End of season reported shortfall in yield \= 60%

      6) Claim estimated based on ‘area approach’ at IU level \= Rs. 50,000 ×60% \= Rs. 30,000

      Balance payable at end of season \= Rs. 30,000 \- Rs. 25,000 \= Rs. 5,000

15. **Localized Risks**

    1. It is intended to provide insurance cover at individual farm level to crop

4. Maximum pay-out under this provision would be in proportion to cost of inputs, incurred up to the occurrence of insured peril, subject to the sum insured. If the payout under area approach (based on CCEs data) is more than localized losses, the higher claims of two will be payable to insured farmers.

5. If the affected area under a notified crop is more than 25% of the total insured area in a notified insurance unit, all the eligible farmers (who has taken insurance for the notified crop, which has been damaged, and informed about occurrence of calamity in the farm within the stipulated time) in the notified insurance unit would be deemed to have suffered localised loss and would be eligible for financial support. Percentage of loss would be arrived at by requisite percentage of sample survey (as decided the Joint Committee) of affected area by the insurance company.

2) **Proxy-Indicators**: Report in the local media or reports of the Agriculture/ Revenue Department.

3) # **Loss assessment procedure**:

   **Time and method of reporting the loss/claims**

      # **Documentary evidence required for claim assessment,**

      * Duly filled Claim form along with all relevant documents is requisite for payment of claims. However, if information on all the columns is not readily available, semi-filled form may be sent to the insurance company and later within 7 days of the loss, filled form may be submitted.

      * Evidence of crop loss through capturing pictures using mobile application, if any.

      * Local Newspaper cutting to substantiate occurrence of loss event and severity of the loss, if any.

      # **Appointment of Loss Assessors by the Insurance Company**:

      The loss assessors would be appointed by the insurance company for assessment of losses due to the operations of Localized Risks (Yield Insurance). The loss assessors appointed by the insurance companies should be in accordance with the IRDAI provisions. The loss assessors appointed should possess following experience and qualification:

1) Any Graduate (preferably Agriculture i.e. Diploma / B.Sc. (Ag.)) with minimum 2 years experience of crop insurance.

2) Retired Government officials of Agriculture/ Horticulture/ Extension Department having Diploma / B. Sc. (Ag.) degree.

2) Retired Bank officials with experience of crop loaning or Kisan Credit Card

   * Maximum liability would be limited to proportionate Sum Insured of damaged cropped area.

4) # **Conditions:**

   1. Mere disbursement/sanction of loan without receipt/debit of premium before the occurrence of insured peril would not make a farmer eligible for claim.

   2. When affected area is limited upto 25% of total insured area in the notified insurance unit, the losses of eligible farmers would be assessed individually provided they have paid premium prior to occurrence of insurance peril.

   3. The pay-out under the cover would be disbursed by the insurance company only after the receipt of Government share of premium subsidy.

   4. The insurance company would disburse the claim, if payable within 30 days of survey of loss.

   6. Farmers getting enrolled or whose premium is debited after occurrence of insurance peril would not be eligible for financial support under this cover.

   7. Bank would remit farmers premium with farmers list within 7 days of intimation of loss under this section, if not sent earlier.

   2. Illustration

2. In case of widespread calamity (end of season claims ), once yield data is received from State Government as per the cut-off-dates decided, claims will be worked out as per Declarations/ proposals received from banks / channel partners / insurance intermediaries for each notified area and crops and claims will be approved by Competent Authority of Insurance company i.e. Implementing Agency (IA).

3. In case of farmers covered through Financial Institution, claims shall be released only through electronic transfer, followed by hard copy containing claim particulars, to individual bank branches/ nodal banks; and banks branches/ PACs at grass root level, will credit into accounts of individual farmers within a week of receipt of funds from the Insurance companies and shall provide a certificate to the insurance companies alongwith list of farmers benefited. Bank Branch should also display particulars of beneficiaries on notice board and also upload the same on crop insurance portal.

4. In case of farmers covered on voluntary basis through intermediaries, payable claims will directly credited to the concerned bank accounts of insured farmers and details of the claims may also intimated to them. The list of beneficiaries may also be uploaded on the crop insurance portal immediately.

5. In case of claims under prevented/failed sowing, localized calamities, post- harvest losses; insurance company will process the claims after assessment and shall release the claims as per procedure given in the relevant sections above.

6. Insurance companies shall resolve all the grievances of the insured

2. In case of any substantial misreporting by nodal bank /branch in case of compulsory farmers coverage, the concerned bank only shall be liable for such mis-reporting.

3. Mere sanctioning/ disbursement of crop loans and submission of proposals/ declarations and remittance of premium by farmer/ bank, without explicit intent to raise the crop, does not constitute acceptance of risk by insurance company.

4. Acreage discrepancy

   Some areas in the past have reported excess insurance coverage vis-à-vis planted acreage, leading to over-insurance. Ideally the discrepancy should be handled at farm level to protect the interest of farmers with genuine insurance coverage. All suitable measures should be taken by concerned stakeholders for de duplication with the help of land records, banks records, revenue records and proposal/loan application of insured farmers. However, in the absence of digitized farm records on a GIS platform, it would be cumbersome to physically verify each farm when the reported discrepancies are comparatively large compared to the sown areas. For the time-being, it is to be addressed as follows:

   1) Wherever the ‘acreage discrepancy’ is likely, the acreage insured at IU level **shall be compared with average planted acreage of past three years, and the difference is treated as ‘excess’ insurance coverage after taking into account sown area data of the Revenue authority.**

   2) Sum insured is scaled down in the proportionate ratio the average of three years’ actual planted acreage bears to the insured acreage for the given crop.

18. **Publicity and Awareness**

    1. Adequate publicity needs to be given in all the villages of the notified districts/ areas. All possible means of electronic and print media, farmer’s fair, exhibitions, SMS, short films, and documentaries shall be utilized to create and disseminate awareness about benefits and provisions of the Scheme among the cultivators and the agencies involved in implementing the Scheme. Agriculture/ Cooperation Departments of the State in consultation with Insurance Companies shall work out appropriate Plan for adequate awareness and publicity three months prior to the start of coverage period. All the published material information should necessarily be uploaded on the crop insurance portal along with coverage/ frequency / duration date etc..

    2. The State Government/ UT in collaboration with Insurance Companies shall also chalk out plan for capacity building of the associated agents, banks etc for effective implementation of the scheme and organize training workshops/ sensitization programme for them in association with participating insurance companies.

19. **Commission and Bank Charges**

    Bank and other financial institutions etc. shall be paid service charges @ 4% of the premium collected from farmers. Rural agents engaged in providing insurance related services to farmers may be paid appropriate commission as decided by the insurance company, subject to cap prescribed under IRDA regulations.

20. **Service Tax**

    PMFBY is a replacement scheme of NAIS/MNAIS, and hence exempted

    programme in their states. However, a National Level Monitoring Committee (NLMC) under the chairmanship of Joint Secretary (Credit), DAC & FW will monitor the scheme at the national level.

2. It is proposed to take following monitoring measures for effective implementation during each crop season to ensure maximum benefits to the farmers:

   1) The Nodal Bank(s)/ intermediaries may collect the list of individual insured farmers (both loanee and non-loanee) with requisite details like name, fathers’ name, Bank Account number, village, categories – Small and Marginal/ SC/ ST/ Women, insured acreage, insured crop(s), sum insured, premium collected, Government subsidy etc from concerned branch in soft copy for further reconciliation and send the same to the concerned insurance company along with declarations of farmers within 15 days after final cut-off date. This will be done online once the integrated e platform is put into place. Yield data based on CCEs shall be made available to the concerned insurance company by the state government within a month from the date of final harvest.

   2) After receiving the claims amount from the concerned Insurance Companies, the financial institutions/banks should remit/transfer the claim amount to the account of beneficiaries farmers within a week and also display the list of the beneficiaries (both loanee and non-loanee) on the notice board of the branch within seven days with details of beneficiaries like Name of farmers/ beneficiaries, crops insured, sum insured, amount of claims received etc. and send a copy to concerned insurance companies with utilization certificates within 15 days for further verification and audit. This will be transferred online directly by the Insurance company into the accounts of farmers once the integrated platform is functional.

   3) The list of the beneficiaries (Bank-wise and insured area-wise) may also be uploaded/ placed on the crop insurance Portal and website of the concerned insurance companies with proper provisions and mechanisms of public grievance redressal/ feed-back etc.

   4) About 5% of the beneficiaries may be verified by the Regional Offices/ local level Offices of Insurance Companies who will send the feed back to concerned District Level Monitoring Committee (DLMC) and State Government/ State Level Coordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI).

   5) At least 10% of the beneficiaries verified by the insurance company may be cross verified by the concerned District Level Monitoring Committee

	

(DLMC) and they should send the feed back to State Government.

6) 1 to 2% of the beneficiaries may be verified by the Head Offices of the insurance company/ Independent Agencies appointed by the Central Government/ National Level Monitoring Committee and they should send the necessary feed back to Central Government.

23. **Participation of Insurance Companies in Implementation of the Scheme**

    Empanelment Criteria

    1. The public sector (AIC) and private sector General Insurance Companies empanelled by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare (DAC & FW), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare (MOA and FW), Government of India (GOI) and selected by concerned State Government / Union Territory (UT) shall implement the PMFBY. The Insurance Companies mainly engaged in agriculture/rural insurance business and having adequate experience, infrastructure, financial strength and operational capabilities are empanelled by DAC & FW. **Once Insurance Company has been empanelled by DAC & FW, it is considered as pre-qualified company to bid for the selection of Implementing Agency (IA) to undertake implementation of the Scheme / Programme of DAC & FW.**

       Selection Criteria of Insurance Companies as Implementing Agency (IA)

    2. The selection of insurance company from the designated/ empanelled insurance companies to act as Implementing Agency (IA) shall be done by the concerned State/ UT Government for implementation of the scheme in their State. Selection of IA will be made by adopting the cluster approaches explained in the succeeding paragraphs. In case of smaller States, the whole State may be assigned to one IA.

    3. Before the commencement of the crop season, **State Government would invite the pre-qualified companies as mentioned in the preceding para through the open tender for submission of district-wise and crop-wise actuarial premium rates (financial bid).** Indemnity Level, Threshold Yields, Sum Insured etc. will be same for all insurance companies for the season. The designated / empanelled companies participating in bidding have to bid the premium rates for all the crops notified / to be notified by the State Government and non-compliance will lead to rejection of the bid.

    4. Based on the district-wise and crop-wise actuarial premium rates quoted by the pre-qualified companies, the total premium amount and weighted average premium rates at cluster of districts (preferably 15-20 districts) will be worked out to arrive at L1. L1 Bidder will be selected to act as IA in the concerned cluster.

    5. Selection of IA may be made for upto three years however, the State government/ UT and the concerned insurance company are free to renegotiate the terms if relevant. This will facilitate the insurance company to establish the credibility among the farmers through investment out of the premium savings in various welfare activities for socio-economic development of the farmers like creation of the facilities of drinking water/ health care/ education, farm leveling, no claim bonus, Weather Forecasts, common Service Centers etc. It is also anticipated that long term continuity gives an opportunity to Insurers, Bankers, State Government and other stakeholders for a supportive and collaborative interaction and business relationship and service effectiveness.

    6. The insurance coverage in terms of number of farmers and hectare-age should be at least at the previous season’s level otherwise, insurance company shall be liable to be de-barred for next bidding in the State.

    7. State Government may ensure that only one insurance company operates in each district or notified area for all farmers.

    8. **Clustering/Clubbing of districts for bidding by the state**:

       In order to diversify/ spread the risk and cover high risk/ low risk districts/ area equally, the State Government would group the districts in such a way that each group contains mix of districts with different risk profiles. Prior to inviting the bid, the State Government would divide the state in to multiple clusters of preferably 15-20 districts each. While clustering/clubbing following criteria would be followed

       1) States may form the clusters of districts based on mixed agro-climatic zones.

       2) Prior to the bid invitation, details on the clusters formation would be made available to the insurance companies.

       # **Clustering/ Clubbing of districts would be done to achieve the following objectives:**

1) Cluster formation may be applicable for upto 3 years and clusters may be formed preferably having 15-20 districts.

2) Different Clusters may be defined based on risk profile of the district so as to increase the diversification of risk within a cluster and enable risk spreading for insurer.

3) Cluster may contain districts with mixed agro-climatic zones so as to increase the diversification of risk within a cluster.

4) Crop wise associated risk may also be diversified among the clusters and not concentrated within the cluster.

   9. # **Two illustrations using different methods of clustering/clubbing of districts and determination of L1 bidder are given below. These are only for guidance of States and States are free to follow either of these or any other method devised by them with intimation to DAC & FW.**

   **Method 1**

      # **Define Risk Level**

1. Calculate Loss Cost for each district as per illustration given for District1, Notified Area 1 (NFA1) and Crop1, on the basis of immediate past ten years of yield data:

   1. Calculate Threshold yield as defined in the scheme.

   2. Calculate loss cost for each year

      *Threshold Yield – Actual Yield*

# **Define Coverage Level**

1. **Estimation of the Area Insured (in ha):** The area insured for the ensuing season would be estimated on the basis of previous years the districts within state based on the fair judgment. The State Government would project area insured for the ensuing season for each district-crop combination.

   # **Illustration: for District 1 with two crops would be estimated**

| District Name | Crop | Latest available Area Sown (ha) | Area Insured in Normal Previous Year (in ha) | Existing Penetration (%) | Targeted Penetration (%) \* | Estimated Area Insured (ha) |
| ----- | :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** | **E \= D / C** | **F** | **G \= C \* F** |
| District 1 | Crop1 | 2900 | 300 | 10% | 25% | 725 |
| District 1 | Crop2 | 1400 | 490 | 35% | 50% | 700 |

   \* Targeted penetration percentage (%) can be decided according to the associated potentiality of the district and other relevant parameters.

   2. Estimated area insured for current season-year will be multiplied with sum insured (Rs./ha) to arrive the Expected Sum Insured (in Rs.) for each and every district-crop combination. The district level Expected Sum insured (ESI) will be the total of each district-crop combination within the districts.

Example given for District 1:

| District Name | Crop | Estimated Area Insured (in Ha) | Sum Insured (Rs./ha) | Expected Sum Insured (in Rs.) |
| :---- | :---- | :---: | ----- | ----- |
| **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** | **E \= C \* D** |
| District 1 | Crop1 | 725 | 10000 | 7250000 |
| District 1 | Crop2 | 700 | 4000 | 2800000 |
| **District 1 Expected Sum Insured (in Rs.)** |  |  |  | **10050000** |

3. In the similar manner calculate Expected Sum Insured (ESI) in Rs. for all the districts.

   4. Calculate 1/3 and 2/3 Percentile values of Expected Sum Insured (ESI) for entire district within state. Define Coverage Level as per following percentile values:

| Coverage Level | Percentile |
| :---- | :---- |
| Low | District ESI \< 1/3 percentile value |
| Medium | District ESI \>= 1/3 and \< 2/3 percentile values |
| High | District ESI \>= 2/3 percentile value |

| 1/3 percentile value | 3500000	\= PERCENTILE(District ESI,1/3) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 2/3 percentile value | 8833333	\= PERCENTILE(District ESI,2/3) |

| District Name | Expected Sum Insured (in Rs.) | Coverage Level |
| :---- | ----- | :---- |
| District 1 | 10050000 | High |
| District 2 | 9000000 | High |
| District 3 | 8500000 | Medium |
| District 4 | 1000000 | Low |
| District 5 | 700000 | Low |

   # **Allocation of Rank exposure level (code) to districts**

| Risk Level | Coverage Level | Code |
| :---- | :---- | ----: |
| High Risk | High Coverage | 1 |
| Medium Risk | High Coverage | 2 |
| Low Risk | High Coverage | 3 |
| High Risk | Medium Coverage | 4 |
| Medium Risk | Medium Coverage | 5 |
| Low Risk | Medium Coverage | 6 |
| High Risk | Low Coverage | 7 |
| Medium Risk | Low Coverage | 8 |
| Low Risk | Low Coverage | 9 |

2. Allocation of codes to different districts:

   1. Arrange the districts in any order.

   2. Write risk level and coverage level corresponding to each district.

   3. On the basis on above code table allot codes to each district.

   4. Arrange the districts in ascending order of allotted codes.

   5. Write ESI against each district in next column and arrange ESI in descending order of the district within the same code.

      # **Illustration:**

| District Name | Expected Sum insured(in Rs.) | Risk Level | Coverage Level | Code |
| ----- | :---- | :---- | ----- | :---: |
| District 1 | 10050000 | High Risk | High | 1 |
| District 2 | 9000000 | High Risk | High | 1 |
| District 3 | 8500000 | Medium Risk | Medium | 5 |
| District 4 | 1000000 | Low Risk | Low | 9 |

|  | **10050000** |  | **9700000** |  | **9500000** |

c.	For other codes, the distribution may be done to achieve balancing of ESI.

3. Make suitable minor changes in the distribution of districts to clusters for achieving the objective of clustering.

   # **Applicable conditions for Clustering/ Clubbing of districts:**

1. Within the cluster insurance companies would be required to quote premium rates for all district-crop combination for their bids to be evaluated.

2. Company not quoting even for one of the total district-crop combinations within the cluster would be disqualified for the bidding period.

3. There would be no further negotiations with the L1 bidder to accept L1 rates of other bidder for any district crop combination i.e. the rates quoted by the L1 bidder for different district-crop combination would be applicable within the cluster.

4. If any company declines after being declared L1, the company may be barred for the coming season and the L2 may be given the cluster for implementing the crop insurance scheme at L1 district-crop combination rates and so on to L3, L4 bidder as per the consent of insurance company.

**L1 in Cluster1 is company (Z)**. Similar process would be followed other clusters.

**Method 2**

Agriculture output in the area/ district is influenced by the agro-climatic conditions of that area/ district. On the basis of the variation in agriculture output (crops) in each district during the last 10 years, districts may be divided into three categories of low, moderate and high risks to agriculture. If variation in agriculture output in the district during the last 10 years worked out to be plus minus \<15% then district may be categorized as low risk. Similarly, districts of variation ranging plus minus 16-30% may be categorized of moderate risks and variation of plus minus \>30% as high risks districts to agriculture operations. Accordingly all districts of the State would be identified as low / moderate / high risk.. Number of clusters to be formed shall be decided according to total no. of districts in the State. Total no. of each category of low, moderate and high risks districts shall be divided by no. of clusters to be formed in the State. Then, equal no. of low risk districts shall be selected randomly for each cluster of districts. Similarly, moderate and high risks districts would be selected.

Example:

State– UP, No. of districts – 75

Based on the last 10 years variation in output, category-wise No. of districts identified:

Low risks 40, Moderate risks 20, High risks 15,

No. of clusters (of preferably 15-20 districts each) to be formed: 75/19 \=

3.95 say 4

Then, no. of low risks districts in each cluster: 40/4 \= 10

| Clusters |  | Formation of clusters |  |  Total districts in cluster |
| ----- | :---- | ----- | ----- | :---- |
|  | **No. of low risks districts** | **No. of moderate risks districts** | **No. of high risks districts** |  |
| C 1 | 10 | 5 | 4 | 19 |
| C 2 | 10 | 5 | 4 | 19 |
| C 3 | 10 | 5 | 4 | 19 |
| C 4 | 10 | 5 | 3 | 18 |

Similarly, moderate risks districts: 20/4 \= 5 And high risks districts: 15/4 \= 3.75 say 4 As such,

10. Assessment	of	Performance	and	De-empanelment	of	Insurance Companies

    # **The performance of the empanelled insurance companies shall be closely monitored by DAC & FW on 3 years interval through ascertaining the company’s skills and efficiencies for providing cost effective better insurance services to farmers. For the purpose, 4 indicators based on the company’s risk-underwriting ability, coverage enhancement, fiscal skills and strength, payouts, promptness in claim settlement have been evolved. These indicators have equal weight age and are (i) Percentage of actual area insured to total cropped area in the allocated districts / areas (ii) Percentage of area insured of non-loanee farmers to total area insured (iii) Percentage of claims paid to total admissible claims within the stipulated time (iv) Percentage of own-retention of risk insured (SI) to total risk insured. The percentage of the indicators as mentioned above will be worked out based on the business performance achieved by the company at national level in previous three years (6 crop seasons) (excluding immediate preceding season). If the total points of performance so arrived are found below 180 i.e. 45% of the total of 400, the said insurance company is liable to be de-empanelled. Detailed instructions in this regard will be issued separately.**

1. The Government is endeavoring for the integration of all the stakeholders viz. farmers, insurance companies, financial institutions and Government agencies on single IT platform to ensure better administration, coordination and transparency for getting real time information and monitoring in a phased manner in consultation with Ministry of Finance and other stakeholders.

   **The idea behind developing a web-based, integrated IT solution is to speed up service delivery, unify fragmented databases, achieve a single view of data, eliminate manual processes and thus provide insurance services to farmers faster than before.** Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmer Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India has designed a web portal for crop insurance ([www.agri-insurance.gov.in)](http://www.agri-insurance.gov.in/) and doing further enhancements to

provide a single IT enabled platform for digitization of process and documentations, information data bank and dissemination mechanism, automation of administrative procedures, premium and claim calculation and remittance etc. This IT driven system is envisaged to address the issues which affect the current system of program administration and thereby reduce its efficacy and lead to denial/delay in benefit transfer to farmers viz. selective/layered information access, manual interventions, multi-step procedures, documentary avoidances/proofs, delayed/defective information sharing. Hence, integration of IT platforms of banks, Insurance Companies, State Governments and yield/weather data providers with Crop insurance web portal directly or through interface for fetching in information is felt essential to avoid errors, timely transmission of requisite information amongst major stakeholders, early settlement of claims, proper monitoring and transparent administration of the schemes. Once the entire linking of IT platforms of all stakeholders with the Web portal is established, it would also lead to faster processing of claims due to electronic flow of information. Currently, this portal is available in two languages – Hindi and English and it will be converted into all regional languages.

The aforesaid portal will provide an integrated ecosystem to streamline the process and to automate administrative functions. A web-based, integrated IT solution has been developed which has opened a window of opportunity to remote and economically-weak farmers to benefit from crop insurance services.

The project is divided into several steps which are envisaged to be developed and launched into two phases. Phase-1 has already been developed and made functional and necessary action is being taken for development of remaining component of Phase-2.

# **Phase 1:**

1) Digitization of notification of areas, crops, schemes across two seasons of Kharif and Rabi for enabling information access to multiple stakeholders viz. Farmers, Government Functionaries, Insurance Companies, Intermediaries, Bankers and social and community bodies. This phase has been developed and launched and the relevant information of coverage of areas, crops, seasons and schemes is readily available on the portal. Detailed user manual for uploading the requisite input/information by concerned State Governments, Insurance companies have already been circulated and information in respect of Kharif 2015 and Rabi 2015-16 has successfully uploaded for digitization of crop insurance information.

   Filling/uploading of requisite information on the crop insurance portal by

the State Government and Insurance Companies is compulsory so that farmers and other stakeholders can get timely information about crop insurance, premium cut off dates and insurance companies. This information is available through various modes like web, mobile app and SMS in order to cover all sections of rural masses.

**State Government and concerned IAs will be responsible for entry of all requisite information as per notification issued by the States in the crop Insurance portal.** The details about data entry are available on the portal ([www.agri-insurance.gov.in).](http://www.agri-insurance.gov.in/) Therefore, State Government and Insurance companies may take necessary action well in advance so that requisite information may be made available to the stakeholders from the start of loaning/coverage period itself. State Government and concerned IAs will be responsible for any wrong entry/errors/omissions etc.

2) Creation of Insurance Premium Calculator for enabling Farmers and other stakeholders to know details of the schemes, crops, sum insured, premium amount, Implementing Agency etc. This information is also made available through USSD (non-internet based mobile technology for accessing web based information). This phase has already been developed and launched for usage. To provide information of crop insurance for a particular area in a customized form, this Department has also developed an **Android based Mobile app “Crop Insurance”** to get detailed information of any particular notified/insured areas along with premium calculator. This would be helpful for the banks in obtaining faster information etc. The Crop Insurance app can be downloaded from either Google play Store or www.agri- insurance.gov.in or [www.mkisan.gov.in.](http://www.mkisan.gov.in/) This app is available in English and Hindi as of now and will be made available in all languages very soon. **This mobile app was launched on December 23, 2015 and within less than two months, 6115 downloads of this app have happened.**

   3) Online submission of application forms by the farmers especially for non- loanee farmers for getting insurance coverage through designated bank branches. Farmer can fill up the online application form available on crop insurance portal ([www.agri-insurance.gov.in)](http://www.agri-insurance.gov.in/) and select the bank branch of commercial banks/RRBs/DCCBs for payment of requisite premium. A farmer can submit the application through authorized Common Service Centre as well. **As soon as the application is submitted through the system, a unique identification number is generated and SMS would be sent on farmer’s mobile.** This unique number will be used to identify the beneficiaries. The print out of application or this unique identification number is to be submitted to the selected branch along with requisite premium. An option to modify the application is also given.
