## **Procurement of materials for nursery activities:**

**Objectives:** One model nursery at Byrnihat is running satisfactorily producing quality and genuine planting materials of Litchi, Guava, Assam lemon, Mango, Sweet orange etc. and supplying the same to various agencies/farmers. Secondly, one V-type automated nursery for producing quality vegetable seedlings has also been established at Ulubari with an annual capacity of 50 lakh seedlings. One 'Model Floriculture Unit' has also been established at Sarutary which needs regular maintenance. Similarly a 'Centre of Excellence' on flower and vegetables also established at Khetri for dissemination of modern technologies to the farmers' In order to maintain and run these units successfully some inputs of importance are regularly required which are to be procured under the scheme. The Orchid units at Byrnihat, Juripar and Khetri have proved to be good demonstration unit and encourage many young entrepreneurs to take up floriculture as a profession. The plants under the units have become old and unproductive. Hence, they are to be replaced with new plants to keep the units running.
