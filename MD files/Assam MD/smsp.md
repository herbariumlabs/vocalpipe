# **OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES ON SUB-MISSION ON SEEDS AND PLANTING MATERIAL (SMSP) UNDER NATIONAL MISSION ON AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AND TECHNOLOGY (NMAET)**

1. **INTRODUCTION :**

Agriculture and allied sector accounts for 14% of the country’s GDP, 13% of overall exports and provides employment to over 50% of the work force in the country. Being both a source of livelihood and food security for a vast majority of the population, its performance assumes great significance for poverty reduction and gender equality. In order to achieve this objective, various schemes & programmes have been launched by the government with emphasis on improving farm productivity, enhancing agricultural research, education and extension enabling development, infusion of appropriate technologies and improving the conditions of farming community on sustainable basis.

The production of foodgrains during 2012-13 was at **255.36** million tonnes, comprising of **128.20** million tonnes during Kharif season and **127.16** million tonnes during the Rabi season. Of the total foodgrains production, production of cereals was **236.92** million tonnes and pulses **18.45** million tonnes.

A Central Sector Scheme ‘Development and Strengthening of Infrastructure Facilities for Production and Distribution of Quality Seeds’ is being implemented on all India basis from the year 2005-06 aiming at ensuring production and multiplication of high yielding certified/quality seeds of all crops and making them available to the farmers. Although the existing scheme has contributed in doubling the availability of quality seeds in the country during the last 5 years, a need has been felt to upgrade and expand the existing scheme into a Mission mode in order to include new/emerging technologies in production of quality/certified seeds, improve seed testing laboratories, support seed producing agencies in adopting new seed producing technologies etc. It will improve the availability of quality seeds to the farmers and at a reasonable price in a time bound manner.

Accordingly, during the XII Plan, a Sub-Mission for Seed and Planting Material (SMSP) under National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology (NMAET) will be implemented. SMSP will cover the entire gamut of seed production chain, from production of nucleus seed to supply of certified seeds to the farmers, to provide support for creation of infrastructure conducive for development of the seed sector, support to the public seed producing organisations for improving their capacity and quality of seed production, create

dedicated seed bank to meet unforeseen circumstances of natural calamities, etc. The other Central Sector Scheme implemented by Seed Division, viz., Implementation of PVP Legislation has also been subsumed under the SMSP.

2. # **MISSION TARGETS**

   * Increasing production of certified/ quality seed

   * Increasing SRR more particularly to achieve higher SRR in crops like paddy, gram, groundnut, cotton etc. As follow-up of the recommendations of Consultative Group of the Ministry of Agriculture, the increase in SRR is proposed below:-

     (Quantity in lakh quintal)

| No. | Type | Existing SRR | Proposed SRR |
| :---: | ----- | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | Self-pollinated crops | 25% | 33% |
| 2 | Cross-pollinated crops | 33% | 50% |
| 3 | Hybrids | 100% | 100% |

   * Upgrading the quality of farm saved seeds with specific objective to cover 10% villages and produce 100 lakh quintals of seed each year through farmers participatory seed production.

   * Encouraging seed treatment particularly for farm saved seed.

   * Strengthening the seed multiplication chain through assistance to public and private sector.

   * Popularizing new varieties to encourage varietal replacement.

   * Promoting new technologies and methodologies in seed production, processing, testing etc.

   * Strengthening and modernizing infrastructure for seed production, storage, certification and quality control particularly to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Seeds Bill 2004/ISTA standards, OECD certification.

   * Facilitating movement of seed from India in international trade and increase its share to 10% by 2020 as envisaged in the new policy on seed development.

   * Assisting and supporting public and private seed producing organizations in seed sector and encourage partnerships.

   * Ensuring availability of seed in contingent situations.

   * Facilitating dissemination of seed related information through information, education and communication.

   * To provide an effective system for protection of plant varieties, the rights of farmers as well as plant breeders and to encourage the development of new varieties of plants, through PPV\&FRA.

3. # **MISSION IMPLEMENTATION STRUCTURES**

   Annual Action Plans of States/Implementing Agencies will be approved by the Executive Committee on Seeds (ECS). ECS should also decide the allocation of funds to the States/ Implementing Agencies based on the approved Annual Action Plan. The release of funds shall be done by the DAC and routed through respective State Governments which may transfer funds to designated implementing agencies alongwith the State share of funds. However, funds under PPP project would be released as under:

      1) First Installment on completion of 25% of project	15% of the approved subsidy.

      2) Second Installment on completion of 50% of project----- 20% of the approved subsidy.  
      3) Third Installment on completion of 75% of project	25% of the approved subsidy.

      4) Fourth Installment on completion of 100% of project----- 30% of the approved subsidy.

      5) Fifth Installment on completion of one year of operation of project----10% of the approved subsidy.

   The States would ensure implementation of the programmes, in a time bound manner and would make funds available to the implementing agencies in accordance with their approved programmes. Funds would be released based on the progress reports and submission of utilization certificates.

   The implementing agencies will submit the utilization certificate to the State, which will be compiled and a consolidated utilization certificate, duly authenticated by the State Level Seed Mission Executive Committee (SLEC) will be submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture, for further releases. No amount shall be released to any State Government which defaults in furnishing utilisation certificates and physical progress reports for grants-in-aid released by the Central Government. The unspent balance available with the States and implementing agencies have to be taken into account before further releases are made.

   Implementation agencies must ensure that activities undertaken are within funds released by GOI and corresponding state share.

   *The utilisation certificate shall be submitted in the following prescribed proforma as per GFR \-19.*

   2. # **Procedure for approval :**

   The Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Government of India would communicate the tentative annual outlay to each State. States could engage the technical consultants for preparing the State Seed Plans.
