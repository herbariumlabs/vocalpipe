**PACS Computerisation Project - Guidelines**

# 1 Introduction

The Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) form the vital third tier in the three- tier structure of the Short Term Cooperative Credit Structure (STCCS). The other two tiers are comprised of District Central Cooperative Bank (DCCBs) (2nd tier) and State Cooperative Bank (StCBs) (1st tier). National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), has earlier taken the initiative to bring most of the StCBs and DCCBs on Core Banking Solutions (CBS) platform which has enabled them to give modern-day technology-based banking facilities to their clients. However, the PACS have so far been largely out of the ambit of the technology support.

PACS are owned by farmers, rural artisans etc. and aim at promoting thrift and mutual help among the members; cater to their credit requirements and provide credit-linked services like input supply, storage and marketing of agricultural produce etc. DCCBs provide direct linkages to the PACS through direct financing. The StCBs are primarily responsible for control and coordination of the finances of DCCBs.

The large out-reach of PACS to the Small and Marginal Farmers (SMFs) make them a systemically important class of agricultural credit purveying institutions. Further, there is a felt need to develop cooperatives as vibrant business enterprises by enabling them to provide multiple services to their members with support of technology in order to fulfil members’ requirements.

Keeping in view the above and to make PACS self-reliant in tune with ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan’, the Government of India (GoI) has, on 29th June 2022 approved the Centrally Sponsored Project for Computerisation of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies for a period of five years from 2022-23 to 2026-27.

# 2 Aims & Objectives of the Project

The aims and objectives of the project inter alia include the following:

1.  To bring in efficiency, accountability, transparency at PACS and improve profitability.
2.  To bring in accuracy and uniformity in the conduct of business, accounting with

entries originating at the transaction level and reporting thereof through standardization of processes, implementation of Common Accounting System (CAS) and Management Information System (MIS) and compliance to stipulations.

1.  To transform PACS into multi service entities, offering to members in particular and the rural population in general, an array of services covering agriculture and allied activities; financial and non-financial products.
2.  To seamlessly connect PACS with the higher-tier institutions and Government departments in the domains of agriculture, banking and rural development for dissemination of knowledge to grassroots.
3.  To leverage on the unique strength of PACS i.e. their captive member base, to design and offer personalized products and services and thereby improve the socio-economic landscape of rural India.
4.  To ensure accurate delivery of funds and subsidies through DBT to the targeted beneficiary groups.
5.  To enable PACS to provide doorstep banking services to facilitate easier access to banking services.
6.  To enable PACS to utilize digital acceptance infrastructure like Point of Sale (POS)/ mobile POS (mPoS)/ QR Code Readers/Green Pin solution /BHIM Aadhaar pay device, etc. in the establishments run by PACS like fertilizer shops, Seed Processing units, etc. to facilitate cashless/digital transactions.
7.  To expand financial services to unbanked villages / areas, improve the overall performance and efficiency of PACS and STCCS, increase rural employment opportunities and reduce migration to urban areas.

# 3.9 Basic Architecture of the Project

*   *   1.  One common ERP software will be provided to all the PACS in the project, across the country, to capture data on all functionalities of PACS, both credit and non-credit. This software would be customisable for state specific needs. At the national level, NABARD will engage a vendor namely National Level PACS Software Vendor (NLPSV) to provide the common software including cyber security and data storage through open bidding as per the relevant procurement guidelines.
        2.  NABARD will prepare and publish a central panel of System Integrators (SIs) through open bidding. States are to select the SIs from this central panel with a ceiling on number of PACS that one SI can take up. SIs will prepare legacy data, digitise and port this data into software, recommend state specific customization required in the common software and provide the support system. In the project, there will also be a provision to run the software on offline mode and later upload the data in the system in case of network issue.

PACS in various States are at various levels of computerization. This means that some PACS have been computerised (mostly working on a stand-alone basis) while others not computerised at all. In respect of PACS which have been computerised, expenditure will be reimbursed to States

₹50,000/- per PACS subject to the condition that,

*   *   *   1.  They integrate their software with the National PACS Software,
            2.  Their hardware meets the required specifications and
            3.  The computerization of PACS was commissioned by the State on or after 01 February 2017 i.e. the date of budget announcement by Central Government for computerization of PACS.

PACS which have not been computerised by such states will be taken up under this project at full cost.

For sustainability of the project, maintenance and handholding of the software and hardware is considered critical. For this purpose, the Project envisages a support system by setting up one support centre on an average at cluster of around 200 PACS/ District Level. These support

centres, to be set up by the System Integrator(s), will report to State PMUs which will also serve as State level support centre. This entire support system will be under the overall supervision and control of the State Governments and will be operated by the concerned SI.

States/UTs to procure hardware for the project through Government e- Marketplace (GeM) Portal.

*   *   1.  The basic responsibility of training on use of software will lie with NLPSV. NLPSV will provide necessary inputs to State level SIs and National Level Training Institutions to facilitate creation of trainers at National and State Level. The trainers will be drawn from all training institutions in cooperative sector. After migration to the software, employee(s) of the PACS will be given adequate trainings about functioning of the software and how to work on it. Hands on training will be given through National Council for Cooperative Training (NCCT) institutions and Scheme of Financial Assistance for Training of Cooperative Banks Personnel (SOFTCOB) assisted Institutions like Agricultural Cooperative Staff Training Institutes (ACSTIs) and other Cooperative Training Institutes under the administrative control of State Government. Expenditure on this account will be shared by GoI and NABARD. A training calendar will be prepared by NABARD mapping every PACS under the project.
        2.  For implementation and monitoring of the project, creation of a core team at NABARD, Head Office with the team members constituted from its officers has been envisaged. This core team will be assisted by Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) hired by NABARD for the project. NABARD may hire staff/professional or technical experts for the PMU on contractual basis. Similarly, NABARD will set up state PMUs to assist states in implementation and monitoring of the project at state level, which will also function as the state level support centers. These State PMUs will also be manned by NABARD officials and contractual staff/ experts.

# 3.11 Data Management

The data shall be housed at the National Level Data Repository (NLDR). Data generated at PACS would be routed, either through the DCCBs or State Data Centers, to the National Level Data Repository (NLDR). All data will be shared with/ deposited and maintained at NLDR, in conformity with the rules and regulations. Given availability of connectivity, all data will be available at NLDR level as at the end of the previous day.

The data will be maintained at NLDR and will be available for use by Central Government, State Government and other authorised stakeholders. The data will be utilized to generate various national/ state/ district level reports for Government of India, State Governments, NABARD, StCB, DCCB and other stakeholders, for the purpose of information based effective policy making.

# 3.11 Selection of PACS

*   All functional PACS will be eligible for joining the project. A PACS will be deemed functional if it fulfils the necessary condition i.e. completion of Audit of accounts of PACS for the financial year 2021-22. If the selection is being done in FY 2023-24 or FY 2024-25, then audit of the respective previous year will be the cut-off date for audit.
*   For deciding upon the order in which the eligible PACS are to be taken up under the project, the following norm for prioritization will be followed:
    *   PACS without computerization - priority
    *   PACS with some computerization but needs upgradation - second priority
    *   PACS with computerization achieved through State Govt./ StCBs/ DCCBs – Third Priority
*   The DCCBs/ StCBs will make their selections, based on the allocation, also considering aspects such as prioritising backward areas and ensuring functional sustainability of the project.
*   The selection will be recommended by the DLIMC to the SLIMC. After that, SLIMC will send their final proposal to NABARD for its implementation.

# 8 Deliverables of the Project

# Transparent and Complete accounting System

Accounting as per CAS (Common Accounting System) & MIS (Management Information System) prescribed by NABARD – Origination of accounts on the basis of the member transactions and automation of all the businesses, their business processes and associated calculations for all financial transactions. In an ideal automated accounting system, every single entry, based on transaction of any nature, shall:

*   *   1.  Enable automatic posting and recording in all relevant heads of accounts.
        2.  Be in conformity with all pre-sets like rate of interest, period (including days) of interest applicability, etc.,
        3.  Appropriate amounts to various heads of accounts as per the prescribed priorities.
        4.  Generation of accurate NPA, Interest subvention statements covering the State and Central components and other important & relevant disclosure statements.

# Governance

*   *   1.  Alerts on the conduct of Board Meetings and General Body meetings.
        2.  Prompting on Agenda preparation.
        3.  Record Keeping of Board & General Body Meeting proceedings.
        4.  Real time information flow and access to all stakeholders.

# Enablement

1.  Optimal use of Infrastructure – currently substantial warehouse capacities are being created under Atmanirbhar Bharat program.
2.  Market connectivity – access to the agri-produce information of members can facilitate the institution for procurement, processing and marketing thereof resulting in better price realization to farmers.
3.  Providing multiple financial and non-financial products, citizen services etc.

# 9\. Expected Outcomes of the Project:

1.  PACS functions will be faster, transparent and accountable.
2.  Migration of the legacy data.
3.  Timely generation of MIS.
4.  Improved facilities (credit & non- credit) to members at PACS level.
5.  Financial irregularities can be prevented on time.
6.  Increase in work efficiency of the PACS staff.
7.  Enhanced financial inclusion and business opportunities for the members.

# Statutory Audit

An automated accounting and audit process delivers prompt and accurate audit statements leading to completion of audit within 2 to 3 days from the date of closure of financial accounts (31st March) – the current practice of manual accounting and preparation of audit statements often results in inaccuracies and delays in completing financial audits.

# Transparency in Operations and Productive Manpower Deployment

Further, automation of all the businesses and their business processes will lead to complete transparency and ease of use besides providing quality time for the PACS staff and administration to plan and undertake other profitable businesses and services.

# Integration

Seamless integration with all the relevant governmental agencies and departments and more specifically the higher financing agencies leading to better financial management and account reconciliations.
