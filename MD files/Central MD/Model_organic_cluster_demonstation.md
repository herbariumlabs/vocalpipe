**Implementation guidelines on Model Organic Cluster Demonstration and Model Organic Farm under PKVY scheme.**

### **Introduction:**

Considering the existing potential of organic farming and the future demand for organic produce, the Government is promoting organic farming across the country through the Paramparagat

Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), under National Mission of Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). This is a

centrally sponsored scheme being implemented by the states governments through a cluster approach along with Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) of certification. At present, under this scheme there is no direct involvement of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), Central Agricultural Universities (CAUs), Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), National Centre for Organic Fanning (NCOF) & Regional Centres for Organic Farming (RCOFs) which have good knowledge of organic fanning technologies and have availability of large number of field farms & infrastructure. Accordingly the guidelines have been framed.

**Model Organic Cluster Demonstrations:** \- To promote organic farming among the rural youth, farmers and consumers, there is a need to organize/conduct organic cluster demonstrations under the active supervision of the Experts/Scientists/Subject Matter Specialist (SMS) of the \!CAR Institutions, State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), Central Agricultural Universities (CAUs), Krishi Vigyan Kendras **(KVKs),** Farmers Producers Organizations (FPOs),PGS\-RCs registered with NITI Ayog and other Public Sector Organizations of DAC & FW. This programme will serve as a vehicle through which the latest technologies of organic farming approved under Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana **(PKVY)** scheme can be disseminated among various stakeholders.

1. ### **Objectives of Model Cluster Demonstrations:**

   * To organize/conduct Model organic cluster demonstrations at farmer's field across the

   **country.**

     * To boost/promote organic farming among rural youth/farmers/consumers/traders.

     * 	To disseminate the latest technologies of organic farming in one or more clusters approved under Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana **(PKVY)** scheme.

     * 	To utilize the services of well qualified experts of ICAR Institutions/SAUs/CAUs/KVKs and other public sector organizations.

     * 	To organize atleast one organic cluster demonstration in a village and each institution shall conduct 03 model organic cluster demonstration in surrounding villages.

21Page

2. ## **Area of operation:**

* Organic cluster demonstrations shall be conducted in villages at farmers' field under scheme guidelines.  
* Maximum 03Model organic cluster demonstrations shall be allocated to ea.ch organization

  with a minimum of one cluster in one village in one year.

  3. ## **Implementing Agency(IA):**

The organic cluster demonstration shall be organized/conducted/implemented under the active supervision of experts/scientists/subject matter specialists(SMS) of Indian Council of Agricultural Research(ICAR) Institutions, State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), Central Agricultural Universities (CAUs), Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), National Seed Corporation (NSC), Small Farmers Agri Consortium (SFAC), Farmers Producers Organizations (FPO), National Center of Organic Farming (NCOF), Regional Center of Organic Farming (RCOF),Participatory Guarantee System(PGS)-Regional Councils(RCs) registered with NITI Ayog and other Public Sector Organizations of DAC & FW. A project demonstration team will be formed by these implementing agencies (IAs) for better focus & timely implementation.

4. ## **Monitoring Agency:**

* The organic cluster demonstrations shall be monitored by the expert team of INM Division of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers' Welfare, and State Governments.

* 	The quarterly Physical & Financial Progress Reports of the Model Organic Cluster Demonstrations shall be monitored regularly by Organic farming cell of DAC & FW with the implementing agencies.

* After completion of 03 years of the scheme, impact evaluation study will be conducted by an authorized agency of the central Government.

  5. ## **Funding Pattern:**

In case of demonstration by institutions/agencies the funding pattern is 100% grant from Central Government which will require necessary approval of the competent authority. In case of Regional Councils (RCs) of National Center of Organic Farming (NCOF) registered with Niti Aayog shall also be eligible to be the implementing agencies with the condition that atleast 10% of the total project

cost shall be contributed by them.

6. ### **Fund Allocation** :

The funds for Model Organic Farms shall be provided by the INM Division of DAC & FW, *Mio* Agriculture, and Farmers' Welfare to the implementing agencies An action plan shall be prepared and submitted to INM Division of DAC & FW for financial assistance under Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana **(PKVY)** Scheme. A project monitoring committee shall appraise the proposals and recommend for implementation.

7. ### **Organic Area Selection Criteria:**

* The proposed model demonstration cluster shall be 50 acres or 20 hectare in extent and as contiguous area as possible. Of the total number of farmers in a cluster, a minimum of 65% of the farmer should belong to small & marginal categories. Thus minimum criteria of inclusion should as far as practicable be fulfilled at cluster level and where not possible, it should be satisfied at Mandal/Block/Taluka or District level.

* 	The ceiling of subsidy that a member farmer is eligible shall be a maximum of one hectare and the total financial assistance eligible for a 50 acre or 20 hectare cluster shall be a maximum of Rs. l0(Ten) lakh for farmer members and Rs. 4.95 lakh for mobilization and Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) Certification.
