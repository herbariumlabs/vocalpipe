NRI is one of the leading global indices on the application and impact of information and communication technology (ICT) in 133 economies around the world.

2. ## **ANUSANDHAN NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION**

ANRF (Anusandhan National Research Foundation) has been established by ANRF act 2023\. The provisions of the ANRF Act, 2023 came into force on 5th February, 2024\. ANRF represents India’s pioneering efforts to unleash Indian research and innovation talent to achieve global scientific and technological excellence.

The first meeting of the Executive Council of ANRF was held under the Chairmanship of Prof. Ajay K. Sood, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India on August 22, 2024\. Afterwards, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi chaired the first meeting of the Governing Board of Anusandhan National Research Foundation on 10th September, 2024\. The meeting focussed on discussion about India’s Science and Technology landscape and redesigning of research and development programmes.

Below are the recent initiatives taken under ANRF:

ANRF has initiated Prime Minister's Early Career Research Grant (PM ECRG) program to assist young researchers to start their research career in a S\&T institution. By supporting early-career scientists, the PMECRG will play a pivotal role in advancing scientific research, enabling recipients to undertake independent and impactful research. Provisions has been made to use with a flexible budget and progressive initiatives for ease of doing research.  
ANRF has launched EV-Mission program under Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas. The objective of the EV-Mission is to promote research & development of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption in India, fostering an ecosystem that enables self-reliance and global competitiveness.

A new program Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) has been launched in form of Hub and Spoke model. The motivation of this program is to go beyond empowering researchers of higher education institutions through individual-centric research grants, to a more holistic approach of uplifting the research culture and excellence of the entire institution in a systematic manner.  
ANRF in its endeavour to facilitate equal participation of researchers from all sectors of society, has

initiated the scheme Inclusivity Research Grant (IRG). IRG scheme will provide funding support to researchers belonging to the Scheduled Caste /Scheduled Tribe to undertake research in frontier areas of science and engineering. It aims to provide a platform for researchers to further their capacity and move on to mainstream research programs.
