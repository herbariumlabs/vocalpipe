**PREFACE**

The Government of India (GoI) spends close to Rs. 14 lakh crores annually on development

activities, through nearly 750 schemes implemented by Union Ministries. To improve the

effectiveness and efficiency of public finance, and the quality of service-delivery to citizens, all

schemes have been mandated to undergo third party evaluations, to provide an evidentiary

foundation for scheme continuation from 2021-22 to 2025-26. In 2019, the Development

Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO), NITI Aayog was assigned the task of evaluating 28

Umbrella Centrally Sponsored Schemes (UCSS), which are schemes/programmes funded jointly

by the Centre and the States and implemented by the States. This historic exercise, undertaken

between April 2019 and February 2021, evaluated 125 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS),

under 10 Sectors, together covering close to 30% of the GoI’s development expenditure,

amounting to approximately Rs. 3 lakh crore (USD 43 billion) per annum.

In order to fulfil this mandate to the highest standard possible, to optimize both the robustness

and the uptake of the evidence generated, DMEO adopted a nationally representative mixed

methods evaluation methodology and a consultative review process for the reports. Through

qualitative and quantitative analysis of secondary literature, analysis was done at three levels:

the sector, the umbrella CSS and the scheme itself. The studies thus produced then underwent a

review process involving consultations with NITI Aayog subject matter divisions, concerned

Ministries and Departments, and external experts.

The present report is an outcome of this evaluation study and presents an analysis of the

Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Sector based on primary and secondary data

collection. In this Report, we seek to cover the agriculture and allied sector in India, identifying

the intended and actual contribution of GoI schemes to sector outcomes. This includes areas for

more focused effort to achieve national priorities/SDGs.

We hope that this Report will further our understanding of the Agriculture, Animal Husbandry

and Fisheries Sector and help us move towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and

the National Development Agenda, to promote the well-being of all sovereign citizens of India.

**Acknowledgements**

We would like to express our gratitude to Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman NITI Aayog, and Shri  
Amitabh Kant, Chief Executive Officer, who have been the driving force, first in entrusting this  
important responsibility to the Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO) and  
subsequently as mentors throughout the study, in providing all necessary support and guidance  
for the completion of the project. We also express our gratitude to the Ministry of Finance for  
recognizing the crucial need for evidence in the deliberations and decisions pertaining scheme  
budget allocations.

Our invaluable partners in this exercise have been the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Wlfare  
and Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying with all its officials, without whose  
cooperation this evaluation would not have been possible. We are grateful to them for providing

Chapter 1: Sector Level Analysis: Agriculture

### 1.1 Background of the Sector

Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of India’s economy, given its vast land resources  
and conducive climate. In 1960s, the share of agriculture in the Indian economy was as high as  
35%^2 which reduced over time with development in manufacturing and services sector in the  
country. In the late 1950’s and early 1960’s the country had been ridden with various issues  
including severe food deficiency. Various attempts have been made since independence to  
implement effective agricultural policies to improve the production level in agriculture and thus  
supporting both producers and consumers. Post-independence, the focus of agricultural policy  
was on ensuring food security to battle with crisis like shortage of food and extremely low yield  
rates. Between 1960 and 1970, the widespread adoption of rice and wheat was promoted along  
with an array of supportive initiatives around production subsidies, minimum support prices,  
public procurement, storage and distribution of foodgrains and trade protection. This had a long  
standing impact on the overall improvement in the yield rates and helped the nation achieve self-  
sufficiency in food grains. As a result of the Green Revolution in 1960s, the growth rate in  
agriculture started improving. The growth in agriculture was recorded as 0.7% in the period  
1960 - 69 which improved gradually over the following decades to achieve a growth of 3.88% in  
the period of 2004- 173. Soon after the green revolution, several production-centric initiatives  
were taken to support land reclamation and harvesting of ground water, development at animal  
husbandry & fishery sector and give impetus on research and training. A comprehensive National  
Agricultural Policy was drafted in 2000 with an endeavor to bring large scale sectoral  
development. Progress on the parameters set by the policies led to further growth in the  
agriculture and allied sectors.

This section on sector analysis of agriculture covers background on production trends,  
contribution of the sector to Gross Value Added (GVA), key growth drivers, exports, and  
employment share. It further captures sector performance in terms of production and  
productivity, land use patterns, irrigation, storage and processing infrastructure, post-harvest  
infrastructure, price-realization by farmers, export trends and social considerations. At the end,  
an analysis of major centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) is detailed out, covering the scheme  
objectives, components, and Deloitte’s assessment of the impact of these schemes on beneficiary  
groups, infrastructure creation/ upgradation, and capacity building, etc. wherever available. A  
summary of agriculture sector’s key challenges and strengths along with the most impactful  
schemes has been given at the end of this section. A number of previous studies, evaluation  
reports, and annual reports were reviewed through the course of the study, including those from  
UN Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO), Report on Doubling Farmers’ Income, Economic  
Survey, Ministry-level reports, Departmental Annual Reports, other independent evaluation  
reports and analysis, among others.

The yield for a majority of crops in India is still lower than the world average. Low irrigation  
levels, use of sub-par quality seeds, low adoption of technology, and limited knowledge about  
improved agricultural practices. Another oft-discussed issue is maintaining food security in the  
midst of low productivity and higher migration of agricultural workers into cities for better  
incomes, particularly small and marginal farmers. Infrastructure availability for perishable food  
items is another concern that calls for attention.

The overarching objective of the sector is maintaining food security while also ensuring  
remunerative prices to farmers. The goal is to modernize agriculture technology to ensure  
increase in productivity, efficiency, and crop diversification. Closing the information gap  
regarding best irrigation practices (given the region’s topography), latest technologies, and  
improved agricultural practices through extension services is required for enhancing production  
and productivity. This may be done through Kisan Melas, demonstrations, exposure visits, Krishi  
Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), and Farmer Friends, or through Gram Panchayats. The government must  
also seek to transform the rural economy through the creation of modern rural infrastructure and  
an integrated value chain system. This shall also incorporate promotion of value-added products,  
enable diversification to high value crops, and boost country’s exports. All this would call for a  
policy environment that enables income security for farmers, whilst maintaining India’s food  
security so that farmers are willing to experiment with diversified crops/cropping patterns.  
Further, more agripreneurs must be encouraged so that even small and marginal farmers can  
capture a higher share of value addition from ‘farmgate to fork’. Private sector participation must  
be encouraged in agricultural development to ensure better remuneration and  
marketing/distribution of products. Promotion of Research & Development, better marketing  
infrastructure, and natural farming shall further contribute to sectoral development. Lastly,  
boosting agriculture credit is critical for the sector and thus is one of the key objectives for the  
sector.

A representative illustrative of the sector’s vision is given below:

Agriculture Sector Assessment

Agriculture is one of the largest contributors to the economy in India with agriculture, fishing and  
forestry having 13. 18 % share in the GDP of the country as of 20 18 - 194. Agriculture is the primary  
source of livelihood for over 58% of households in rural area. Endowed with 15 agro-climatic  
zones, ~400 million acres of arable area and 46 to 60 types of soil types, the country has abundant  
agricultural produce across the year. In order to address food security concerns, India focused on  
maximizing production in agriculture and is currently a net exporter of agriculture with the global  
rank of 8^5. India is the largest producer of spices, pulses, milk, tea, cashew, mango, banana and  
jute, and the second-largest producer of wheat, rice, fruits and vegetables, sugarcane, cotton and  
oilseeds. The overall growth registered in the agriculture sector in terms of percentage increase  
year on year has been depicted below.

According to the 4th advance estimates of 2017- 186 , India produces more than one billion tons of  
agricultural produce. Advance estimates for 2017 - 18 indicate that food grains output reached  
28 4.83 million tonnes with pulses at a record 25.23 million tonnes and cereals (rice, wheat, maize,  
millets, etc.) at 259.60 million tonnes. Oilseeds production is estimated at 31.31 million tonnes in  
2017 - 1 8 and in horticulture the production has reached 311 million tonnes. Sugarcane, cotton,  
jute, tea, coffee, tobacco, etc. adds more than 400 million tonnes to the agricultural production of  
the country.

As a result of near normal rainfall during monsoon in 2017 and various policy initiatives  
undertaken by the Government, country witnessed record food grain production in 2017-18. As  
per 4th Advance Estimates for 2017-18, total food grain production in the country is estimated at  
284.83 million tonnes which is higher by 9.72 million tonnes than the previous record production  
of food grain of 275.11 million tonnes achieved during 2016-17. The production during 2017- 18  
is also higher by 24.66 million tonnes than the previous five years’ (2012-13 to 2016-17) average  
production of food grain.

agriculture, forestry & fishing sector in GVA is shown the graph below. There has been a steady  
decrease in the share of Agri-Allied GVA from the year 2011-12 to 2017-18. The agriculture and  
allied sector comprises of crops, livestock, forestry & logging, and fishing & aquaculture and their  
respective share in the total GVA over the last 6 years has been given in the following table. As  
discussed in the Economic Survey 2018-19, the decline in share of Agriculture and allied sector is  
attributed to the continuous decline in contribution of crops over the given period.

Contribution to Employment

As the Indian economy has diversified and grown, agriculture's contribution to GDP has steadily  
declined from 1951 to 2018, yet it is still the country's largest employment source and a  
significant piece of its overall socio-economic development.

Total share of employment in Agriculture in India has shown a gradual decline from 51.1% in  
2010 to 43.2% in 2019 as per latest data estimates from World Bank.

This has been in-line with the declining trend across the world level aggregate data (decline from  
33.21 per cent in 2010 to 28.1 per cent in 2019). The declining trend has been largely because of

Key Drivers for Growth in the Sector

The performance of agriculture, especially growth in the sector, is dependent on a host of factors.  
The key drivers for growth in the agricultural sector in India can be clustered into the following  
categories –

*   **Growing population and growth in income** : Growth in agriculture sector is chiefly driven  
    by domestic demand. Population growth in India and the rising disposable incomes aligned  
    with increasing awareness of healthy eating is expected to keep the demand for sustainably-  
    sourced agricultural products high. According to the analysis drawn in the report Demand &  
    Supply Projections Towards 2033: Crops, Livestock, Fisheries and Agricultural by NITI Aayog  
    Working Group^13 , demand for agricultural produce is expected to increase with the  
    population and the estimates for FY 2029 - 30 have been provided as below.

    However apart from increase in population, the demand is also driven by socio-economic
    factors that is expected to result in shift in consumption patterns. As per the analysis
    provided above, the estimated demand for fruits, vegetables and oilseeds would be the
    highest. This would imply a shift in usage of land towards high value crops.
    

*   **Increase in access to farm inputs** : Agricultural productivity depends on availability of farm  
    inputs such as high quality seeds, fertilizers, and amenities of farm mechanization. Substantial  
    agricultural surplus can be produced through modernization of farming practices which  
    would employ improved farm inputs including high level of farm mechanization. Currently  
    farm mechanization in India is as low as 40%-45% with an available farm power of 2.02  
    kW/Ha (2016- 17 )^14 ; the current national level of farm mechanization is much lower in  
    comparison to BRIC countries like China and Brazil^15. With use of modern farm equipment,

    the farm productivity is estimated to increase by up to 30% and reduce the input cost by
    20%^16.
    

*   **Access to credit** : Access to farm credit is an important factor leading to a stable farm produce.  
    Farm loans for investment purposes are available for irrigation, agricultural mechanization,  
    land development, plantation, horticulture and post-harvest management. The central Indian  
    government supports Indian farmers through credit facilities and MSP mechanisms available  
    for various crops. In FY2018, bank credits to agriculture and allied industries represented  
    about 40% of the country’s total “priority sector” credit. Currently schemes like Interest  
    Subvention scheme for institutional credit and PMFBY (Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana)  
    for crop insurance is being implemented to support small and marginal farmers financially  
    and ensure consistent production each year.
*   **Post production infrastructure and logistic facilities:** Presence and easy access to market  
    the agricultural produce is a critical driver of growth for agriculture. Product-wise organized  
    primary market channels enable farmers to monetize their farm output. The infrastructure  
    required to market the farm produce is availed through the following market avenues:  
    − Near farm mandis – (for primary assembly and wholesale transaction)  
    − Near farm farmers market – retail transactions  
    − Wholesale markets –local, national, APMC (food grains) including eNAM  
    − Central and State government procurement (food grains)  
    − Private procurement  
    Post-production infrastructure in agriculture includes setting up of improved warehouses,  
    regulated market yards and cold storages. As of 2017, the total warehouse capacity in India  
    is assessed to be 77.63 million tonnes and an estimated 34 million tonnes of storage capacity  
    in cold storages has been created.
*   **Skilled Human Resource:** In India around 85% of farmers are small and marginal with  
    fragmented land holdings and practicing primitive subsistence farming. While the  
    productivity of farm depends on the use of inputs like fertilizer, access to irrigation,  
    technology, crop intensity and choice of crops (crop pattern) grown at the farm, the farmer’s  
    access to the knowledge is critical to ensure a consistent production every year. In an  
    endeavor to improve the agricultural production and the farmer’s knowhow, agricultural  
    extension is provided to provide research based knowledge for capacity building of farmers  
    and improve their income. Agricultural Technology Management Agency offers extension  
    services to farmers by disbursing information, knowledge and skills through awareness  
    generation, demonstration and thus empowering the farmers and ensuring a self-reliant  
    farming system in the country.

### 1.2 Performance of the Sector

Production of important agriculture products^17

The agriculture sector consists of food grains, oilseeds, horticulture crops among other crops like  
plantation crops etc. The trend of production of food grains, oilseeds and horticulture crops from  
2011 - 12 to 2017-18, along with their growth rate over the years has been presented in the graphs  
below.

**(1) Food grains**

India is the second largest producer of food grains globally and third largest producer of cereals  
in the world. The basket of cereals includes rice, wheat, maize, and a wide variety of millets or  
nutri- cereals. However, speciality rice like basmati have made a mark in the global market. The  
food grains production has increased at a CAGR of 1.35% between 2011 and 2018, with the  
growth rate being volatile over the past years.

**(2) Oilseeds**

India is one of the major oilseeds grower and importer of edible oils. India’s vegetable oil economy  
is the world’s fourth largest after USA, China & Brazil.

The basket of oilseeds in India comprises of 9 oilseeds which include 7 edible oilseeds  
(groundnut, rapeseed & mustard, soybean, sunflower, sesame, safflower and niger) and two non-  
edible oilseeds (castor and linseed). Oilseeds cultivation is undertaken across the country in  
about 27 million hectares mainly on marginal lands, of which 72% is confined to rainfed farming.  
India is yet to reach self-sufficiency in the production of oilseeds with per capita availability of  
vegetable oil at the rate of 19.5 kg/year/person^18 and has to depend on import of palm oil from  
Indonesia and Malaysia. Under the scheme, National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm, strategies  
have been taken to increase production and productivity of oilseeds, palm oil, and other  
treeborne oilseeds like sal, mahua, simarouba, kokum, olive, karanja, jatropha, neem, jojoba,  
cheura, wild apricot, walnut, tung etc. The production of oilseeds has been fluctuating over the  
given period and grown at a CAGR of 0.71% between 2011 and 2018 as presented in the graph  
below.

**(3) Horticulture Crops**

Horticulture comprises a wide array of cultivation systems and is classified in 6 broad categories  
namely, pomology (fruits), olericulture (vegetables), floriculture (flowers), plantation crops,  
spices, aromatics and herbal medicines. Horticulture is considered as the sunrise sector in  
agriculture given its higher monetisable potential relative to field crops like cereals, pulses and  
oilseeds. Horticulture contributes more than a third of the agricultural GDP, though it occupies  
less than a fifth of the cultivated area and is expected to increase further fuelled by high demand  
for fresh fruits and vegetables.

Significant progress has been made in area expansion under horticulture resulting in higher  
production. Over the last decade, the area under horticulture grew by about 2.6% per annum and  
annual production increased by 4.8%^19. The production of vegetables has increased from 101.2  
million tonnes to 184.40 million tonnes since 2004-05 to 2017-18 and 50.9 million tonnes to  
97.35 million tonnes since 2004-05 to 2017-18. The growth in horticulture production has been  
comparatively consistent over the last few years compared to growth in production of food grains  
and oilseeds. Horticulture production has grown at a CAGR of 2.78% between 2011 and 2018.

Horticulture crops production in India has increased from 257.27 million tonnes in 2011-12 to  
311.71 million tonnes in 2017-18. Within India, the states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and  
Madhya Pradesh were the top horticulture crops producer states in 2017-18. These three states  
accounted for more than 30% of total horticulture crops production in India. Among the top  
producer states, Uttar Pradesh accounted for 13% of total production in 2017-18, followed by  
West Bengal accounting for about 10% of the total production.

**Landholding of Farmers**

The number of operational holdings, i.e. land put to agricultural use, has increased from 13.8  
crores in 2010-11 to 14.6 crores in 2015-16 as per the Agriculture Census 2015-16.

The share of marginal holdings (less than 1 hectare) in total operational holdings increased from  
62.9% in 2000-01 to 68.5% in 2015-16, while the share of small holdings (1 ha to 2 ha) decreased  
from 18.9% to 17.7% during this period. Large holdings (above 4 ha) decreased from 6.5% to  
4.3%.

Survey 2018-19, Agriculture Chapter

The area operated by the marginal and small farmers increased from 38.9% in 2000-01 to 47.4%  
in 2015-16, while large holdings decreased from 37.2% to 20% during this period.

Irrigation

India has improved its performance in bringing agricultural land under irrigation in the last  
decade. The gross irrigated area in the country increased by 13% between 2006-07 and 201 4 - 15  
and irrigation intensity expressed as the ratio of gross irrigated area (GIA) to gross cropped area  
(GCA), increased by 9% as reported in the report Doubling Farmers’ Income – Volume I.

    29
    

Between 2006-07 and 2014-15, area brought under irrigation in Madhya Pradesh alone was 3.5  
million hectares, followed by Rajasthan (2.2 million ha), and Uttar Pradesh (1.5 million ha). A total  
of 10788 hectares of gross cropped area has been brought under irrigation. Out of a total of  
197852 thousand hectares (as of 2014-15), a total of 94825 thousand hectares is gross irrigated  
area. The top 10 states with the highest percentage of gross cropped area under irrigation are  
featured in the graph below.

**Micro Irrigation**

In an attempt to improve production efficiency in agriculture and enhance the output, strategies  
for implementing Micro Irrigation have been taken in India. Micro Irrigation enhances water use  
efficiency through appropriate technological interventions like drip & sprinkler irrigation  
systems and encourage the farmers to use water saving and conservation technologies.

As per estimates of micro irrigation data, out of the total potential area of 42.24 million hectares,  
only 18% is under micro-irrigation. The area under drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation for the  
top 10 states has been shown in the graph below.

Centrally Sponsored Schemes for Micro Irrigation, National Mission on Micro-Irrigation is being  
implemented to increase water use efficiency and crop productivity especially in states with low  
rainfall. Under this scheme, the reduction in resource cost and productivity enhancement has  
been assessed state-wise. The irrigation cost reduced by 20-50 per cent with an average of 32.3  
per cent. Saving of fertilizers with average reduction of about 28 per cent in total fertilizer  
consumption was reported in the surveyed states along with 30% energy consumption savings.  
Gains in productivity registered an increase in average productivity of fruits and vegetables by  
42.3%.

After adoption of micro irrigation systems, the states of Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat are  
enjoying both high energy consumption savings as well as fertiliser consumption savings.^21

Infrastructure

Agriculture production in India is focused on incremental growth and providing input for further  
growth in food and beverage manufacturing industry in the country. Being one of the largest  
global agricultural producer, India has potential to improve its food processing industry with  
substantial agriculture surplus production, storage and cold chain infrastructure, modernized  
post-harvest facilities and government support. India’s food and beverage industry was the fifth-  
largest sector in manufacturing, and the leader in terms of employment generation in FY2017.  
The sector is expected to attract private investment post the approval of 100% FDI in food trading  
for food manufactured in India.

There is need to strengthen and add to the existing post-harvest infrastructural facilities, primary  
processing units, cold storages and distribution facilities. Hence the strategies undertaken to  
improve agricultural trade includes infrastructure creation, enhanced access to marketing  
information and reduced food loss.

**Warehousing and Cold Storages**

Warehousing and cold storages are the primary post-production infrastructure for holding  
surplus stock for extended duration. Under the Warehousing Development & Regulatory  
Authority (WDRA), warehouses managed by Food Corporation of India (FCI), Central  
Warehousing Corporation, State Marketing Federations, State Civil Supplies Corporation are  
registered. In 2018- 19 , a total storage capacity of 162.71 million tonnes was available for food  
grains including cereals and pulses.

Procurement of food grains for the Central Pool is done through Food Corporation of India and  
State agencies through Minimum Support Price as declared in the given year by Government of  
India. The stock position of food grains under Central Pool as of 2016-17 was 380.04 lakh MT  
which included rice (297.84 lakh MT), wheat (80.59 lakh MT), pulse (1.47 lakh MT) and coarse  
grains (1.61 lakh MT).

Cold chain infrastructure is one of the most critical component for handling the agricultural  
produce, especially the perishable goods to store and connect to the market. Cold-chain ensures  
that fresh whole produce reaches gainful end-use and thus reduces food loss. Cold chain  
infrastructure is a logistic chain that includes cold storages or refrigerated warehousing  
integrated with refrigerated transportation. India lacks adequate transportation facilities in the  
cold chain infrastructure with only 12% of the total refrigerated capacity in transport  
infrastructures. 88% of the cold storage capacities are stand-alone infrastructures. An estimated  
34 million tonnes of storage capacity in cold storages (as of March 2017) has been created, but  
with allied development of only about 11,000 refrigerated transport units having a capacity of 4  
million tonnes only. The transport units are exclusively as trucks, as there are no multi-modal  
reefer containers for domestic use (rail shipment) of temperature sensitive fresh produce or  
processed products.

The gap in the cold chain infrastructure in India had been assessed in All India Cold-chain  
Infrastructure Capacity study by National Centre for Cold-chain Development (NCCD) conducted  
in 2015. The infrastructural gap found in the study is as follows:

Currently there are 7,645 cold storage units in India with a total capacity of 34.95 million tonnes  
as estimated in 2016-17.^22 The distribution of cold storages is highly uneven with majority of the  
cold storages located in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana,  
Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. 85% of the cold storage capacity is concentrated in these 8 states. The  
top states with the highest capacities of cold storage facilities have been depicted in the following

As observed in the household survey, agricultural farmers have been accessing various  
infrastructure for procurement of seeds, primary and secondary level processing, transportation  
and others. The graph below depicts the access of various agricultural infrastructure by farmers.

**Food Losses or Post-harvest losses**

Food losses or post-harvest losses are primarily caused by failure in the handling and connecting  
of food produced to consumption points or markets. The food loss that post-harvest and before  
connecting to markets, is effectively a loss of saleable volume and value, and is an economic  
burden on the food supply system. In addition, the perishable agricultural products which are  
high nutritious food and high value crops are more susceptible to the loss. The post-harvest losses  
in India had been evaluated in 2015 by a study^24 commissioned by MoFPI to CIPHET. As per their  
estimates, the total food loss in agricultural products which include food grains, fruits and  
vegetables ranges between 3.08% and 15.88%. The agricultural commodity wise post-harvest  
losses estimated in India are depicted in the table below.

Moreover, analysis of food loss conducted by SFAC in North Eastern states shows that the food  
loss is in the range of 9% (potato) to 32% (peas)^25 , implying states with poor connectivity and  
infrastructure are even more vulnerable to post harvest losses. In another study done in 2015 by  
NCCD, losses in horticulture produce had been estimated across activities from farm to whole-  
sale markets located mostly in North India. The findings reveal the range of post-harvest losses  
varies from 7% (watermelon) to 44% (pears). The losses in the agricultural produce were  
assessed across its journey from the farm to the market. The stages of measurement of the loss  
were:

    − At farm-gate (point of harvest)
    − At collection point (aggregation)
    − On loading onto transport
    − During transportation
    − On receiving at wholesale point
    

According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the global food loss  
and waste^26 incurred amounts to 1.3 billion tonnes (2011)^27. Fruits and vegetables have the  
highest food loss and waste of 44%, followed by roots and tubers (20%) and cereals (19%).

According to the FAO report, HLPE, 2014, food losses and waste in the context of sustainable food  
systems, in South and South East Asia 28% of the agricultural produce is lost or wasted, out of  
which 21% is attributed to losses during harvest, post-harvest and processing. The reduction of  
the crop losses can be ensured by improving the market linkage which includes logistics,  
transportation, warehousing facilities and cold storages. As per the Economic Survey 2018-19,  
India’s global position in food loss is 70^28 with a score of 86.4 as against the average global score  
of 84.9.

Price Realization

**Price realization by farmers**

As assessed by the Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Household, NSSO, 2015, the share  
of a producer in each rupee paid by the consumer is found to be as lowest in the case of fruits and  
vegetables^29. The price realization of farmers across various key commodities have been assessed  
in the report and compared with price realization of different agencies such as the mandi, input  
dealers, cooperatives and government agencies, processors in an endeavor to improve farmers’  
share in consumer price. The table below gives the price realization by farmers in kharif and rabi  
crops of 2012-13.

farmers, expressed as share in consumer rupee across a wider variety of commodities reveal that  
pulses and fruits & vegetables have the lowest realization. While farmers share in pulses range  
between 46-56%, for most fruits (aonla, apple, kinnow, litchi, mango, banana, pineapple,

    pomegranate, sapota, sweet orange), it is as low as 26% to 67%. Among all fruits, banana is most
    profitable to trade as its price realization range between 82% - 85% in most of the markets.
    Efficient marketing system is ensured by operational ease and price efficiencies in the market
    channels of various agricultural produce. Reducing farm gate price dispersion through creation
    of improved physical infrastructure have enabled better monetization of farm produce by
    farmers. The extent of price dispersion at farm gate, across multiple markets in the country is
    thus considered as a measure for marketing efficiency.
    According to the NSSO Situation Assessment Survey of Agriculture Households Round 70, price
    dispersion for specific crops had been studied across states on the basis of 2013 prices. The table
    below quantifies the price wedges between farm-gate prices to the final consumer prices in which
    the biggest price wedges are for
    potatoes, onions and
    groundnuts. The wedges are
    lower for rice, wheat for which
    there are a large number of
    farmers and is supported by
    Minimum Support Price. The
    price wedges for pulses is in the
    mid-range. As analyzed in the
    Economic Survey 2015 - 16,
    perishability of agricultural
    products was inferred as an
    important factor driving price
    wedges.
    Comparison of India’s price
    dispersion (ratio highest to
    lowest crop price) in key
    agricultural commodities have
    been done with price dispersion
    in USA for 2012. While India’s
    price dispersion ranged from 1.6
    (Tur) to 5.5 (groundnut), price
    dispersion in USA ranged from 0-1.7 for its key agricultural commodities for the same year^30.
    Change in Agricultural Prices
    As observed in the household (HH) survey, the price of paddy (per kg) and wheat (per kg) has
    increased by 19.6 9 % and 17.8 1 % between 2015-16 and 2018- 19 respectively as realized by
    farmers. The price of paddy and wheat as of 2015- 1 6 is the base price considered for the analysis.
    The observation has been depicted in the graph below.

**Change in Income of Producers**

The average annual income of agricultural household comes from components like cultivation,  
livestock, non-farm business, and wages and salaries. The average income of agricultural  
households is estimated with representations from marginal and small (owning land size of less  
than 2 hectares), medium and semi-medium (owning land size in the range of 2 to 10 hectares)  
and large farmers (owning land size of more than 10 hectares) according to the sizes of the  
landholdings owned by them. The income for the small and marginal farmers is comprised of a  
larger share of wages and salaries while for large farmers, a major share of the income comes  
from cultivation.

The average income of agricultural household has been estimated over the recent years through  
surveys. In 2012-13, a Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households had been  
conducted through the NSSO 70th Round, which estimated the average annual income to be Rs  
77,976. In 2016-17, NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey 2016- 17 was further  
conducted which revealed about 40% higher income levels in agriculture households during a  
three year period ending 2015-16 as compared with the estimates by NSSO Situation Assessment  
Survey, 70th round for the year 2012-13.

### Discussion on cross-sectional thematic areas

    i. Accountability and Transparency
    

The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is apex institution for  
providing assistance to all activities around agriculture, livestock and fisheries with its  
constituent Departments of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare assisting in agriculture  
related activities. The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare coordinates  
with the State Governments assisting them with the continuous progress in agricultural  
production across the country. The Directorate of Economics & Statistics, an attached office of  
DAC&FW is responsible for providing important statistics on area, production, cost and yield of  
principal crops, minimum support prices, to implement schemes related to improvement of  
agricultural statistics, and carrying out agro-economic research. The production of major crops  
in the country are released in 4 Advanced Estimates followed by Final Estimates available State-  
wise and at the national level for the 28 identified crops including pulses.

In agriculture sector, 15 schemes are identified for DBT implementation, out of which around 10  
centrally sponsored schemes are linked to the DBT portal to ensure transparent delivery of  
financial assistance to beneficiaries including individual farmers, entrepreneurs, and State  
Governments. The Management Information System of these schemes is linked with Central  
Agriculture Portal (dbtdacfw.gov.in).

The details of the scheme-wise DBT fund transfers in 2018-19 are given in the table below:

    ii. Direct/indirect employment generation
    

Shortage of agricultural labour in the sector has emerged as one of major challenge for the  
agriculture sector. The workforce engaged in agriculture sector was pegged at 228.3 million in  
2011 - 12 out of a total workforce in the country of 467 million, having the highest share of workers  
in the country^34. However, the trend of workers engaged in agriculture has been decreasing over  
the years not just as a share in total employment but also in absolute numbers employed in the  
sector.

(^34) FICCI, KPMG. 2015. Labour in Indian Agriculture: A Growing Challenge.

    46
    

Figure 65 : Trend of Workers Share in Agriculture Sector in India

The trend of declining workers share in agriculture depicts the growing problem of agriculture  
labour shortage with fewer people being added to the sector and many of the workers migrating  
to other remunerative sectors. It has been observed that around 2 million people were added to  
the workforce since 2004-05 compared to around 12 million people that were added to the  
workforce every year as an average between 1999-00 and 2004-05.

A state-wise analysis of agriculture labour productivity suggests that around 80% of the  
reduction in agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 is attributed to the reduction in  
agriculture workers in five states, namely Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Bihar and  
Rajasthan.

The graph shown above depicts that most of the agrarian states in the country experienced the  
drop in agriculture labour force during 2004-05 to 2011-12, with Uttar Pradesh having the  
maximum decline by 28% followed by states like Karnataka (15%), West Bengal (12%), Bihar  
(12%) and Rajasthan (12%). Some of the top reasons causing labour attrition is because

agriculture is less profitable than other occupations available in the secondary and tertiary  
sectors and there is preference for a permanent/ regular job compared to agriculture which is a  
seasonal occupation. The shift in rural employment under the primary sector has decreased from  
71% and 64% while the employment in secondary sector gained from 15% to 20% between the  
period 2004-05 and 2011- 1235.

Certain crops production which requires significant amount of labour hours per unit of area  
cultivated are also affected by scarcity of labour. Crops such as paddy, wheat, cotton sugarcane  
and groundnut are among the most likely to be affected by labour scarcity. As per the analysis of  
the FICCI-KPMG Study on Labour in Indian Agriculture, the states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra,  
Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal have substantial coverage under the  
labour intensive crops and consequently have higher propensity to face labour challenges in the  
near future.

In 2012-13, the number of agricultural households in India was pegged at 90.2 million which  
constituted around 57.8% of the total estimated rural households of the country.^36

Figure 671 : State-wise distribution of Agricultural Households

Among the major States, Rajasthan had highest percentage of agricultural households (78.4%)  
among its rural households followed by Uttar Pradesh (74.8%) and Madhya Pradesh (70.8 %).

The principal source of income for the agricultural households has also been analysed and it  
reveals that agricultural households mainly depend on cultivation followed by wage/ salaried  
employment. The figure below shows the various sources of principal income for the agricultural  
households in the country as of 2012-13.

Out of all agriculture based employment, cultivation has the highest share, with 63% of  
agriculture households depending on cultivation for their principal income generation and 4% of  
the agricultural households depending on livestock rearing for the same. When the classification  
of agricultural household’s principal income generation is assessed according to their  
landholdings, it is found that households with larger landholdings are likely to be more dependent  
on cultivation.

The table above shows the share of agricultural households’ dependency on cultivation across  
different landholdings. The households with very low land holdings, i.e. less than 0.04 hectare  
have lesser dependency on cultivation and their principal source of income comes from

    iii. Gender Mainstreaming
    

Agriculture provides employment to the adult males as well as the adult females of a household.  
Women have a critical role in cultivation and have been engaged in production of major grains  
and millets, in land preparation, seed selection and seedling production, sowing, applying  
manure, weeding, transplanting, threshing, winnowing and harvesting.

Globally, the rate of participation of women in agriculture has been pegged at 42% as of 2010,  
where as in India over 60% of women are engaged in agriculture^37. The overall worker  
participation rate amongst women in India is only 25.5%, whereas the same among men is 53.9%  
(refer table given alongside). There has been no improvement in the worker participation rate  
amongst women between 2001 and 2011. In agriculture sector, share of women cultivators  
amongst total cultivators have decreased from 32.3% (2001) to 30.3% (2011). Women  
agricultural labourers have also decreased from 46.6% (2001) to 42.7% (2011) as seen from the  
table above. It is also observed that the share of women in total agricultural workers which  
continuously increased during last 50 years to 39% in 2001 declined to about 37% in 2011^38.  
With the trend of agriculture accommodating lesser number of women workers in the future, it  
is important to take up suitable technological and policy initiatives for increasing the involvement  
of the women workers in agriculture.

Female in the agriculture group represents a crucial demographic group. Rural women form the  
most productive work force in the economy for a majority of the nations, including India. Women  
in rural families can be considered as ‘farmers’ in some sense, working as agricultural labourers,  
unpaid workers in the family farm enterprises or combination of the two^39. Women are mostly  
engaged in labour intensive work such as seed preparation for sowing, raising nurseries for  
seedlings, thinning, sowing, transplanting, weeding, preparation of fertilizers as well as  
application of fertilizer, in gap filling, winnowing, grading, shifting produce to threshing floor,  
cleaning and processing the grain etc. As of 2019, 56.5% of women vis-à-vis 39.5% men are  
engaged in agriculture, as highlighted in the figure below.

Women play an important role in agriculture during crop production, post-harvest operations,  
etc. The share of operational holdings cultivated by women has increased to 13.9% in 2015- 16  
from 11.7% in 2005-06.

The above indicates an increased participation of women in the management and operation of  
agricultural lands.

The growing inequity among the women engaged in agriculture is riddled with various issues.  
The problems faced by the women at the farm are^40 :

*   Lack of Extension Services: Extension services seem to be biased towards men who are  
    recognized as the owner of farms and pass on the extension information to women in the  
    households. This often results in depriving women who are engaged as agricultural  
    workers from obtaining key knowledge of improved farming practices.
*   Land Ownership: Lack of ownership of land/ access to land for women continues to be  
    major obstacle to increasing their contribution and benefits.
*   Overburden: Women are often involved in labour intensive, monotonous, repetitive and  
    drudgery prone work, which are carried out manually, leading to mental and physical  
    exhaustion and occupational health hazards.

*   Limited Access to Resources: Having no direct ownership of land, women face constraint  
    of money and other resources required for cultivation. Women have limited access to  
    markets as well. The current transport and marketing facilities also are not inclusive of  
    the needs of the women farmers and traders.
*   Migration of Men: Migration of spouses to cities to earn a living have led to increase in  
    responsibilities for women in the rural agricultural households.
*   Socio-Economic Status: It is observed that women’s share of work in agriculture is  
    greatest among small farmers. Women in landless households spend twice as much time  
    working for wages in agriculture than women in families with land.
*   Lack of Education: Due to illiteracy, women are forced to work as unskilled labourers. One  
    of the studies showed that agricultural productivity increased with increase in primary  
    education of at least 4 years.^41

Incorporation of gender perspective in policies, plan, programmes and projects can effectively  
bring gender equity in farming. Some of the strategies that can help in mainstreaming women in  
agriculture are as follows:

*   Collation of gender based data and understand the requirement of women farmers to  
    design women friendly farm equipment
*   Sensitization of extension workers to include women farmers
*   Training should be made available to women in the use of technologies
*   Sensitizing public, private agencies, policy makers, planners on the gender perspective  
    in environmental and developmental issues
*   Planning at the local panchayat level should be gender-sensitive and should have  
    gender/sex-segregated information

As observed in the HH survey, out of all workers engaged in agricultural activities as self-  
employed or paid workers, 31 % are women. The analysis of male and female workers engaged in  
agricultural activities as self-employed workers or paid workers at farm households has been  
given in the graph below.

Box 1 : Strengthening women farmers’ role in sugarcane value chain

    Case Study: Strengthening women farmers’ role in sugarcane value chain
    Introduction:
    Globally, India is the second largest sugarcane producer, contributing to about 10% of its agricultural
    GDP (Solomon, S. 2016. Sugarcane Production and Development of Sugar Industry in India. Sugar Tech.,
    18(6)). Female employment in agriculture in 2018 stood at 55.38% (ILOSTAT database, September
    2018). According to the 2011 census, the agriculture sector employs nearly 98 million women, with
    about 63% of them serving as agricultural laborers (DownToEarth, Defeminisation of Indian agriculture,
    8 March 2018). Yet, their contribution remains undervalued – especially in sectors such as sugarcane
    farming, which are perceived to be male-dominated.
    Challenge:
    DCM Shriram Limited is one of India’s largest business conglomerates, with a strong focus on
    agribusiness in rural India. Much of its sugarcane produce comes from Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, one of the
    poorest, most patriarchal, and most disadvantaged districts in the country, with 66% of its population
    living below the poverty line. Hardoi has an agriculture-based economy, with sugarcane as the main cash
    crop.
    Although women actively participate in the sugarcane value chain, their work and contribution are often
    overlooked. Women’s work is labor-intensive and frequently concentrated at the very start of the value-
    chain, such as in weeding or planting. Sugarcane farming is often perceived to be a male-dominated
    activity--so training and programs that allow farmers to increase their yield and income are often not
    targeted at women. Male farmers typically have assets registered in their name, resulting in the exclusion
    of women farmers or farmers’ wives from accessing credit, markets, or becoming members of farmers’
    networks. Women also tend to have limited economic access both within their community and outside
    because of restrictive social norms and care responsibilities toward the well-being of elders, children,
    livestock, and other assets.
    Solution:
    Under the Meetha-Sona-Unnati program, DCM Shriram and IFC, in collaboration with Solidaridad
    Network Asia and Coca-Cola India, developed an approach to build the capacity of farmers, to increase

    agricultural yield and conserve water and soil health. DCM Shriram and IFC developed specific solutions
    to increase the visibility of the work done by women farmers and their impact on improving farm yields:
    

*   DCM Shriram and IFC identified key operations where women laborers and farmers are the  
    dominant workforce on ground. The project applied the Women’s Empowerment Agriculture  
    Index, an innovative measurement tool to diagnose areas of disempowerment of women in  
    agriculture and design development programs to address those areas. This assessment marked a  
    significant shift from earlier gender-blind analysis and enabled the project team to create targeted  
    trainings for women farmers on improving their skills and knowledge.
*   Based on the findings of the baseline on women’s roles and crop yield barriers, the project team  
    hired a female trainer to hold training sessions for women on mechanization, entrepreneurship,  
    and financial literacy. To address low participation, wider outreach and convenience, especially for  
    women farmers, the team brought in a mobile van to deliver the trainings closer to farmers’ homes.
*   This effort was further complemented by focus group discussions with women in the villages, to  
    strengthen their role and participation in the sugarcane value chain.  
    **Impact:**
*   Trainings for more than 1,000 women in the classroom and mobile vans on Good Agri Water  
    Management Practices (GAWMP) have led to an increased yield (of 25 percent) in the DCM Shriram

    iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient
    practices & diversifications
    

Climate change is a threat to agriculture productivity and could impact livelihood and income of  
farmers. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), approximately a  
quarter of all anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide are caused by agriculture, forestry and  
land use changes. Nearly 80% of poor population of the world who lives in rural areas and  
typically rely on agriculture, forestry and fisheries for their survival are affected.^42 The severity  
of climate change is likely to increase in future and there could be drop in crop yields by 10 to 25  
percent by 2050 in the face of climate change.

Effects of climate change can significantly affect major crops grown in India. A study^43 on the top  
grains grown in the country reflects that the national food supply (which is closely associated  
with grain production) is sensitive to the effect of climate variability on monsoon grain  
production. The research analysed data on yields of five major grain crops of India (finger millet,  
maize, pearl millet, sorghum and rice) over 46 years (1966-2011) and covering 593 of India’s 707  
districts. The findings revealed yields from rice, India’s main crop experienced larger declines  
during extreme weather conditions and reliance on single crop like rice for food security can  
make India’s food supply potentially more vulnerable to the effects of varying climate. On the  
other hand, yield of other crops included in the study such as millet, sorghum, and maize were  
found to be more resilient to the extreme weather. These alternative grains therefore offer  
promise for reducing variations in Indian grain production in response to climate shocks, but  
avoiding grain production shortfalls from increased alternative grains will require yield  
improvements that do not compromise their superior climate resilience. To address the issue, it  
is recommended to expand the area under the alternate grains like millet, sorghum, and maize  
during the monsoon season. This could potentially offer protection to the country’s grain supply  
which has been varying during the episodes of extreme climate such as droughts and storms.

According to estimates of ICAR studies, yields of irrigated rice is projected to decrease by about  
4% in 2020, 7% in 2050 and 10% in 2080^44. Climate change is projected to reduce timely-sown  
irrigated wheat production by about 6% in 2020. In case of late sown wheat, however, the  
projected reductions are to the extent of 18, 23 and 25 percent in 2020, 2050 and 2080  
respectively. Rainfed sorghum yields are projected to decline marginally (2.5%) in 2020 scenario  
and by about 8% in 2050.

In order to combat the impacts of climate change on agriculture, Government through Indian  
Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has initiated a network project on ‘National Initiative on  
Climate Resilient Agriculture’ (NICRA) to enhance resilience of Indian agriculture through  
Strategic Research on adaptation and mitigation (covering crops, livestock, fisheries and natural  
resource management), Technology Demonstration, Capacity Building and  
Sponsored/Competitive Grant Projects. The Centrally Sponsored Scheme, National Mission on  
Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) aims at promoting sustainable agriculture through a series of  
adaptation measures focusing on ten key dimensions encompassing Indian agriculture namely;  
‘Improved crop seeds, livestock and fish cultures’, ‘Water Use Efficiency’, ‘Pest Management’,  
‘Improved Farm Practices’, ‘Nutrient Management’, ‘Agricultural insurance’, ‘Credit support’,  
‘Markets’, ‘Access to Information’ and ‘Livelihood diversification’. NMSA caters to key dimensions  
of ‘Water use efficiency’, ‘Nutrient Management’ and ‘Livelihood diversification’ through adoption  
of sustainable development pathway by progressively shifting to environmental friendly  
technologies, adoption of energy efficient equipment, conservation of natural resources,  
integrated farming, etc.

As analysed in the Doubling Farmer’s Income Report, profiling of vulnerable districts across the  
country has been made by linking climate vulnerability with farmers’ income. The vulnerability  
of agriculture to climate change at district level is drawn from three components such as  
Exposure, Sensitivity and Adaptive Capacity of the districts^45. The same has been set against the  
poorest districts with lowest income status of farmers coming from crop sector as per NSSO-SAS

survey, 2013. Low income reduces the adaptive capacity of the farmers to withstand climate  
shocks and thus increases the risk of the small and marginal farmers further to the adversities of  
climate change effects. The identified Double stressed Districts in terms of Climate Vulnerability  
and Low Farm Income are given in the table below:

These 28 districts are highly vulnerable and disadvantaged in terms of double stress created from  
low farm income as well as high climate vulnerability. These districts require priority attention  
in terms of area specific policy formulation as well as implementation to enhance income of  
farmers, thereby thus raising their adaptive capacity and reducing vulnerability of agriculture to  
climate change in these areas.

Among these identified double stressed districts, the land holdings of farmers are on the lower  
side with most farmers being small and marginal farmers. Also, the number of people depending  
on non-farm income are in minority in these states, thus the majority of people in all these states  
are largely dependent on agriculture. In these climate sensitive states, the percentage of gross  
irrigated area to total cropped area is less than 50% making these areas prone to rainfall  
fluctuations. It is also observed that the area under horticultural crops is also quite low in all these  
states. All these states are also marked by high population and low literacy level in rural areas. It  
is recommended to design programmes to ensure higher growth in these districts. Technological  
programs supported by agricultural science centres like ICAR, SAUs, KVKs etc. can mentor these  
districts in association with state governments.

The HH Survey has analysed the practice around soil conservation among agricultural farmers.  
The graph below shows the findings.

As observed from the graph above, only around 26% of farmers practice soil conservation. The  
various practices of soil conservation have been also analysed and presented in the following  
graph.

Note: The total of all practices can be more than 100% as multiple options are being practiced by farmers

It can be seen from above that around 22% of farmer have practiced terrace farming. Around 32%  
of farmers practice soil conservation techniques like soil or stone bunds, 31% of farmers practice  
techniques like fencing and 17% of farmers opt for planting trees to prevent soil erosion. Around  
17 % of farmers use drainage ditches for soil conservation.

Another important aspect with respect to sustainability of operations relates to practice of  
irrigation at critical stages for reaping maximum benefits. Some of the critical stages of irrigation  
includes tillering, crown root initiation, booting, heading and flowering, blooming and seed  
formation among others. As observed from the graph above, around 75% of farmers practice  
irrigation at critical stages of farming which is a healthy indicator.

**_Crop Diversity_**

Diversification of crops helps in mitigating risks of price shocks and production losses. However,  
the agricultural systems in India have become increasingly reliant on rice and wheat impacting  
crop diversity. The crop diversification index in India has also fallen down from 0.907 in 2011- 12  
to 0.899^46 in 2015-16. A comparison between the total cropped area between 1985-86 to 2013-  
14 suggests that the increase in non-food crop (44%) was much higher than the increase in food  
crops (10%). This is seen as the case of technology led diversification which led to reduction in  
area of coarse cereals, oilseeds and pulses^47. Furthermore, the Economic surveys of India as well  
as Doubling farmers’ income reports have highlighted the need for improving crop diversification  
in country to improve, soil health, productivity and resilience of crops.

Multiple schemes by Government of India as well as state governments are trying to encourage  
crop diversification. NFSM which is one of the major schemes, targets increased production of  
pulses, coarse cereals, nutri-cereals and oil seeds along with rice and wheat to ensure food  
security in India. Interventions under NFSM have targeted increase in area under pulses through  
distribution of quality seeds, field demonstrations, promotion of micronutrients and creation of  
seed hubs. However, the scheme suffers from inadequate staff strength at field level for  
implementation as well as delay in disbursal of funds at state level. Promotion of coarse and nutri-  
cereals is an important component which requires increased attention. MIDH is another scheme  
which is promoting diversification through promotion of activities for increase in horticulture  
production and value chain development. The scheme has been successful in increasing  
horticulture area but is facing challenges in getting quality planting material, marketing of  
produce, delayed funding and variation in performance among states. Also, RAD is giving

precedence to promotion of Integrated Farming Systems. However, majority of interventions are  
for promotion of dairy based integrated farming. In addition, RKVY has also supported  
interventions to shift area from paddy to alternate crops in Punjab, Haryana and Western UP^48.  
In view of the above, there is need to provide more focus on interventions that aim to encourage  
diversification of crops.

**_Water Use Efficiency_**

Indian agriculture is primarily rain-fed, Government of India is putting thrust on scaling up of  
irrigation projects through its various schemes. But variation in rainfall and depleting ground  
water level poses challenge to agriculture; especially when the cropping systems are becoming  
more resource intensive with focus on rice, wheat and sugarcane. To push for increasing water-  
use efficiency, major schemes such as PMKSY and M IDH, are promoting micro-irrigation  
through drip and sprinklers. However, the scale of these schemes is limited for required  
interventions. As can be seen that the progress of PMKSY-PDMC is limited largely to six states and  
mostly concentrated in southern and western region of the country. Penetration of these schemes  
for promoting drip irrigation in northern, eastern and central India remains limited. In addition,  
the impact from adoption of micro-irrigation systems is not being evaluated at field level, which  
can assist in bringing in efficiency and effectiveness. Also, the soil resource mapping and  
classifications are also not being utilised uniformly across all schemes in planning and proposing  
intervention areas.

Box 2 : Floating Gardens - Climate smart agriculture production system in Bangladesh

    Case Study: Floating Gardens - Climate smart agriculture production system in Bangladesh
    Introduction:
    Evidence of climate change in Bangladesh can be seen in an accumulation of heavy rains, frequent
    storms and rising sea levels that result in severe flooding. Due to continuous water-logged conditions,
    crops are often lost and land for agriculture has become scarce. The low-lying areas of the southern
    coastal – and southcentral – districts of Bangladesh remain submerged for 6–8 month periods every
    year, especially during the monsoon season. As a result, crop cultivation is not possible on land.
    Solution:
    A 2015 FAO study in Bangladesh revealed an innovative location-specific adaptation to climate change
    for improving the food security of the nation’s vulnerable people. In the low-lands of Bangladesh, some
    farmers have converted the prolonged flooding season into an opportunity: “floating gardens”. These
    are floating plots made from local organic material on which diversified vegetables are grown or
    seedlings are raised for marketing.
    In this system, farmers prepare the rectangular-shaped beds during June and July and sow/transplant
    seeds eight to ten days after the last stacking to the garden bed. Around 30 species of vegetables, spices
    and other crops or seedlings are grown in this water-based production system. The major vegetable
    crops are okra, ribbed gourd, Indian spinach, brinjal, cucumber, red amaranth, stem amaranth, wax
    gourd and (in winter) turnip, papaya, cabbage, cauliflower, tomato and red amaranth. The spices,
    turmeric and chili are also grown. Mixed intercropping is the most prevalent system.
    Recycling is an important component of this production system. Garden beds are made from local
    organic material (plants) that are almost free, recyclable and do not pollute. When the floodwater
    recedes, decomposed beds are used as compost on the ground to grow winter crops.
    

(^48) Demand supply projections towards, 2033, crops livestock and Agricultural Inputs, NITI aayog, 2018

    59
    

    Impact:
    

*   The FAO study found that farmers operating the floating gardens system received an average gross  
    return of USD 265 and a net return of USD 134 per season. In comparison, when cropping on plain  
    land, farmers received an average gross return of USD 31 and a net return of USD 10. The floating  
    gardens production system clearly increases the farmers’ incomes and is more profitable than  
    vegetable cultivation on plain land.
*   The floating gardens led to a reduction of vulnerability to income of farmers in areas with heavy  
    rainfall.

The share of socially disadvantaged groups among agricultural households in India have been  
given in the chart below.

Distribution of agricultural households by social group for each decile class of monthly per capita  
consumer expenditure (MPCE) reveals the economic status of the socially backward group in the  
country. According to the table given below, the bottom three decile classes had higher  
representation of ST and SC agricultural households compared to their shares in the all classes  
defined by MPCE. The percentages of SC and ST agricultural households in the top two deciles are  
very low. It can be observed that percentage share of ST agricultural households sharply declined  
from about 31 % in the lowest class to little more than 6 % in the highest class. Among the SC  
agricultural households, percentage share of SC households is around 20% in the first six classes  
(except the 5th class) and near about 15 % in the next three classes.

The similar picture is reflected in the distribution of agricultural households by social groups over  
different size classes of land holdings.

Figure 75 : Distribution of agricultural households by social groups

Source: NSS KI (70/33): Key Indicators of Situation of Agricultural Households in India

As it can be seen from the graph above that the percentage share of ST agricultural households  
increased from the lowest size class of land possessed and reached its maximum in the 4th size  
class (1.01-2.00 hectare) and then gradually decreased to its lowest level at the highest size class.  
The percentage share of SC agricultural households decreased gradually from 28 percent in the  
lowest size class to about 3 percent in the highest size class of land possessed.

The findings depicted above implies that there is a persisting economic disparity across different  
disadvantaged social groups. Farmers belonging to the castes and communities that are located  
on the lower rungs of the social hierarchy–henceforth the ‘socially-marginalized castes’–are  
found to have limited access to the factors of agricultural production, which could further result  
in lower farm income.^49 These socially marginalized classes often remain excluded from  
benefiting from rural development programs. The exclusion of the marginalized social groups  
from access to agricultural resources have led to reduction in farm productivity as well as

household income potential of the marginalized communities. According to a study^50 based on  
NSSO Survey of Key Indicators of Situation of Agricultural Households in India, it has been  
observed that economic inequalities among farm households of various social groups in rural  
India emerge largely from caste inequalities in ownership and access to means of production and  
technology. Farmers of the socially-marginalized castes are economically-disadvantaged due to  
three factors: (1) inferior resource endowment status, (2) exclusion from public extension  
networks, and (3) and regional differences in the quality of extension services and infrastructure.

To address the issue of disparities among the socially disadvantaged groups in India and support  
them in their livelihoods associated with agriculture, it is important to analyse the inter-caste  
inequities among farm households of various social groups given there is a dearth of information  
on inter-caste differences in the quality of production resources managed by the farm households,  
which might also contribute to the lower marginal returns to extension services. Policies and  
agricultural extension services focusing on ecosystem, health and natural resource conservation  
alongside improving yield rates is relevant for marginalized farm households.

    vi. Use of IT/Technology in driving efficiency
    

Information technology has been a major driving force for growth in business sectors. In a similar  
way, IT can also influence growth in agriculture by addressing issues around poor access to  
markets and financial services, low levels of human and physical capital, poor access to education  
and weak information flows. With application of ICT, transaction costs can be brought down,  
market reforms and market intelligence can be improved thus increasing efficiency of the food  
value chain. The digital technology can promote efficiency and inclusion alongside, catering to the  
needs of the socio-economically marginalized population.

Information and Communication Technology can contribute in agriculture sector by providing  
accurate information on weather, inputs, markets, and prices; by feeding information into  
research and development initiatives; by disseminating knowledge to farmers; by connecting  
producers and consumers, and through many other avenues^54. The role of ICT in agriculture can  
cater to the following areas^55 :

*   Agricultural extension and advisory services by bridging information gap between  
    agricultural researchers, extension agents and farmers
*   Promote environmentally sustainable farming practices by improving access to climate  
    change solutions
*   Disaster management & early warning system by providing actionable information to  
    communities on disaster prevention in real time
*   Enhanced market access for inputs as well as product marketing
*   Food safety and traceability through reliable data complying with international standards
*   Financial inclusion, insurance & risk management

One of application of ICT in agriculture in India aimed at improving market access for all farmers  
is e-NAM, a pan-India electronic trading platform, which was launched by the government in

2016.  The portal has been designed to create a transparent and competitive price discovery  
    system to help farmers get remunerative prices for their produce. There are 585 wholesale  
    regulated markets of 16 States and 02 Union Territories (UTs) who have been integrated with e-  
    NAM platform. As on 30.06.2019, more than 1.64 crore farmers & more than 1.24 Lakhs traders  
    have registered on e-NAM platform.^56

Figure 78 : Table showing Farmer Registration and Farmer Benefitted under e-NAM portal

Source: https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=191393

As it can be seem from above, the use of the portal has been high in states like Andhra Pradesh,  
Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telengana and Uttar Pradesh. Since there are nearly 26.31  
crore workers engaged in the farm sector^57 , eNAM is yet to reach to the majority of farmers.

Agricultural marketing system can be further strengthened by introducing market intelligence  
collating relevant information on the future demand, price and production scenario which would  
benefit the farmers greatly in minimizing their risk and augment their income. This necessitates  
a framework for precise forecasting of agricultural prices, supply and demand, by developing  
proper mechanisms for collection, compilation, analysis of the appropriate data and the  
dissemination of the information. Currently in India some project mode interventions are being  
conducted for forecasting and projections of different crops.

    project to forecast prices of key commodities for short and medium term using Auto  
    Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling to monthly wholesale price  
    index. Price forecast covers 17 commodities and sub-groups namely rice, wheat, jowar,  
    bajra, maize, pulses, gram, tur, onion, potato, groundnut seeds, rapeseed & mustard,  
    soyabean, edible oil, and food products.

2.  Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has been implementing a network project  
    on market intelligence by creating the grid of Agricultural Market Intelligence Centres in  
    India. The aim of this project is to help farmers in taking sowing and marketing decisions  
    based on scientific information and to get better prices for their produce ultimately. Two  
    types of price forecasts on agriculture commodities were generated and disseminated.  
    ‘Pre-sowing forecasts’ are released to help farmers on sowing and area allocation  
    decisions and ‘pre-harvest-forecast’ to take decisions on whether to sell the produce  
    immediately or store for some period for price advantage in the future. The intervention  
    included 34 mandatory crops and the required data was collected from regulated markets  
    identified in each state to represent the crop. The price forecasts generated were  
    validated by interacting with traders, farmers, other commodity specific websites and  
    also in futures platform. The adoption of market advisory has led to higher income among  
    traders than non-adopters.  
    The use of technology to create commodity reports thus helped in knowledge sharing and  
    information dissemination among beneficiary farmers. Farmers could understand the current  
    knowledge on market information and market intelligence, access current source of market  
    demand and generate better revenue from their produce. However, forecasting of commodity  
    prices and demand is not under the purview of any department, in spite of several ongoing  
    interventions involved in compilation, monitoring and release of prices/price indices by  
    various organizations. Implementation of market intelligence in the country would require  
    robust data collection mechanism for crop forecasting. Information on harvested quantity,  
    demand of commodities along with projections is required to be evaluated. Engagement of  
    private IT sector can add value to the endeavour of establishing market intelligence system.

Box 3 : Grading agriculture produce through artificial intelligence to boost farmer income

    Case Study: Grading agriculture produce through artificial intelligence to boost farmer income
    Introduction/Challenge:
    Standardization and grading are the first steps in the value-chain of an agricultural produce as it travels
    in a market channel to the consumer. Variations in quality of agricultural produce has led to
    incommensurate prices for farmers. The assessment of produce quality depends on a responsive
    system of grading and standardization, which can be quite subjective in absence of a good grading
    mechanism.
    Every consumer wants high quality fruits and vegetables, which are not over-ripe, discoloured, or
    damaged. The process of quality testing is done manually, with inspectors physically checking a sample
    from every lot. This makes the testing subjective, allowing errors to creep in.
    Solution:
    Bengaluru-based start-up Intello Labs set out to provide advanced image recognition technology that
    can recognize objects, flora, fauna and tag them in any image. The company uses deep learning
    algorithms on which a new generation of intelligent applications are built for applications in
    agriculture.
    Intello’s AI can generate instantaneous quality metrics based on a photo taken on a basic smart phone.
    This enables Agricultural Product Grading, which entails automated quality analysis of images of food
    products, which is an accurate and reliable method for grading fresh products (fruits, grains,
    vegetables, cotton etc.) characterized by color, size and shape. Its tools help in bringing transparency
    

    65
    

    and standardization to quality assessment, reducing value risk and wastage in the agriculture supply
    chains. It has developed a ready-to-use solution for fruits, vegetables and spices.
    Impact:
    

*   The company claims that its image analytics and AI testing can give B2B players savings of between  
    three and five percent.
*   Standardisation and digitisation of produce can go a long way in making e-Mandis and digital agri  
    markets successful.

    vii. Development, dissemination & adoption of innovative practices, technology & know-
    how
    

Agriculture in India is practiced across different climatic zones and to increase the productivity  
of the agricultural commodities an entire range of innovative cultivation technology is applied.  
Various technological innovations have been developed in order to adapt to the local needs,  
optimally use the naturally available resources and cater to the needs of the changing market  
demand. In the wake of climate change and rising stress on all natural resources, sustainable  
growth in agriculture can be only ensured through constant improvisation of production  
processes. Climate smart agricultural technologies can sustainably improve production,  
resilience of production systems, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to ensure food security.

Precision farming increases agricultural productivity while decreasing production cost and  
minimizing environmental impacts. Precision agriculture is based on information technology,  
which enables the producer to collect information and data for better decision making. This  
system of farming includes application of Global Position System (GPS) in the agriculture fields,  
close monitoring of crop, soil and climate information and finally analysis of the data to  
understand the accurate agricultural inputs required for optimum and sustainable output.  
However in India, most farmers are small and marginal farmers with small field size, making  
precision farming an unviable option. The small size of farms and fields in most of Indian  
agriculture limits economic gains from currently available precision farming technology, but  
other factors in Indian agriculture such as concerns for the environment, food safety and need to  
increase productivity stresses on immense potential and benefits of precision agriculture.

In India precision farming is yet to evolve and practiced by most farmers. However, some of the  
early adoptions of the practice show desirable results. The Tamil Nadu Precision Farming Project  
was implemented over three years (2004-2007) in the districts of Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri in  
the northern part of Tamil Nadu.^58 The project focused on increasing the yield of horticulture  
crops in areas which were considered to be backward, impoverished and water-scarce dominated  
by traditional agricultural practices. The precision farming technology inputs applied to the  
project were drip irrigation using Class 3 fertigation units along with water soluble fertilizers  
(WSF), the use of community nurseries, use of remote sensing technologies to develop a  
fertigation schedule according to crop and soil type, grading and sorting techniques and detailed

documentation of farm activities. The impact of the farming showed evidences of increased yield  
and also increased level of income.

Currently Precision Farming Development Centres (PFDCs) have been established in India to  
promote “Precision Farming & Plasticulture Applications for hi-tech horticulture” and located in  
State Agricultural Universities (SAUs); ICAR Institutes such as IARI, New Delhi; CIAE, Bhopal &  
CISH, Lucknow and IIT, Kharagpur^59. National Committee on Plasticulture Applications in  
Horticulture (NCPAH) conducts the adoption of precision farming practices in horticulture  
through various trials, demonstrations and extension programs. There are around 22 such PFDC  
have been operating to promote various plasticulture applications in horticulture. Plasticulture  
is one of the precision farming practices which uses plastics in agriculture and horticulture for  
moisture conservation, water saving, reduction in fertilizer consumption, precision in application  
of nutrients as well use of innovative packaging solutions help in increasing shelf-life and during  
collection, storage & transportation of fruits and vegetables.

Practices around Micro Irrigation in India have been discussed earlier in the section on Irrigation.  
Appropriate technology interventions like drip & sprinkler irrigation systems are being  
promoted across the country under the scheme Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna- Per Drop  
More Crop. However the current coverage of micro irrigation has only reached 10.25 million  
hectares^60 which constitutes 15% of the total potential area of 69 million hectares^61. The coverage  
of micro irrigation has been presented for the top 10 states in the graph below.

Currently, the practice is taken up widely in the water stressed states. However, agrarian states  
like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal have much lower achievement in micro irrigation. The  
same is also observed in the hilly states like Himachal Pradesh and states of the North East.  
Difficulty in constructing drip and sprinkler irrigation is one of the main challenges behind the

PMKSY –Per Drop More Crop.

In India, Tata Kisan Kendra (an initiative under Tata Chemicals) applied technological  
innovations to support the conventional farming system (i.e. tilling the soil to prepare for  
planting, and heavy reliance on chemical inputs, such as pesticides and fertilizers). Use of remote  
sensing technology to analyze soil, inform about crop health, pest attacks and coverage of various  
crops predicting the final output are put into practice to reap healthier crops, higher yields and  
enhanced incomes for farmers. Trainings are imparted from the centers to farmers through  
workshops and screening of films related to good practices. The crop clinics under Tata Kisan  
Kendra (TKK) access information from the geographic information system (GIS) and advise  
farmers on what to grow, where and when to grow it, and how much urea and nutrients to use.  
At the soil-testing laboratory, technicians analyze soil samples to determine their composition  
and confirm what the satellite maps have indicated. Additionally, the TKK network operates  
experimental farms where scientists conduct agricultural research and development. Tata Kisan  
Kendra has been replicated successfully in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab.

As observed in HH Survey, around 76% of farmers have awareness about soil health and around  
38 % of farmers own soil health card. The findings have been displayed in the graph below.

Similarly the HH survey has also revealed knowledge level and practices of seed treatment by  
farmers. The graphs above display the awareness and practice around seed treatment by  
agricultural farmers. It can be observed from the graphs above that 4 2 % of agricultural farmers  
have awareness of seed treatment. 67 % of farmers practice seed treatment methods.

Box 4 : Use of predictive analytics in agriculture

    Case Study: Use of predictive analytics in agriculture
    Introduction/Challenge:
    Typically, farmers in India use age-old methods to predict the right sowing date for their crops. While
    these methods had worked well in the past, the changing weather patterns in the past decade have led
    to unpredictable monsoons, causing poor crop yields. This impacted farmers’ incomes and increased
    their vulnerabilities, causing many to commit suicides as they could not repay their loans on time.
    Solution:
    Microsoft partnered with International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and
    Andhra Pradesh government to develop the Sowing App, a mobile application that uses predictive
    analytics to advise Indian farmers on the best time to sow crops, depending on weather conditions,
    soil, and other key indicators. The app aims to reduce failures and increase yield by arming farmers
    with information helpful in making critical decisions.
    To calculate the crop-sowing period, historic climate data spanning over 30 years, from 1986 to 2015
    in Andhra Pradesh was analyzed using AI. To determine the optimal sowing period, the Moisture
    Adequacy Index (MAI) was calculated. MAI is the standardized measure used for assessing the degree
    of adequacy of rainfall and soil moisture to meet the potential water requirement of crops. The real-
    time MAI is calculated from the daily rainfall recorded and reported by the Andhra Pradesh State
    Development Planning Society. The future MAI is calculated from weather forecasting models for the
    area provided by USA-based aWhere Inc. This data is then downscaled to build predictability, and
    guide farmers to pick the ideal sowing week.
    Sowing advisories are then initiated and disseminated until the harvesting is complete. The advisories
    contain essential information including the optimal sowing date, soil test based fertilizer application,
    farm yard manure application, seed treatment, optimum sowing depth, and more. In tandem with the
    app, a personalized village advisory dashboard provides important insights into soil health,
    recommended fertilizer, and seven-day weather forecasts.
    Impact:
    In 2017, the program touched more than 3,000 farmers across the states of Andhra Pradesh and
    Karnataka during the Kharif crop cycle (rainy season) for a host of crops including groundnut, ragi,
    maize, rice and cotton, among others. The increase in yield ranged from 10% to 30% across crops.

**_viii. Stakeholder & Beneficiary Behavioural Change_**

Agriculture sector is India is deterred by the problems of low yield in the agricultural produce  
which mostly stems from the lack of knowledge among farmers and poor access to good quality  
inputs. The recent study assessing the conditions of farmers called “State of Indian Farmers” by  
Centre for Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) throws light on the prevailing practices and  
problems faced by the farmers. The study included more than 5000 samples from 137 districts of  
the country in 2014. As per the findings, around 76% of the farmers wanted to give up farming.

    69
    

Farmers reported issues of repeated losses in farming and have been affected by unseasonal  
rains, droughts, floods and pest attacks.

Good Agricultural Practices in India are being promoted under the certification called INDGAP^62  
which is being implemented by the Quality Council of India. In line with the recommendation of  
World Trade Organization, INDGAP incorporates concepts of globally accepted Good Agricultural  
Practices (GAP) within the framework of commercial agricultural production for long term  
improvement and sustainability. INDGAP takes into account not only the quality and quantity of  
the produce obtained from a unit area but also care is taken in integrating pre-harvest practices  
like soil & water management, nutrient management and pest management, harvesting, post-  
harvest handling and other logistics. The areas around good agricultural practices focused under  
the scheme INDGAP aims to cater to the following aspects^63 :

*   quality and quantity of the produce obtained from a unit area
*   various aspects of food safety
*   pre and post-harvest practices including workers health and safety
*   sustained supply of produce of the desirable quality

Development of the voluntary sustainability standard such as INDGAP focuses on the adoption of  
certification by small and marginal farmers under the accreditation of National Accreditation  
Board for Certification Bodies under the scheme component INDGAP Basic^64.

In the global scenario of certified agriculture and good agricultural practices, International Trade  
Center provides insights into the progress on the widely accepted sustainability standards for  
select agricultural products (namely bananas, cocoa, coffee, cotton, oil palm, soybeans, sugarcane,  
tea, and forestry products). Complying with the United Nations 2030 Agenda, the voluntary  
sustainable standards have been set to address the issue of unsustainable consumption and  
production as flagged under United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12. The report “State  
of Sustainable Markets 2019”^65 uncovers the expansion in sustainably certified agricultural and  
forestry commodities. Two of the 14 voluntary sustainability standards discussed in the  
aforementioned report, Global G.A.P and Organic have been considered to discuss the progress of  
India in comparison to the top performers across the globe.

Global G.A.P. or the Global Partnership for Good Agricultural Practices includes 40 standards set  
for entire agro food sector that covers food safety, environmental aspects, as well as worker  
health and safety. It covers crops, livestock and aquaculture production and also ensures product  
segregation and traceability of certified products. The top countries with highest certified area  
under Global GAP has been depicted in the graph below.

Similar to the GlobalGAP certification, Organic certification is implemented across the globe. More  
than 69.8 million hectares were organic-certified in 2017 (including land that is in the process of  
becoming certified as organic), representing 1.4% of all agricultural land worldwide^66. The  
multiple commodity sustainability standard has the largest variety of agricultural products

Under the Good Agricultural Practices in India, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is practiced  
among farmers to keep pest population at below economic threshold levels by employing all  
available alternate pest control methods, especially bio-pesticides and pesticides of plant-origin  
like Neem formulations. Chemical fertilizers are used as last resort. This technique has helped to  
control the indiscriminate and unilateral use of pesticides and contain ill effects like human and  
animal health hazards, ecological imbalance, development of resistance in the pests to pesticides,  
pests resurgence and environmental pollution. Under the Sub Mission on Plant Protection and  
Plant Quarantine introduced in 2014-15, strengthening and modernization of Pest Management  
Approach in India is being promoted and IPM is being popularized through training and  
demonstration in crops inter-alia promotion of biological control approaches in crop protection  
technology. Several Central Integrated Pest Management Centres^67 (31 Centers) have been setup  
for pest/disease monitoring, production and release of bio-control agents/ bio-pesticides,  
conservation of bio-control agents by imparting training to Agriculture / Horticulture Extension  
Officers and farmers at Grass Root Level by organizing Farmers Field Schools (FFSs) in farmers’  
fields.

The 31 Central Integrated Pest Management Centers (CIPMCs) located in 28 States and one Union  
Territory undertakes the programme with following activities:

*   Surveillance & Monitoring of insect-pest & diseases.
*   Augmentation and Conservation of Natural enemies.
*   Production and release of bio-control agents.

The HH survey also throws light on the level of awareness around Integrated Pest Management  
(IPM) and practices around it. The graph below depicts the awareness and practice among  
agricultural farmers.

It can be observed from the graphs above that around 56.6% of agricultural farmers are aware of  
Integrated Pest Management. However, 47 % of farmers have been practicing Integrated Pest  
Management in their farms.

**Low adoption of technology and recommendations**

Concerns have been raised in NSSO surveys about the reach of the extension services and level of  
technology adoption. Similarly, a study on level of adoption of Drip irrigation in Tamil Nadu  
highlighted that the level of adoption of drip irrigation has been low among small and marginal  
farmers, as it has high initial costs and requires regular maintenance. It was also highlighted that  
the large farmers are more likely to shift to drip irrigation as they can afford the initial costs and  
know its benefits in optimising the water use and reduction in labour costs^68. It was also observed  
during the field surveys and KIIs that adoption of micro-irrigation is more in water scarce areas  
where farmers intend to grow water intensive agricultural and horticultural crops. Therefore,  
while the adoption of micro-irrigation may help in efficient use of water it may not prevent loss  
of ground water, and the micro-irrigation activities needs to be supported by interventions for  
ground water recharge.

In addition, the need for a scientific approach by providing customized input recommendations  
specific and suitable to crops, weather and soil fertility as well as advice on financial viability of  
crops and marketing trends has been observed. Soil health card is one such initiative that can be  
helpful in transforming agriculture but is facing infrastructural and implementation challenges  
leading to reluctance in adoption of recommendation of SHC. Apart from soil health card other  
aspects such as crop specific use of pesticides, integrated pest management, advisory on weather  
fluctuations, disease control, water use, etc. are not adequately covered in current set of schemes.

In addition, the knowledge about market related information and existing trends is very poor  
among farmers, because of which many suffer losses even when the production is good. Farmers  
need to be provided customized solutions which include recommendations on productivity and  
marketing of produce.

**Lack of remunerative prices and MSPs impact on production**

It is important to note that despite the increase in agricultural production, the contribution of  
agriculture and allied sector in overall GVA has been consistently declining since 2012-13. This  
diminishing trend is a concern, as agriculture still is the primary source of livelihood for more  
than 58% HHs in rural India and provides employment to 43.9% of country’s total workforce.  
One of the primary reasons towards this reduction may be attributed to increasing cost of  
production and wide gap between farm-gate price and consumer prices, as only a small share of  
consumer price reaches farmers. The prices further slump during the peak arrival season when  
there is good production. Therefore, procurement made by the government at MSP of select crops  
ensures that the farmers get a better value for their produce, moreover, if procurement is done at  
right time it prevents the prices of the commodity to fall below MSP level and help in stabilising  
the prices. That is why, the farmers prefer to go for crops which are more likely to be procured  
by the government at MSP. MSP is more appealing as many state governments also announce  
bonuses on top of the MSP which make growing of these crops a better proposition. However,  
both central and state agencies only procure select crops at MSP and majority of state and central  
level procurement are for rice and wheat, so farmers prefer to grow rice or wheat as the risks are  
limited. Therefore, in order promote crop diversification the immediate need is to improve the  
marketing and storage facilities for alternative crops. Reforms in marketing and risk management  
are crucial to change the mind-set of farmers to make more investments in alternative crops  
especially in rainfed regions^69.

**Making extension activities more effective**

The increasing cost of production and wide gap between farm-gate price and consumer prices  
has called for increased focus of government towards making agriculture more remunerative.  
Agriculture extension plays a key role in facilitating the same. While the state agricultural  
department and schemes such as SMAE, MIDH, etc. are trying to promote good practices among  
farmers, they face constraints in terms of availability of extension workers and resources. One of  
the flagship initiative under SAME is ATMA which is seen as a good programme, however, has not  
been effectively implemented. The report of the Committee on Doubling Farmers Income  
highlighted that capacity building of extension functionaries was not sustained, leading to  
achievement of less-than-potential outcomes. This, combined with attrition-ridden and unstable  
contractual manpower has been responsible for non-achievement of targets. The report also  
pointed out that both public and private extension systems highlight on “what to do”, rather than  
also educating on “what not to do”. The latter is equally critical for farmers who are practising  
agriculture from generations and are thus sticking to traditional practices. The farmers, thus,  
need to be sensitized not only on new practices but also on the need or ineffectiveness of ongoing  
habits to pre-empt risks and failures. ATMA which has been envisioned to facilitate linking  
farmers to market has been restricted to advisory on production aspects, without catering to  
marketing concerns.

    ix. Research and Development
    

Advancement in agriculture can be ensured through continuous research and development in the  
domain impacting climate change concerns, food insecurity, the growing relevance of agri-food  
chains, and demands for greater rural producer empowerment. The research studies along with  
the applications of the innovative solutions and providing extension services such as policy  
advise, technical support, projects/ programmes, studies and workshops shall lead to accelerated  
development of the sector.

In India, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is an apex research organization of  
the country, spearheading agricultural research, education and extension activities for  
productivity enhancement and diversification of Indian agriculture. Along with ICAR, the National  
Agricultural Research and Education System (NARES) is also one of the top research institutes  
contributing to transformative changes in this domain. ICAR has a vast network^70 of 96 ICAR  
institutes, 77 All India Coordinated Projects/Networks, four deemed universities, two Central  
Agricultural Universities and 641 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) spread across the country. In  
addition, there are 62 state Agricultural/ Veterinary/ Horticultural/ Fishery universities and 4  
general universities with agricultural faculty, as part of the NARES. The research programs under  
the umbrella of ICAR are designed to harnessing the power of science and technology that  
promotes food, nutritional and livelihood security of vast population of our country. In the past,  
ICAR had been instrumental in ushering Green Revolution in agriculture. The ICAR along with its  
partners in the NARES through research and technology developments, enabled the country to  
increase the production of foodgrains by 5-fold, horticultural crops by 6-fold, fish by 12-fold  
(marine 5-fold and inland 17-fold), milk by 8 - fold, and eggs by 27-fold since 1950- 5171.

In the recent years^72 there has been significant effort towards improving crop yield through  
producing high yielding crop varieties. In the year 2018, ICAR has developed 372 HYV crops  
comprising of 200 of cereals, 49 oilseeds, 47 of pulses, 47 of commercial crops and 29 of forage  
crops. Eight bio-fortified varieties of rice, wheat, maize, pearl millets, and lentils having high iron,  
zinc, selenium and protein has been developed. Research on genetic augmentation, and  
conservation is being pursued intensively across crop varieties and also in various geographies  
in an attempt to build a genebank. In crop improvement, there has been considerable focus on  
seed technology research and production of breeder seeds. In the year 2017-18, around 5,97,992  
quintals of quality seeds had been produced against the target of 3,66,059 quintals which  
comprised of foundation seeds, certified seeds, truthfully labelled seeds and planting materials.  
Extensive research has been made in zero-budget farming and other indigenous agricultural  
technologies to control pest population using pheromones in fruits. Impact of climate change in  
wheat is being pursued along with designing adaptation technologies for the same. Agroforestry  
system for sustainable crop yields in rainfed areas are being evaluated in various horticulture and  
agriculture crops such as amla, fingermillet, custard apple, maize, tamarind among others.

The application of the innovative solutions has been ensured through continuous extension  
activities by the Krishi Vigyan Kendras. In 2018, a total of 3354 technologies of various crops were  
assessed in 2981 locations by KVKs under the thematic areas of drudgery reduction, farm  
machineries, integrated crop management, integrated disease management, integrated nutrient

management, pest management, agro-processing and value addition. The capacity building  
programmes included various front line demonstrations and trainings were provided to farmers,  
farmer groups, and other practitioners.

As stated in the ICAR Vision 2050, the institute accords highest priority to changing needs of  
farmers, which would provide the direction of future research and education investment areas.  
The focus areas of research laid by the institution for the country include:

*   Genetic potential enhancement of agricultural commodities
*   Agricultural productivity, efficiency and profitability improvement
*   Resilience to climate change and abiotic and biotic stresses
*   Improve nutritional food, and health security
*   Risk management against climate change and market stressors
*   Agricultural value chains
*   Sustainability of natural resources base of agriculture
*   Valuation of ecosystem services
*   Agricultural markets, policies, and institutions
*   Bio-security, especially the one emerging from gene piracy and cross-border vector-  
    borne diseases
*   New products and uses (e.g., bio-energy, new crops, synthetic foods, special foods)
*   New educational and learning systems and environments

**Need for Public Private Partnership in Research and development**

The Indian Council of Agriculture Research is an autonomous organisation under the Department  
of Agricultural Research and Education. It has more than 100 institutes under its purview. ICARs  
play a critical role in agricultural education and research in India and is supported through central  
funds. There are 27 institutes that deal with the crop sciences, 23 deal with horticulture sciences  
and 19 Institutes that deal with Animal Sciences under ICAR in India. In addition, it has 8 fisheries  
institutes, 4 Agricultural engineering institutes and 15 institutes under its NRM division. These  
institutes primarily deal with aspects such as crop science, animal husbandry, dairying, fisheries  
and horticultural sciences. Apart from these, ICAR also controls institutions that deal with  
agricultural education and extension institutes. The ICAR institutions receive funding from  
central government, they also earn income through education, research and extension activities.  
The BE for ICAR during 2018-19 was Rs 7514.14 crores, which increased by nearly 14.7% from  
2017 - 18. The BE allocation for various types of institutes under ICAR is provided in the figure  
below.

    77

As can be seen that the highest budget allocation is for Crop Science Institutions, followed by  
Animal Sciences Institutes and Agricultural Extension Institutes. The lowest budget is being  
allocated to Agricultural economics and statistics. In addition to these, there are projects like  
NAHEP and NICRA, which receive separate funding.

The table below shows expenses on research and operations as a percentage of revenue and  
capital expenses across different types of institutes in 2017- 18.

As can be seen that the overall budget allocated for research and operations among these ICAR  
institutes is very small and ranges between 6 to 12.2%. Among these institutes, NRM institutions  
are focusing very little on research, while horticulture and animal science institutes are giving  
higher priority to research. It may be noted that higher funds are allocated to these institutions.

connect is weakening and most of the scientific energy is being spent on mundane research across  
the institutions. It was highlighted that the collaboration of institutions needs to be strengthened  
and the research should be targeted towards solving problems. The report calls for overhaul of  
public sector R&D institutions and create favourable environment agricultural research and  
technology development. It recommended to put in place performance indicators for institutions  
and individuals and need for modifying the existing rules and regulations to facilitate public  
private partnerships in agriculture research.

    x. Reforms and Regulations
    

Reforms in agriculture sector in India is one of the important factor for driving faster growth and  
ensuring better remunerations from agriculture as an option of livelihoods. The agriculture  
sector contributes around 14.4% to the economy of the country in terms of Gross Value Added  
from agriculture, forestry & fishing sector. This sector has been aiming to achieve higher growth  
through notable changes such as diversification from grains towards pulses, fruit, vegetables and  
livestock products, along with a greater focus on exports of agricultural supplies.

With government impetus on food and nutritional security over the past decades, India has been  
able to transform from a food deficit country to a major exporter of agriculture and allied  
products such as rice, meat and meat products, cotton, oilcakes, vegetable extracts, fish and fish  
products. The demand for agriculture products have shifted from cereal consumption towards  
pulses, fruit and vegetables as well as meat and meat products. The share of cereals in calorie  
intake decreased from 61% in 2000 to 55.7% in 2013, with livestock products increasing from  
12.8% to 17.1% and fruit and vegetables from 24.5% to 28.7% over the same period.^74 In order  
to support the dietary shift, structural changes are required to be brought in through organizing  
the private sector and modernizing the retail sector.

One of the critical factors to foster growth in agricultural production is by enabling access to farm  
credit, under which Kisan Credit Card scheme had been introduced in 1998 to ensure farmers  
could purchase agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides etc. and draw cash for their  
production needs.^75 However, institutional credit, especially long and medium term credit  
availability is still inadequate compared to the demand. Small and marginal farmers face  
difficulties in accessing agricultural credit since it is linked to holding of formal land titles.

Along with growth in food production, the agro-food supply chain has been increasing  
consistently over the last few decades. The growth in the supply chain requires establishment of  
physical infrastructure and logistics creation. However there has been inadequate progress in  
developing road transport services and freight services to support the food supply chain in the  
country. Government regulated markets wholesale markets (mandis) do not have the facilities  
needed for handling, grading and storing perishable agricultural products and the regulatory  
environment has deterred private sector involvement^76. The current regulation, Agricultural  
Produce Marketing (Regulation) Acts empowers the state to establish regulated wholesale  
markets, construct and manage agricultural markets and regulate all aspects of marketing,

including the levy of user fees. However, there are several constraints to this Act concerning  
highly fragmented market structure, insufficient number of markets, inadequate physical  
marketing infrastructure, high incidence of marketing fees and charges, high post-harvest waste,  
restrictions in licensing, low remuneration to farmers and high intermediation costs, market  
information asymmetry, and inadequate credit facilities.^77 To address this issue, the model  
Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017 is underway  
to include reforms such as issuing single or trading within the State and at the National level, and  
including new private players and traders to establish wholesale agri-markets among others. The  
new Act intends to ensure better price realization through a transparent system.

The agro-food trade as share of agricultural GDP in India is pegged at 16% as of 2016 and has  
increased significantly post the economic reforms after 1990. However, the sector has potential  
to grow further given the strong growth of merchandise trade in the country (pegged at 42% of  
the GDP as of 2016) and plausible improvements in the currently challenged domestic agro-food  
value chain structure. The trade regulations set by India’s Foreign Trade Policy every five years  
drive the growth in agro-food trade sector. Some agricultural products have been subject to  
export prohibitions, export quotas, and minimum export prices. State trading is required for some  
products, and export subsidies are provided. The government provides financial assistance to  
exporters for market development, infrastructure development, quality development and  
transport assistance. Certain export prohibitions imposed in 2014 on pulses (not chickpeas) and  
to all edible oil, have now been removed (except for mustard oil)^78. However, tightening of the  
rules on marketing buffaloes for slaughter is likely to negatively affect the production of buffalo  
meat for exports and for producing milk.

**Policy and Legislative Reforms Related to Marketing**^79

The Directorate of Agricultural Marketing was first established to keep the prices of agriculture-  
based raw material for industries and food items in check. Since marketing of agricultural  
produce is a concurrent subject, most states enacted the Agricultural Produce Market Regulation  
Act (APMR Act) and all primary wholesale markets operating in the state were bought within the  
ambit of these acts. The legislation prevented private players from setting up markets. Over the  
years, the markets became more localised with limited infrastructure which curtailed the free  
movement of commodities and resulted in the fragmentation of markets. Over time large number  
of intermediaries established their foothold which led to multiple levels of charges; resulting in  
the escalation of costs for consumers and lower margins for farmers. Realising this, Government  
of India introduced a series of reforms to increase efficiency in market transactions to  
commensurate benefits for farmers. Key reforms introduced in the past two decades are  
illustrated as follows.

Figure 88 : Key Reforms Introduced in the Sector

The Model Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation Act) in 2003 was  
introduced to encourage private investment in agricultural marketing. It created a window of  
opportunity for private players for entering in agricultural marketing. Alternate market channels  
were developed in few states as a result of these reforms.

Direct marketing, contract farming and private markets are three major marketing channels  
which have evolved after these reforms. The model act also had the provision for private  
wholesale markets. Further, liberatlisation took place in 2004 as ban on future trading of 54  
commodities was lifted and licensing norms for food processing industries were liberalised.

The registration rules under the Warehousing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2006  
introduced Negotiable Warehouse Receipt (NWR) in 2010. The NWR is issued in token of  
acceptance of the produce and provides an assurance that it will remain safe up to the end of  
storage period mentioned in the receipt. NWR enables transfer of ownership of the commodity  
without having to deliver the physical commodity. It is also eligible as collateral for short term  
finance. The rules were amended in 2017 to allow the issuance of e-NWR as part of the next level  
reforms. It is now compulsory for all WDRA registered warehouses to issue e-NWR warehouse  
receipts. An e-NWR minimizes risks in transactions and ensures better transparency.

Government of India launched the ambitious National Agricultural Market scheme in 2016 as an  
effort towards market integration of various APMCs functional across India. Its initial phase  
targeted the integration of 585 markets across India.The scheme is aimed at the integration of

agricultural markets across India to facilitate pan-India trade. This will help in price stabilisation  
and better marketing opportunities for farmers and sellers. The scheme also provides for the  
development of infrastructure and quality assaying facilities for selected commodities at market  
level^80.

The states are also required to take following mandatory reforms in their APMC Acts.

*   Provision for single trading license which is valid across the State
*   Single point of levy of market fee across the State; and
*   Provision for e-auction / e-trading as a mode of price discovery to be facilitated by the  
    State Agriculture Marketing Department / Board / APMCs / Regulated Market  
    Committees (RMCs), as the case may be.

The challenges related to e-NAM and direct marketing are elaborated in ISAM scheme analysis  
and issue and challenges sections of the report.

The model APML act has also been introduced in 2017. The new act allows more players to set up  
markets; it also introduces other reforms such as a cap on market and commission agents fee and  
introduces provisions for declaration of warehouses/silos/cold storage as market sub-yards. The  
Act allows farmers to sell their produce to preferred buyers at a place of their choice. The model  
act also has provisions on livestock marketing, e-trading, contract farming and standardization  
and quality certification. It also sought states to put restrictions on mandi tax limits. However,  
many are yet to adapt the model act and have adopted only some of its provisions.

The lack of integration in existing marketing infrastructure from aggregation, assaying,  
transportation, storage and distribution and lack of differentiated approach in infrastructure  
development with mere focus on only storage of excess produce were highlighted as key  
bottleneck in appropriate price realisation for farmers^81. The interventions for increasing price  
realisation to farmers needs to be supported by stable trade regime and a more farmer oriented  
policy shift^82. A need to liberalize stock limits and control regulations has also been highlighted  
in multiple reports^83 to promote agribusiness and exports of key agricultural commodities.

In view of this, the recent ordinances have been introduced which further liberalise the  
amendment acts, the new set of ordinances introduced in 2020 have also proposed new set of  
reforms, some of which are in-line with the some of the key bottlenecks highlighted in sectoral  
analysis and scheme analysis marketing schemes. For instance, the recent ordinance amends the  
Essential Commodities Act, 19 5 5 and eases the restrictions on stock limits imposed by the older  
versions of the act. The ordinance also restricts the imposition of stock limits on essential  
commodities to instances wherein substantial rise in retail price of the commodity is recorded.  
The Farmer's Produce Trade And Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020,  
states that no market fee or levy shall be levied for scheduled produce in a trade area, it also  
includes state APMC act or other state laws. This is similar to the model APLM act, however, the  
key difference is that the ordinance has defined the scheduled produce and also exempted the  
transaction from levy under other state acts. This reform is likely to ease transactions of

commodities in the state and help in controlling the price of commodity. However, the impact of  
ordinance has to be evaluated carefully, considering that the farmers do not pay mandi taxes but  
the traders or commission agents have to pay. In addition, it has been observed that farmers tend  
to get better price realisation in market yards due to regulation and competition, trading in  
markets also help them in getting price related information. Many states have already made  
amendments so that the farmers are able to sell their produce anywhere in state. After the  
ordinance, the waiving off of market fee for trade outside market premises may encourage the  
traders to purchase the produce outside of the market premise. This may make the market yards  
and premises less useful and regulation of trade difficult, resulting in farmers may not receiving  
the right price due to absence of regulation.

The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services  
Ordinance, 2020 as the name suggests seeks to promote price assurance for farmers by providing  
a national framework on farming agreements. This will enable farmers to engage with agri-  
business firms, retailers, wholesalers, exporters for farm services and sale of produce.

    xi. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives (e.g.
    Farmer cooperatives, FPOs, Water User Associations, etc.) and civil society in the
    scheme
    

Agricultural cooperatives are socio-economic organizations which have played a significant role  
across the world in organizing the small farmers who are responsible for 80% of the world food  
production^84. With a presence of 85% small and marginal farmers in India, it is critical to enhance  
the impact of the cooperative sector and create opportunities and income for marginal farmers  
in the country. Various grass-root institutions have been formed to represent the farmers’  
community, facilitated by state / national level Boards, Cooperatives and Corporations. Some of  
the formal decentralized organizations are Gram Sabhas, Watershed Committees, Forest  
Management Committees, Milk Societies, PACSs (Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies),  
APMCs (Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees), and WAUs (Water User Associations).  
Voluntary institutions like SHGs (Self Help Groups), JLGs (Joint Liability Groups), Commodity  
Interest Groups (CIGs), FPOs (Farmer Producer Organizations – both cooperatives and  
companies) have been formed across the country and brought under the purview of NABARD,  
SFAC and NRLM for further structured facilitation, capacity building and nurturing.

Presently, around 5000 FPOs (including FPCs) are in existence in the country, which have been  
formed under various initiatives of the Govt. of India (including SFAC), State Governments,  
NABARD and other organizations over the last 8-10 years. Of these, around 3200 FPOs are  
registered as Producer Companies and the remaining as Cooperatives/ Societies, etc.

In India, FPOs are supported primarily by two organizations namely,

1.  NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development)
2.  SFAC (Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Consortium)

The total state-wise bifurcation of FPOs supported by NABARD as well as by SFAC as on 15th  
August 2019 are highlighted below on the map of India:

The total number of FPOs under NABARD and SFAC as of August 2019 is estimated to be 5135  
with 1690405 members enrolled. The top states with highest number of FPOs constituting  
around 80% of the total FPOs^85 registered under NABARD and SFAC have been depicted in the

Majority of these FPOs (including FPCs) in India are at a nascent stage of their operations with  
shareholder membership ranging from 100 to over 1000 farmers and require not only technical  
handholding support but also adequate capital and infrastructure facilities including market  
linkages for sustaining their business operations.

According to the HH Survey, around 37.5% of farmers are part of a Self Help Group or producer  
group. The findings of the HH analysis has been provided in the graph below.

Around 37.5% of farmers who were part of some SHG, producer group or cooperative have been  
able to access better quality inputs, 2 3 % of farmers have experienced improvement in  
productivity, and 23% of farmers could avail better access to markets.

**Leveraging start-up eco-system for strengthening value chains by engaging private players**

Private sector participation under various schemes has been quite limited. Private sector  
engagement can help in driving technology led innovation, extension, logistics and forward  
linkages.

India is supporting agri-tech start-ups that are engaged in diverse set of activities and  
strengthening of value chain creation. Incubator support programs targeting agri-startups have  
been launched through Startup India. In addition, all Indian states also have policies and  
incentives that support agri-startups in India. Government supported institutions such as  
MANAGE, PUSA, NIAM are also engaged in supporting agri-tech entrepreneurs. Many IIMs and

IITs also provide incubation support to agri-tech firms. Among the schemes, RKVY is encouraging  
innovative practices through encouragement to agri-entrepreneurship. It supports agri-business  
incubation by encouraging innovations and technologies for value chain development in  
agriculture. In addition, it provides grants to the existing institutional agri-business incubators  
on a need basis. Nearly 10% of the annual outlay under RKVY is earmarked for encouraging  
innovation and agri-entrepreneurs. Additionally, under the flexi-funds component, states can  
support projects as per their local needs, preferably for innovative activities in agriculture and  
allied sectors. The scheme also promotes coordination of ICAR/ SAUs with private players for  
providing improved varieties of seeds/ seedlings and introducing innovative technologies. RKVY-  
RAFTAAR is also supporting the UPJA 2020 program by PUSA Krishi which offers grant in aid of  
up to Rs 25 lakh to the start-ups and also provides mentoring support for developing industry  
connects and piloting the initiative.

Currently, agri-incubators are driving agri-tech sector in India. The new start-ups and ventures  
are offering range of technology driven services including, personalised advisory, early warning  
crop protection, decision support systems through analytics, input-supply, aggregation, tech-  
support, logistics, affordable infrastructure, precision agriculture and irrigation services, credit,  
value addition and marketing etc. Thus, catering to the entire agriculture value chain. Many are  
engaging with farmer groups, FPOs and micro-entrepreneurs. They are also connecting farmers  
and groups to institutional buyers who procure agricultural produce for processing, value  
addition and self-consumption.

Farming in India needs to shift from one size fits all approach, and go for a flexible region specific  
precision agriculture. Agri-tech firms can help in creating this awareness by promoting resource  
efficient site-specific farming practices. This will help in reducing productivity losses and  
encourage efficient utilisation of farm inputs thereby optimizing cost of production. Private sector  
can also help in developing ‘farm to fork’ value chain by providing integrated services, on demand  
integrated infrastructure and marketing support. This will help in mitigating risks of sudden  
price fall during a good harvest.

The growth of start-ups provides an opportunity for the sector, they can be utilised for technical  
support and development of programme implementation. Many emerging start-ups and agri-tech  
firms have technical expertise and can provide range of services that can complement existing  
schemes and fill gaps. They can be engaged for advisory and extension services, input supply and  
production of key inputs, farmer mobilisation, logistic supply, tech support, logistics, post-harvest  
solutions for food losses and development of farm-gate low cost infrastructure.

The engagement of agri-tech firms and involvement will help in technology transfer, this will also  
enable and motivate private players to come forward in sectoral growth and make agricultural  
more profitable.

Apart from FPOs and agri-tech startups, the impact and role of private players has been  
highlighted in scheme level analysis, for example, the role Participatory Irrigation Management  
and Water User Associations and Private Public Partnership Model in Integrated Micro Irrigation  
has been described in-detail for PMKSY-PDMC.

However, it is important to note that the current set of schemes do not have sufficient provisions  
for private sector engagement for research, implementation and collaboration. Most of the  
interventions are being implemented through state departments or government agencies, only  
few scheme components support engagement with entrepreneurs or FPOs.

### 1.3 Issues and Challenges

**Food Security Concerns** : Agriculture in India contributes significantly to the economy of the  
country. India is world largest producer of milk, pulses, and spices, and has the world’s largest  
cattle herd (buffaloes), as well as owns the largest area under wheat, rice and cotton, making the  
nation a global agricultural powerhouse. However, global benchmarking of most agricultural  
commodities bring out the issue of low  
productivity of agricultural produce in  
India. As depicted in the figure given  
alongside the rank of India in yield rate  
is much poor although it happens to be  
one of the top producers of the  
agricultural commodities across the  
globe. Raising the productivity of  
agricultural commodities per unit of  
land have remained one of the top  
concerns in the sector and all  
agricultural policy framed since 1960  
have been taking measures to address  
it. The low yield rate is attributed to  
the low level of mechanization in  
agriculture coupled with large  
sections of rural population resorting  
to subsistence farming. Despite its  
continuous endeavour to attain self-  
sufficiency in crop production, India  
has to import significant amount of  
wheat and is still a net importer of vegetable oil.

**Slow Growth in Farmers’ Income:** Income of farmers has been one of the major challenges in  
this sector leading to a constant decrease in the agricultural labour over the years. As per the  
current trend in income of farmers over the last decade it is evident the growth rate has not been  
consistently growing over the period. While farmers’ income declined at 0.55% per annum  
between 1999–2000 and 2004–05, it increased at 7. 46 % per annum during the period between  
2004 – 05 and 2011-12. The growth rate of farmers’ income between 2004–05 and 2011– 12 has  
been observed to be the highest since the beginning of economic reforms.^86

Table 19 : Growth Rate of Farmers Income

    Time Period Growth Rate
    1993 - 94 to 1999- 00 4.11%
    1999 - 00 to 2004- 05 - 0.55%
    2004 - 05 to 2011- 12 7.46%
    2011 - 12 to 2016- 17 0.44%
    

However, as discussed in the Doubling Farmers’ Income Report, the ambitious target of doubling  
farmers income by 2022-23 would require farm income growth rate of 10.4 per cent per year for

    the nation.^87 The farmer’s income from farm and non-farm activities is pegged at Rs 96,703 per
    annum as of 2015-16. The targeted income of farmers from farm and non-farm activities is
    aspired to be Rs 172694 as of 2022-23 (in 2015-16 prices)^88 and this can be possible only with
    an accelerated growth rate of farmers’ income consistently over the period. The farmer’s income
    which consists of farm activities and non-farm activities is estimated to grow at 10.36% per
    annum and 5.66% per annum respectively during the period 2015-16 and 2022-23. However,
    wages from non-farm activities have been observed to be declining sharply in the recent years.
    As analysed from the Labour Bureau series, Wage Rates in Rural India (WRRI), shows that the
    wage rate had been increasing until 2012–13, post which it has been decelerating and has
    declined in real terms for both agricultural and non-agricultural labourers.^89 Real wages of
    agricultural labourers have declined at 0.3% per annum between 2013 and 2017, whereas non-
    agricultural wages have declined by 1.1% during the same period. This trend has been a
    bottleneck for the revival of farmer’s income in recent years.
    Lack of Agricultural Credit: The rural economy has slumped post 2014-15 with the growth rate
    of agriculture^90 declining to 1.86% between 2014-15 and 2017-18 as against a comparatively
    stronger growth of 3.5% per annum between 2011-12 and 2013-14 as shown in the table below.

    investment. The trend of growth rate in agriculture credit has been depicted in the figure shown

nominal terms between 2004–05 and 2014–15. The lack of access to credit has negatively  
impacted the agriculture sector which direly needs investment on mechanization of agricultural  
operations and the shifting cropping pattern towards high value agriculture which includes  
farming of cash crops and horticulture. Availability of farm credit is one of the key components to  
enable increase in productivity through ensuring substantive investment in irrigation, seeds and  
fertilizers and new technology. Development of post-harvest infrastructure and value addition in  
agrarian activities also requires monetization and hence is likely to be affected due to the gradual  
declining trend in agricultural credit.

Distribution of agricultural credit is also observed to be highly skewed across different states. The  
regional distribution of agricultural credit disbursement is shown in the figure below.

Figure 96 : Percentage of Agricultural Credit Disbursement (till September 2018)

Source: Economic Survey 2019-20, Chapter 07 Agriculture and Food Management

As it can be seen from the figure above, the distribution of agricultural credit is low in North  
Eastern, Hilly and Eastern States. The share of North Eastern States has been less than one per  
cent in total agricultural credit disbursement.^91

**Water Reduction and Irrigation Strengthening:** India accounts for only about 4 per cent of  
global water resources, but supports 18 per cent of the World’s human population. India’s per  
capita water availability is steadily declining due to population growth. According to estimates of  
Doubling Farmer’s Income report, India will be a water stressed country^92 on the basis of per  
capita water availability in 2050 with only 686 cubic meter per year^93. Water required for  
irrigation purpose is estimated at around 75-85 per cent share in the total demand by the  
Standing Sub-Committee of MoWR.

(^91) Economic Survey 2019-20, Chapter 07 Agriculture and Food Management  
(^92) Per capita per year availability of less than 1700 cubic metres (m3) is termed as water stressed condition  
while if it falls below 1000 cubic meters, it is termed as water scarcity condition. (Doubling Farmers’ Income –

With over 80% of the total water in the country being used in agriculture, measures need to be  
taken for sustainable usage.

The vulnerability of crop production due to water stress is also aggravated by the high  
dependence of the country’s agriculture land on rainfall. Around 52% of India’s cultivated land is  
dependent on monsoon rains. The rainfed areas constitute about three fourth of land mass under  
arid, semi-arid, and dry humid situations and are characterized by low levels of productivity and  
low input usage. The variations in rainfall and water availability in different parts of the country  
proves to be a problem for region-specific water scarcity. While average annual rainfall of the  
country is about 1,170 mm, it varies from an average high of 10,000 mm per year in North East  
and a low of just 100 mm per annum in some parts of Western Rajasthan. The Ganga-  
Brahmaputra river basin contributes to more than 50 per cent of total annual water availability,  
whereas, Southern and Western basins account for only about 15% each.^94

There is also sub-optimal utilization of irrigation in the country. Inadequate maintenance of canal  
system, lack of participatory management, changing land use pattern, deviation from the  
designated cropping pattern, soil degradation and delay in command area development attribute  
to the issue of under-utilization of irrigation potential. While there is around 35%-40% of overuse  
in surface irrigation systems, and 65 per cent in case of ground water use, water efficient  
irrigation like micro irrigation has not penetrated in many parts of the country.

The issue of water availability in agriculture is aggravated owing to the current cropping system  
in the country. High proportion of cultivated area under water intensive crops like rice, sugarcane  
etc. is not well managed through water efficient irrigation systems. Diversification from rice and  
sugarcane to low duty crops such as millets, maize, pulses and oilseeds are not opted by farmers.  
There is lack of promotion of low water duty crops like maize, pulses & oilseeds replacing rice,  
sugarcane, banana, cotton etc. especially in over-exploited regions. As per assessment of Central  
Ground Water Board, the over-exploited regions are significantly higher in Delhi, Haryana,  
Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.^95 There is lack  
of awareness generation among farmers on proper use of irrigation water at critical stages of crop  
growth under different soil and environment conditions.

**Problem of Pests and Diseases** : One of the main threats to agriculture are from pests and  
diseases that destroy crops. In India, the farmer’s crop yield losses range from 15 to 25 per cent

94  
95 NITI^ Aayog. 2017. Doubling Farmers’ Income –^ Volume VII, Chapter 2^

    91
    

owing to the presence of weeds, pests, diseases and rodents. Although India uses an average of  
0.5 kg per ha of pesticide (which is much lower compared to USA, South Korea, Japan or Europe),  
within the country there are wide variations between regions, crops and across irrigated-rainfed  
status. The intensity of pesticide usage is high in case of certain crops, particularly when raised  
in irrigated systems.^96 High usage of chemical pesticides also impacts health and safety of other  
flora and fauna, including humans which needs to be replaced with organic solutions to prevent  
diseases. Sale of spurious and misbranded pesticides is one of the biggest challenges faced by the  
agriculture community posing danger to the crop, human health and environment. Lack of  
monitoring of bio-pesticide registrations and lack of comprehensive data on dealers and  
pesticides being sold in the market are some of the underlying reasons of the problem. In addition  
there is need to sensitize farmers adequately along with increasing the reach of Integrated Pest  
Management techniques. There is lack of effective pest surveillance mechanism in Integrated Pest  
Management and in adequate availability of IPM inputs like bio-control agents, bio-pesticides,  
light traps, rodent traps, pheromone traps, sticky traps, seed treatment drums etc. which needs  
to be addressed. The price of pesticides (both branded and generic) is uncontrolled and is  
observed to be increasing affecting the cost incurred by farmers.

**Low Level of Farm Mechanization:** Farm mechanization helps in efficient utilization of all farm  
inputs like seeds, fertilizer and water, thus increasing the productivity of land and labour. It also  
helps in cost minimization by arresting the rising wages of labour being used in the farm.  
Agricultural mechanization mitigates farm drudgery, increases the pace of work at farm and aids  
in enhancing farmers’ income. In India, lack of access to farm power is one of the primary reasons  
for slow uptake of farm mechanization, particularly among small and marginal farmers. Farm  
mechanization is varied across different states. The level of farm mechanization is high at about  
40%-45% in states like UP, Haryana and Punjab, but extremely low in north-eastern and hilly  
states^97. The level of farm mechanization in India is still low as compared to the countries such as  
the U. S. (95 %), Brazil (75%) and China (57%). The percentage of agricultural workers in total  
work force is expected to drop to 25.7% by 2050 from 58.2% in 2001 and farm mechanization  
can be the solution to address this challenge. As highlighted earlier, agricultural mechanization  
demands supply of farm power which is currently a challenge in Indian context. The available  
farm power is 2.02 kW/Ha as of 2016- 1798 which is still low to introduce tractors and power  
tillers. Availability of credit for power tillers and tractors also pose a critical issue. The procedure  
to avail agriculture term loan is known to be cumbersome and the rate of interest is higher for  
farm mechanization based loans^99.

**Lower Adoption of Good Agricultural Practices** : The concept of Good Agricultural Practices in  
agriculture has emerged as a solution catering to the challenges of improving food security,  
manage increasing demand and conserve the natural resources. A GAP approach intends to  
address the demand-side priorities of consumers and retailers, as well as the supply-side  
priorities of producers and labourers. In the era of declining factor productivity and degradation  
of natural resource base of agricultural production system, there is an urgent need to develop

India Good Agricultural Practices (INDGAP) certification scheme has been developed by Quality  
Council of India. INDGAP aims to cover small and marginal farmers and enable them to adopt in  
a phased manner. The Indian Good Agricultural Practices (INDGAP) takes into account not only  
the quality and quantity of the produce obtained from a unit area but also the care is taken in  
integrating preharvest practices like soil & water management, nutrient management and pest  
management, harvesting, post-harvest handling and other logistics. INDGAP has been  
implemented in harvesting rice, zero-till wheat and other crops. However, there are several  
challenges in implementing Good Agricultural Practices in aspects such as seed and sowing, seed  
priming, precision planting techniques, and using improved farm machinery. Studies have  
revealed lack of awareness about critical GAPs among farmers^100.

**Post-Harvest Losses and Challenges of Infrastructure** : One of the growing challenges in the  
agriculture sector is the problem of food loss and food waste. Reducing food loss and waste is the  
key to reduce production costs, increase the efficiency of the food system, improve food security  
and nutrition, and contribute towards environmental sustainability. Globally around 14 percent  
of the world’s food is lost from the post-harvest stage up to, excluding, the retail stage. In Central  
and Southern Asia, the percentage of food loss is as high as 20%-21%.^101

The need for warehousing and cold chain development is a critical step for prevention of post-  
harvest losses. Inadequate storage conditions, and climatic factors like heat and moisture cause  
biological deterioration especially without proper storage and transportation. In India, loss of  
perishable food items like fruits and vegetables, meat and fish are attributable to poor  
infrastructure and in adequate cold storage facilities. According to Global Cold Chain Alliance^102 ,  
India has an average of 0.34 cubic meters of refrigerated warehousing space per urban resident  
and is in the 8th place globally as of 2018^103. This indicates there is potential to improve cold chain  
infrastructure in the country in order to handle its agricultural produce better.

**Challenges in Food Processing** : Contribution of agriculture to the economy can be enhanced by  
improving the food processing industry. High production level of agricultural inputs provide  
immense opportunity to improve its processing sector and at the same time create employment  
opportunities as well. India currently processes less than 10%^104 of its agricultural output (only  
around 2% of fruits and vegetables, 6% of poultry, 21% of meat, 23% of marine and 35% of milk)  
and most of the processing that is done in India can be classified as primary processing – done  
through rice, sugar, edible oil and flour mills etc. Primary processing offers lower value-addition  
compared to secondary processing that includes processing of high value items viz fruits and  
vegetables, dairy, bakery, meat and fish items etc. Despite being the second largest producer of  
the fruits and vegetables in the world, the processing levels in fruits and vegetables currently  
stand at a low of 2%. The current processing levels in poultry are 6%, while for meat it stands at  
21%. With scope of improving exports in the processing sector, this industry also needs to  
standardise the mandatory requirements of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures^105 to ensure  
quality control and food safety. Agricultural exports from the country often face bans due to non-

compliance of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. Food processing levels vary significantly  
across states of India. Southern region has the highest numbers of registered factories with  
Andhra Pradesh accounting for about 14.75% followed by Tamil Nadu accounting for about  
12.77% and Telangana accounting for about 9.99% of the total registered factories. There is much  
lower penetration of FPI industries in Eastern states. In terms of the equipment of processing,  
there is a huge deficit of pack houses at the farm gate, cold storage facilities across the value chain,  
multi - modal logistics, government certified labs and mechanised handling and loading. The  
sector is also affected by the lack of demand-based innovations as well as efficient and reliable  
marketing networks.

**Issues in Agricultural Marketing:** An efficient agricultural marketing system ensures  
transparent price discovery maintaining operational efficiency resulting in proper remuneration  
to the farmers as well as offer affordable rates to consumers. Extent of price dispersion for the  
same produce, across multiple markets in the country is indicative of the efficacy of the  
agricultural marketing system. As discussed in Figure, farm gate price dispersion is found to be  
high among all crops in India, especially among perishable crops like potato, onion and  
groundnuts. The variation in prices between farm-gate and consumer is attributed to factors like  
lack of logistics connecting farm-gate with the wholesale market at consumer end, connectivity,  
degree of private sector competition, propensity of regional exposure to shocks, local storage  
capacity, mandi infrastructure and farmers access to them, storage life of the crop and crop  
specific processing cost^106. There is lack of market intelligence system that monitors and analysis  
other economic signal for the purpose of marketing efficiency. Some of the key policy instruments  
that have been adopted to streamline marketing system includes regulation of markets through  
the APMC Act, input subsidies for producers, minimum support prices (MSP), and food subsidies  
for consumers. However, the current APMC Act has several shortcomings in terms of prohibitive  
license fee, high commission, marketing fee, and APMC cess levied to farmers. The penetration of  
agricultural markets varies across states with the density of regulated markets being 118 sq km.  
in Punjab to 11,214 sq km. in Meghalaya. The current regulated markets lack most of the essential  
marketing infrastructure such as auction platforms, common drying yards, electronic weigh-  
bridges, grading facilities and cold storage units. While covered and open auction platforms exist  
only in two-thirds of the regulated markets, only one-fourth of the markets have common drying  
yards, one-tenth of the markets have cold storage units and grading facilities are there in less than  
one-third of the markets^107. The current agricultural marketing system lacks efficient supply  
chain having large number of marketing channels and adding up more of costs without adding  
significant value. Lack of developed alternative marketing channels like direct marketing,  
contract farming has resulted in low farmer’s price realization. Reforms in the agricultural  
marketing system is hence required to build an efficient and robust marketing system.

**Gaps in Research and Development** : Green Revolution-I sought to bring food security to the  
nation. The next revolution, Green Revolution-II was launched to ensure income security of the  
farmers by applying science and technology to all sub-sectors of agriculture such as agriculture,  
horticulture, dairy & livestock, fishery and aquaculture. Research and development in agriculture  
requires to focus on income-guided ventures to ensure applicability of the interventions. Some of  
the domains in agriculture that lack research gaps are irrigated ecosystems, hill agriculture,  
coastal agriculture, seed production system. There is a wide gap in irrigation potential created  
and its utilisation which needs to be bridged through use of potential technologies such as

breeding water use efficient varieties, adopting water use efficient cropping system (crop  
alignment), water use efficient technologies like micro-irrigation, sensors etc. In rainfed  
agriculture as well, management of natural resources needs to be supported by technology led  
sustainable development systems. Soil and water conservation methods are required to be  
supported by evolution & promotion of appropriate technologies including crop diversification,  
developing crop genotypes, and alternate land use systems. There are gaps in applying modern  
technology in developing improved varieties of crops and hybrids, refinement of seed-production  
technologies and production of breeder seeds. The agriculture sector needs a robust seed  
production system which would address low seed replacement rate, low varietal replacement  
rate, lack of seed grid and seeds resistant to abiotic and biotic stresses. High value agriculture  
crop sector like horticulture is highly dependent on advanced research and development on  
genetic resource enhancement, enhancing the efficiency of production and reducing post-harvest  
losses. Research and developmental gaps exist in respect of effective management, enhancing the  
shelf life of perishable fruits, vegetables, flowers, product diversification and value addition for  
better profitability. Technology and automation is also key to food processing sector to address  
the required levels of quality control, production speed, labor shortages and overall profitability.

Chapter 2 : Sector Level Recommendations: Agriculture

### 2.1 Recommendations at Sectoral Level

Post consultations with the department officials at central, state and district level; sector experts; and  
our analysis of the issues and challenges faced by the agriculture sector, the recommendations and  
solutions have been provided below across the Value Chain.

**Production**

*   Quality seeds, planting material, fertilisers, pesticides, insecticides and bio-fertilisers are  
    critical for sustained production of agriculture and horticulture activities. Non availability of  
    quality seeds has been a major constraint which impact production and yield of key  
    agricultural commodities. Thus, ensuring availability of quality inputs is critical which needs  
    to be addressed. This should be supplemented by capacity building of farmers on various  
    aspects of seed treatment, time of sowing and treatment of soil before sowing, etc. to ensure  
    disease free production of crops. More focus is also necessary on enhancing quality seed  
    production and development of nurseries to ensure timely availability of quality planting  
    materials. Optimal use of fertilizers (including micro-nutrients) and pesticides should also be  
    encouraged based on soil testing before the start of every crop season. Bio-fertilizers and bio-  
    pesticides should be promoted considering the high environmental impacts of chemical  
    fertilizers and pesticides.
*   As mentioned, majority of FPOs (including FPCs) in India are at a nascent stage of their  
    operations. They mostly assist the member farmers in input supply although some are also  
    engaged in aggregation of the produce from the members. However, there is a need to assist  
    the development of these FPOs into a functioning business enterprise. The FPOs may be  
    encouraged to widen their scope of services in the lines of agribusiness centres which should  
    operate as an one stop destination for all the production and marketing needs of the member  
    farmers including sale of agri inputs and services, procurement and primary processing,  
    storage and marketing.

Box 5 : Abhinav's Farmers' Club

*   There is a sub-optimal utilization of irrigation in the country. Adequate maintenance of canal  
    system, participatory management, changing land use pattern, following the designated  
    cropping pattern, reduction of soil degradation and timely command area development  
    would increase the utilization of irrigation potential. Promotion of water efficient irrigation  
    such as micro irrigation should be actively promoted especially in the water scarce areas.
*   As discussed earlier, the issue of water availability in agriculture is aggravated owing to the  
    current cropping system in the country. High proportion of cultivated area under water  
    intensive crops like rice, sugarcane etc. is not well managed through water efficient irrigation  
    systems. Diversification from rice and sugarcane to crops such as millets, maize, pulses and

    Abhinav Farmers’ Club
    A group of 12 progressive farmers formed the Abhinav Farmers’ Club in Pune
    district of Maharashtra under the guidance of National Bank for Rural Development
    (NABARD), in the year 2004. These farmers were involved in cultivation of roses
    and carnations under protected conditions of a poly house. The Farmers’ Club
    enabled the individual farmers to aggregate the produce and market it effectively in
    Mumbai and Delhi. The functions of production, logistics, marketing, branding were
    divided among the different members of the group. Gradually more farmers started
    becoming members of the club and the membership grew to more than 300.
    However, all the member farmers practiced floriculture, which resulted in excess
    supply and eventually led to reduced margins for the member farmers.
    Abhinav Farmers’ Club then developed an innovative 1-acre hi-tech integrated
    organic farming concept, in which the farmers would grow different types of fruits,
    leafy vegetables, exotic vegetables and pulses. Abhinav Farmers’ Club has also tied
    up with women Self Help Groups, who help in grading, packaging and delivery of
    the produce at the doorstep of the consumers. This is an integrated model, which
    focuses on growing a diverse set of products (in smaller quantities) needed every-
    day by the consumers and supplying them directly to the end-consumers. The USP
    of this model is that the high quality organic produce is directly marketed to the
    retail consumers, thereby eliminating all the intermediaries. This ensures higher
    margins to the member farmers.
    The current membership of Abhinav Farmers’ Club is not just limited to Pune, but
    has spread to six states of the country, viz. Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra
    Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. The total membership is close to
    1.5 lakh farmers, who produce organic fruits, vegetables, pulses on a 1-acre plot
    each and directly supply to end consumers. The coordination amongst these
    member farmers is facilitated through farmer leaders from each group (257 farmer
    leaders across the country), which are connected through a WhatsApp group and
    meet once in three months. Abhinav Farmers’ Club provides the technical expertise
    regarding production and marketing of the produce to the new member farmers
    through the farmers’ leaders. Thus, it has been able to reach a membership of
    around 1.5 lakh farmers.

    oilseeds are recommended considering the low water requirement of the later crops. Low
    water consuming crops such as maize, pulses & oilseeds should be promoted replacing rice,
    sugarcane, banana, cotton etc. in over-exploited regions.
    

*   Awareness generation among farmers on proper use of irrigation water at critical stages of  
    crop growth under different soil and environment conditions should be undertaken.
*   In India, there has been slow  
    uptake of farm mechanization,  
    particularly among small and  
    marginal farmers. Considering the  
    expected drop of percentage of  
    agricultural workers in total work  
    force in India, it is critical that farm  
    mechanization is actively  
    promoted. Considering the cost  
    involved in farm mechanization, it  
    is recommended that the FPOs can  
    also be promoted as equipment  
    banks which would enable small  
    and marginal farmers to have  
    access to such equipment at a low  
    cost. Moreover, the private sector  
    can be roped in for provision of  
    such services. Innovative business  
    models such as digital sharing  
    platforms of farm equipment (Uber  
    model) may be promoted. This will  
    not only provide easy access to  
    farm equipment for the smaller farmers but would also increase the utilization of equipment  
    owned by the farmers when not being used in their own farms.

**Processing and Value Addition**

*   Upgradation of Storage and Transparent Price Discovery Infrastructure at Mandi level can  
    assist in processing, value addition and marketing. There is a need to upgrade and promote  
    modern dry storage to cater to various agricultural crops linked with the warehouse receipt  
    financing facility. This would enable the smallholder farmers to store their produce and take  
    advantage of the increased rates after few months of the harvest season. This would prevent  
    the distress selling and help them get better gains from the market. Also, due to the  
    warehouse receipt facility the farmers would be able to avail loans at affordable rates for their  
    different financial needs.
*   In case of most crops, the prices are determined by the moisture and foreign material content  
    and oil content in oilseeds. However, scientific testing facilities are mostly not available at the  
    markets and the traders rely on visual methods and physical handling to estimate the

    The total market size of agri-machinery
    renting is stated to be over $5 billion, while
    the total agriculture market size is over $250

    The players in this market include EM3
    Agribusiness, Zamindara farm solutions,
    Trringo and government cooperatives.
    EM3 buys their own machinery and leases it,
    with around 15 centres in MP, east UP and
    Bihar. Zamindara also follows a similar model
    as EM3 and operates in a few locations in
    Punjab.
    Trringo is a Mahindra (M&M) internally
    incubated startup and has a twin business
    model - franchise and farmer to farmer.

    moisture, foreign material and oil content. Thus, the price discovery mechanisms are skewed
    in favor of the traders and the farmers end up getting less price for their produce. Thus, in
    order to promote transparent price discovery, it is recommended that enabling
    infrastructure in the form of Cleaning Grading Machines, Moisture Meters, Oil Content
    Analyzer, etc. are established in major markets. For instance, in case of milk, dairy farmers
    are able to get fair price realization through milko-testers installed at the point of sale and
    the process is transparent. It is proposed to create such transparent price discovery
    infrastructure in major agricultural produce markets in the country.
    

*   Similarly, grading machines can be installed for horticultural products. After grading and  
    sorting, the table grades can be transported to the retail markets/ retailers and processing  
    grade can be moved to processing centres.
*   Moreover, irradiation facilities can also be established to increase the shelf life of both grains,  
    pulses and some of the horticulture crops to reduce/ eliminate storage pests.
*   Encourage appropriate/ innovative packaging (for instance, modified atmosphere packaging,  
    biodegradable packaging, etc.) to minimize losses.
*   Capacity building of farmers and farmer collectives on improved harvest and post-harvest  
    practices. For example, in the case of Bananas, farmers need to be trained on the use of foam  
    padding/ bubble wraps to prevent injury to the harvested banana bunch. Similarly, the hands  
    need to be dipped in alum solution for prevention of sap flow on the peels to prevent black  
    spots. Similarly, farmers need to be trained on appropriate harvesting and post-harvesting  
    practices such as optimal time of harvest, storage temperature, quality indices, maturity  
    indices, injuries, handling protocols, post-harvest injuries and decays, ripening process and  
    use of ripening agents, use of right packaging, transportation impact etc. for other crops as  
    well for better value realization and reducing damage to the produce.

Box 7: Use of Nets for harvesting fruits

    Use of Nets for harvesting fruits
    Majority of the mango growers do not use the mango harvester to harvest the
    fruits. The fruits are harvested by beating the branches with bamboo poles or
    climbing the tree and vigorously shaking the branches, making the fruits fall
    onto the ground. As a result, barring the fruits, which are on lower branches,
    the other fruits are either bruised or damaged during the harvesting process.
    Such practices result in direct/indirect wastage of almost 10%-15% of the
    fruits, when compared to the harvesting done by adopting scientific harvesting
    practices.
    One reason cited for not using the mango harvester is that, the process is
    time consuming and requires more labor to do it. Considering this, nets can
    be used under the canopy of the trees, so that the fruits are collected in them
    and the physical injury to the fruits is prevented. This practice can be
    promoted as a better harvesting practice among the farmers.
    

    99
    

**Credit and Insurance**

*   Access to finance and Creation of Seed Capital/ Venture Capital Fund. Availability of timely  
    credit (both term loans and working capital) from banks and other financial institutions is a  
    major challenge. The majority of banks and other financial institutions generally seek a  
    minimum collateral of about 150% to 200% of loan value from the farmers/ farmer  
    collectives/ enterprises/ start-ups. Moreover, difficulty in accessing working capital loan,  
    many times forces the farmer to avail loans from informal sources, which typically involves  
    high costs. For e.g., the potato farmers are primarily dependent on cold storage owners for  
    informal credits, as access to formal credits is limited and warehouse receipt financing  
    facility is mostly not available. These informal loans are provided at 18% to 24% per annum  
    depending upon the mutual understanding and negotiation between the farmer and the cold  
    storage owner.
*   Moreover, most of the Government Subsidy Schemes are credit linked, such as Cold Chain  
    Scheme, Scheme for Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages and Scheme for Creation/  
    Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities (Ministry of Food Processing  
    Industries) term loan of a certain percentage of the project cost is a mandatory eligibility  
    criterion. Many of the farmer collectives and other smaller agribusiness companies are  
    unable to apply under these subsidy schemes for creation of processing, storage and value  
    addition infrastructure due to their inability to raise bank loans. Considering this, it is  
    recommended that the government may consider creating agri-business/ agri-processing  
    fund which provided soft loans (both term and working capital) at 4-5% interest rates to  
    farmer collectives and agri-business private companies.
*   The agri-enterprises (especially the start-ups) which are operating and planning to operate  
    have an acute need for seed / venture capital along with business/ enterprise incubation.  
    Some of the existing funding and incubation programs have been quite successful in the state.  
    For e.g., the INVENT programme has received encouraging response and several agri-  
    startups have been funded and incubated under this programme. Also, recently India  
    Agritech Incubation Network has been setup at IIT-Kanpur with a target to impact almost  
    50,000 farmers through 60 enterprises working on technological solutions for agriculture.  
    There is need for such seed/ venture capital along with business/ enterprise incubation to  
    provide a supportive environment to improve their business, entrepreneurial and marketing  
    skills along with low cost funding.

    100
    

Box 5 :India Agritech Incubation Network

*   Agricultural/ Crop Insurance has not taken off as envisaged. There have been multiple issues  
    including high premium,  
    limited coverage of crops,  
    limited percolation  
    geography – higher in South  
    India vs North and East  
    India, limited interest of  
    insurance service  
    providers, etc. Horticultural  
    crops typically have been  
    excluded from PMFBY.  
    Thus, there is a need to  
    enhance the scope of  
    insurance to cover all crops including horticultural, plantations and spice crops. For instance,  
    in Uttar Pradesh, the cultivation area of Betel Leaf is roughly 1,000 hectares and the rain has  
    destroyed 80% of the crop. However, Betel Leaf farming is considered as horticulture crop  
    and not as agriculture and crop insurance does not cover it. Therefore, farmers in the state  
    engaged in Betel Leaf farming have suffered heavy losses^107.
*   Moreover, the risk has increased for private insurance companies because the number of  
    farmers covered under the scheme has not increased over the years. In 2016-17, more than

    India Agritech Incubation Network
    Recently, India Agritech Incubation Network (IAIN) has been setup at IIT-Kanpur with a
    target to impact almost 50,000 farmers through 60 enterprises working on technological
    solutions for agriculture. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and Tata Trusts, in
    collaboration with Collectives for Integrated Livelihood Initiatives (CInI) and the
    Government of Uttar Pradesh, have jointly set up the IAIN. It aims to provide incubation
    support to innovators and agritech entrepreneurs, to come up with innovative technological
    solutions to positively impact the lives of smallholder farmers in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
    Under this initiative, the Social Alpha Quest for Agritech Innovations has been announced in
    July 2019. In the first phase, around 12 innovations are proposed to be selected, which
    would receive incubation support for the next 1-2 years. The initiative would aim to bring
    about new technological innovations in the following areas:
    

*   Improving productivity and yield intensification
*   Better post-harvest loss management and value-addition
*   Enhancing access to market and improving traceability

    58 million farmers were covered under the scheme, which dropped to around 56 million in
    2018 - 19. This has pushed the scheme’s premium as can be seen from the figure alongside.
    The interest of private players is diminishing in the scheme due to high risks and this can
    weaken the overall efforts. This may also increase the risk burden of the government
    companies (already 5 government-run companies under the scheme cover over 50% of the
    disaster-prone areas) and the
    overall claim ratio of the
    government companies in the past
    three years have been substantially
    higher (86%) than the private
    players (77%). In case, the
    remaining players also increase the
    premium amount to compensate
    for the higher risk, it may make farmers unsure of the benefits from crop insurance scheme^108.
    Therefore, the number of farmers under the scheme need to be increased to cover the entire
    country for long-term sustainability of the scheme.
    

*   There is a need to revisit both the contours of the scheme and its implementation in its  
    current form. It is proposed that the scope of crop insurance be widened to cover potential  
    crop income/ livelihood rather than just crop inputs. It may also be considered to focus on  
    providing insurance to collectives for more widespread coverage and reduced operational  
    expenditure of service providers.

**Marketing**

*   There is need to encourage market development through initiatives such as promotion of  
    digital e-market places, direct linkages with emerging agribusiness markets/ private players,  
    export promotion, etc.
*   Emerging agribusiness players and exporters need to be supported in developing market  
    linkages or connecting with buyers in the international market and in turn benefiting the  
    farmers. Therefore, such private sector agri-businesses which need critical support for  
    enhancing marketing and promotion of their produce in both domestic and export markets,  
    are suggested to be supported for availing professional services for these activities provided

*   Effective marketing linkages for farmer collectives including branding need to be developed.  
    As mentioned earlier, the major constraint faced by the farmers and their collectives is the  
    lack of effective market linkages. As a result, the farmer collectives are not able to get better  
    price realization for the produce. The farmer collectives can be provided handholding  
    support to develop market linkages with agribusiness companies, modern retailers,  
    processors and exporters.
*   Different brands can be developed for the focus crops based on the geographical specialties,  
    along with appropriate and attractive packaging. GI indicators based marketing can be  
    promoted for higher value creation (e.g. Malihabadi Mangoes, Banarasi Langda, Govind Bhog  
    Rice, Bydagi Chillies, etc.).

    Case Study: Hort Innovation (Australia)
    Background: Hort Innovation is grower-owned, not-for-profit research and development
    corporation for Australia's horticulture industry. Each year, investment of more than $100
    million in R&D, marketing and trade programs is made on behalf of industry to improve
    the productivity, farm gate profitability and global competitiveness of specific industries,
    and Australian horticulture as a whole.
    Funding: Hort Innovation's investments are funded by grower levies and Australian
    Government contributions, as well other industry contributions and co-investment.
    Industry Insights : For investments in R&D, marketing and trade, Hort Innovation
    consults with growers through industry-specific Strategic Investment Advisory Panels.

*   There is an urgent need for training on e-marketplaces/ auctions and other digital marketing  
    services. Incentives can be provided to buyer and sellers who would trade through e-market  
    place such as e-NAM to encourage and popularize the usage of e-trading platform. Such  
    awareness generation initiatives should be undertaken by the State Governments as well.

**Research and Development**

*   To promote innovations, it is proposed to create an R&D fund to develop innovative  
    solutions/ technologies for post-harvest management and develop commercial models for  
    such innovations. The Government needs to encourage innovation and collaboration in the  
    sector with a fund available for R&D projects that will help the sector remain profitable and  
    sustainable into the future. The fund should enable industry to partner with research  
    organizations on projects that use new technologies and techniques for improving overall  
    economic performance. The projects funded by the fund should include applied R&D that is  
    innovative and likely to improve farm performance and that will improve market access/  
    business diversification.
*   Leading research institutions/ organizations can be engaged for such R&D. Collaborations  
    with foreign universities/ research organizations may also be encouraged. Development of  
    innovations such as low-cost solar/ biomass powered small pre-coolers and cold storages at  
    the farm level, packaging based on bio-polymers derived from renewable sources, low cost  
    ethylene dispensers for uniform and healthy ripening of fruits, and advanced modified  
    atmosphere packaging etc. can be encouraged.

**Policy Level Interventions**

*   It is important to note that the despite the increase in agricultural production, the overall  
    contribution of agriculture and allied sector in overall GVA has been consistently declining  
    since 2012-13. This diminishing trend is a concern as agriculture still is the primary source  
    of livelihood for more than 58% HHs in rural India and provides employment to 43.9% of  
    country’s total workforce. However, with reducing economic importance of agriculture, more  
    people are shifting away from agriculture as the total share of employment in agriculture has  
    declined from 51.1% in 2010 to 43.9% in 2018. One of the primary reasons towards this shift  
    may be attributed to increasing cost of production and wide gap between farm-gate price and  
    consumer prices, as only a small share of consumer price reaches farmers^109. One of the other  
    fallouts of reduced income from agriculture has been outmigration to urban and peri-urban  
    areas which has led to unplanned urbanization and associated socio-economic issues.  
    Considering this, there is an urgent need to make agriculture more viable through specific  
    policy interventions.
*   The budgeted estimates for umbrella scheme (including PMKSY-PDMC) has increased from  
    about Rs. 14924 Crores in 2016-17 to about Rs. 17930 crores in 2018-19. However, in all the  
    years, the budget estimates have been reduced by about 17% in revised estimates. In 2019-  
    20 , the BE has reduced by about 10.32% from that of 2018-19.

    104
    

*   The reduction in BE for umbrella scheme between 2018-19 and 2019-20 is in contrast to the  
    trend in allocation for central sector schemes/projects. The BE for key Central Sector  
    Schemes/projects for DACFW^110 has increased by more than three times from Rs. 28200 in  
    2018 - 19 to Rs. 1.138 lakh crores in 2019- 20. This increase is mainly driven by budget  
    allocation of Rs 75,000 crores towards Income Support Scheme. In addition to the Income  
    Support Scheme, the interest subsidy for short term credit to farmers (Rs 18,000 crores) and  
    Crop Insurance Scheme (Rs 14,000 crores) are other major components of budgeted  
    expenditure for DACFW.
*   Given the diversity and range of challenges that the agriculture sector faces today in India viz.  
    increasing production cost, depleting ground water resources, reducing availability of water,  
    declining soil quality, scarcity of quality agriculture inputs^111 , low productivity, reducing crop  
    diversity, climate change, increasing land degradation and most importantly low price  
    realisation to farmers^112. The interventions under the umbrella scheme of Green revolution  
    and PMKSY can help in overcoming these challenges. Therefore, it is critical to give high  
    importance to the umbrella schemes as well for achieving sustainable livelihood growth in  
    rural areas.
*   It has been observed that many times that the schemes are unable to perform as per the  
    expectations due to lack of or delayed contribution of funds by the State Governments. This  
    is mostly due to fiscal situation of the State Governments and their own development  
    priorities. Considering this, it is recommended that some of the major schemes (or specific  
    components of the schemes) which are critical for the growth of the sector may be funded as  
    Central Sector Schemes.
*   As mentioned earlier, horticulture contributes more than a third of the agricultural GDP,  
    though it occupies less than a fifth of the cultivated area and is expected to increase further  
    fuelled by high demand for fresh fruits and vegetables. Significant progress has been made in  
    area expansion under horticulture resulting in higher production. Over the last decade, the  
    area under horticulture grew by about 2.6% per annum and annual production increased by  
    4.8%^113. Horticulture is also garnering greater importance as it contributes to nutritional  
    security as well than only food security. A cost-benefit study by ICRIER, has indicated that it  
    is more profitable to cultivate fruits and vegetables than cereals. It is important to generate  
    optimal output and income through reallocation of land, keeping in mind the both food and  
    nutritional security, domestic demand and export opportunities. Diversification to more  
    profitable crops can improve the economic conditions of small and marginal farmers,  
    especially in areas where the profitability of food grain cultivation has reduced. Thus, there  
    is a need to give more focus to the growth of the horticulture sub-sector.

    o However, the focus on production and productivity increase in horticulture has to be
    supplemented by developing appropriate post-harvest infrastructure along the value
    chain. This is particularly important, as various studies have indicated post-harvest
    losses of fruits and vegetables in India are very high- ranging from 4.5% to almost
    about 44% for different fruits and vegetables. The losses are higher in states with
    poor connectivity and infrastructure. As mentioned earlier, there are severe gaps in
    post-harvest infrastructure and logistics in many parts of the country which
    contribute to the post-harvest losses.
    o This also gets exacerbated by the fact that the current production is highly
    fragmented due to lower landholding which does not support individual farm level
    infrastructure. Therefore, it is recommended that a cluster based approach for
    integrated value chain development of horticulture should be adopted as it would
    provide certain economies of scale and lower marginal cost of operations. In this
    approach, the major horticulture production clusters should be identified and linked
    to consumer markets. In the identified clusters, end-to-end value chain development
    should be promoted that would include production/ productivity improvement
    through GAP/ organic cultivation, development of post-harvest infrastructure
    including storage, processing and transportation, assistance in certification and
    developing linkages with the large domestic and export markets.
    

*   There is a need to develop an on-going real time surveillance mechanism linked to early  
    warning systems for crop pests and diseases to take pre-emptive measures. A real-time MIS  
    with open access should be developed which would support the pest and disease control  
    interventions in line with GAP.
*   Enhanced focus needs to be given to develop the farmer collectives into commercially viable  
    business enterprises that would not only engage in production but also set up value addition  
    facilities in terms of pack houses, innovative cold stores and processing facilities at the farm-  
    gate. Thus, the farmer collective enterprises would need professional handholding support  
    for all business aspects like operational, financial and technical services. In activity terms, it  
    would translate into professional expertise for developing business and marketing plans,  
    planning the investment – one time vis a vis phased inflow, market linkages, identification  
    and selection of appropriate technology, partners, linkages, networks and service providers  
    (legal, accounting, secretarial, sales & marketing, finance, human resources, tax planning  
    etc.), leadership training, book keeping, etc. The main objective of these activities would be  
    to develop entrepreneurship in the farmer collectives and helping them run successful  
    enterprise. There would also be a focus on promoting new farmer collectives for the focus  
    crops, based upon the presence/ absence of such collectives in major production clusters of  
    the focus crops.

**Key Recommendations at the Sector Level for Achieving Transformational Improvements Across  
the Value Chain**

*   As mentioned earlier, in India, adoption of GAP is at a nascent stage. There are several  
    challenges in implementing Good Agricultural Practices in aspects such as seed and sowing,

    106
    

    seed priming, precision planting techniques, and using improved farm machinery. Studies
    have revealed lack of awareness of critical GAPs among farmers is very low. There is a need
    to develop a comprehensive crop-wise and agro-climatic zone-wise Package of Practices
    (PoPs) on GAP along with crop specific calendars outlining activities to be undertaken. The
    PoPs should to be widely disseminated using a mix of extension mechanisms and
    information technology (such as online portals, mobile apps, etc.) for ensuring increased
    awareness and adoption by the farmers. Promotion of Public-Private-Community
    Partnership (PPCP) approaches in agricultural extensions can lead to larger coverage of such
    activities. Master trainers from within the farming communities need to be identified and
    trained who would train the other farmers in GAP. This would lead to wider outreach and
    faster adoption.
    

*   Promotion of better and hi-tech farm management practices such as precision farming which  
    can accurately manage variations in the field to increase productivity and optimizing  
    resource use. The field variations and requirements are monitored using information  
    technology and tools such as GPS, sensors, robotics, drones, variable rate technology, GPS-  
    based soil sampling, automated hardware, telematics, etc. These should be promoted on  
    export oriented farms growing high value crops. Some private sector agri companies/  
    startups have already ventured into this space.
*   There is a need to involve private sector participation through innovative mechanisms in  
    development of post-harvest infrastructure including processing. One of the initiatives apart  
    from ongoing schemes on this aspect could be creation of incubation cum product  
    development centres where entrepreneurs can test new product/ value added products  
    without incurring capital expenses on plant and machinery and pilot the products in the  
    market before launching full-fledged commercial operations.
*   There is a need to shift the focus from “traditional and subsistence agriculture” to “market  
    led and export oriented production”. In spite having the second largest agricultural  
    production in the world, India’s share of agricultural export is only 2.2% of the world’s  
    agricultural exports as of 2017. There has been low acceptability of many Indian agricultural  
    products in the international markets due to quality issues and lack of traceability. This can  
    be addressed by promoting GAP and quality-based efficient production systems, traceability  
    and certification, development of modern post-harvest infrastructure and logistics with  
    export market as a target to increase India’s share in the global agricultural products trade.
*   Climate resilient agriculture should be one of the thrust areas. Highly nutritious crops which  
    are native to particular agro-climatic zone should be promoted. For example, millets which  
    are drought resistant to large extent.
*   India accounts for only about 4% of global water resources, but supports 18% of the World’s  
    human population. India’s per capita water availability is constantly steadily declining due  
    to population growth. According to estimates of Doubling Farmer’s Income report, India will  
    be a water stressed country on the basis of per capita water availability in 2050 with only  
    686 cubic meter per year. Water required for irrigation purpose is estimated at around 75-  
    85 per cent share in the total demand by the Standing Sub-Committee of MoWR. With over

    107
    

    80% of the total water in the country being used in agriculture, measures need to be taken
    for sustainable usage. Thus, there is a need for focussed efforts on water conservation in
    agriculture. Interventions such as micro-irrigation (PMKSY-PDMC), etc. needs to be
    supplemented with conservation mechanisms such as mulching, development and
    maintenance of water conservation structures, watershed management, etc. Higher
    allocations should be considered on water conservation efforts/ interventions.
    

*   Technical support groups involving multi-disciplinary team needs to be created for project  
    management, planning and implementation at the central and state level. Fixed term  
    contracts/ tenures for scheme level officials for 3-4 years with yearly performance linked  
    appraisal may be introduced for higher accountability.

Part: B – Animal Husbandry Sector

Chapter 1 : Sector Level Analysis: Animal Husbandry

### 1.2 Performance of the Sector

The Livestock Sector is a significant sub-sector under Agriculture and Allied Sector in terms of its  
economic contribution with a share of 27.4% of Gross Value Added (GVA) in agriculture and allied  
sector (2017-18). The economic activities under this domain covers production of milk, meat, eggs,  
wool, dung, etc.

Driven by the success of Operation Flood launched in 1970, the Livestock Sector has progressed by  
leaps and bounds as India has now become largest producer of milk, 6th largest producer of meat and  
3 rd largest producer of eggs in the world as of 2018^114. Key strengths of the sector includes large and  
increasing population of milch cattle and poultry, presence of relatively disease free/drought  
resistant indigenous livestock species and strong dairy cooperatives chains across top milk producer  
states in India.

Animal Husbandry and Dairying is an integral part of the Indian rural economy. Not only does it  
provide large employment opportunities to landless, small and marginal farmers, it also contributes  
significantly to the food basket by providing nutritious food to millions^115. While the percentage  
contribution of the sector to overall Gross Value Added (GVA) is relatively small (around 4%), it  
contributes significantly in terms of providing livelihood opportunities to the rural households, as  
more than 65 million households in India are engaged in animal farming activities^116 and more than  
73% of rural farming households rear livestock^117.

Major challenges for animal husbandry and dairying sectors include low productivity of animals,  
shortage of feed and fodder, pitiful living conditions of animals, inadequate healthcare, and slow  
dissemination of technology and skills to farmers for improving productivity. The government  
through its various schemes and programmes seek to enhance poultry productivity, milk and meat  
production, for attaining nutritional security, employment generation and economic prosperity for  
the country. The overarching vision of the Department for the sector correlates to enhancement in  
productivity of livestock in a sustainable and profitable manner. It also seeks to develop requisite  
infrastructure for breeding of animals, as well as storage and transportation of their produce.  
Preservation and protection of livestock through provision of healthcare is another thrust area for  
the Department. This may be achieved through improving genetic resources, ensuring livestock and  
poultry health, providing veterinary care, and better management of feed and fodder. Strengthening  
of central livestock farms (cattle, sheep and poultry) for development of superior germ plasm is also  
one of the critical objectives. Further, Private sector participation must be encouraged in to ensure  
better remuneration for farmers. Lastly, enabling easier access to finance is critical for the sector and

thus is one of the key objectives for the sector. A representative illustrative of the sector’s vision is  
given below:

Source: Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying; Deloitte analysis

As observed in the Doubling Farmer’s Income Report - Performance of Agriculture and Allied sector,  
Livestock Sector has never recorded a negative growth rate in the period from 1980 to 2015 which  
included several years of drought as well. This trend has been true for the subsequent years i.e. 2016  
to 2018. The livestock sector demonstrated that it can be relied upon for risk mitigation and  
minimizing the losses for the farmers even in case of worst outcomes from others sub-sectors and is  
likely to emerge as engine of growth of agriculture sector.

As highlighted in figure above, the growth in livestock sector has been highest during 2004-05 to  
2014 - 15. The sector has recorded higher growth rate than some of the major crop categories  
including paddy and wheat, nutri-cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and fruits & vegetables. The remunerative  
prices fetched by farmers led to higher production which has been inferred as the reason behind  
good performance.

Figure 99 : Share of agriculture and allied sectors in Value of Production (%)

Source: Doubling Farmer’s Income Report, Volume 1

With the objective of improving profitability from the agriculture and allied activities and ensure  
farmers’ income security, diversification towards high value agricultural activities like livestock  
rearing activities is needed. Milk contributes to 24% in the value of output and meat contributes up  
to 8% in the value of output^118. The contribution from the animal husbandry and dairy sector is higher  
than contribution from major cereal crops (rice, wheat and maize) which is 20% of the value of  
output. Income from this sector can be further improved by ensuring healthier and quality output  
through implementation of better animal husbandry practices, selection of breeds and focusing on  
safe and secure post-harvest management systems.

While there has been impressive growth, the sector also faces impending challenges such as  
increasing cost of fodder and feed; limited access to feed, fodder and water; inefficient livestock  
markets; low productivity of indigenous cattle; large unproductive cattle population; limited access  
to credit, among others.

The sector analysis covers important livestock products (milk, eggs, and meat), their production  
trends, national and global comparisons, contribution of the sector to Gross Value Added (GVA),  
exports, and employment creation. The section also covers sector’s performance in terms of  
infrastructure across the value chain, price variations and exports. Based on the sector analysis, key  
growth drivers and major challenges have been discussed. A number of previous studies, evaluation  
reports, and annual reports were reviewed through the course of the study, including those from UN  
Food and Agriculture Organisation (UNFAO), NABARD, Lok Sabha Standing Committee, NITI Aayog,

### Public/ Private Structures and Stakeholders

In the Animal Husbandry and Dairy sector, multiple public and private stakeholders contribute in  
driving growth. The apex government institution in livestock sector is the Ministry of Fisheries,  
Animal Husbandry and Dairying. The government structure and its associated stakeholders has been  
depicted in the figure below:

Figure 100 : Government Structure and Associated Stakeholders

Source: Analysed from various annual reports and websites of Ministry of Agriculture, Annual Report of Department of  
Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries. 2018- 19

The various divisions handling the implementation of different schemes has been mentioned under  
the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairy. The Department oversees the National Dairy  
Development Board, Veterinary Council of India and acts as an advisor to all State Governments. The  
Department also looks into the functioning of the listed Subordinate Offices.

Apart from the government institutions there are several stakeholders in the livestock sector. In  
dairy, the cooperative structure is well formed which is a three tier structure with Village Cooperative  
Society, District Union and State Federation. In addition, there are 14 Milk Producer Companies  
supported by National Dairy Plan, Tata Trusts and NRLM/ SRLM^119.

119  
Annual Report of Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries. 2018- 19

    112
    

Private stakeholders in dairy sector have grown at a fast pace over the last 20 years and have  
exceeded the combined capacity of the dairy cooperatives and the government dairies. Some of the  
leading private dairy companies are Nestle India Ltd., Anik Industries Pvt Ltd, Britannia Dairy Pvt  
Ltd, Parag Milk Foods, Bhole Baba Milk Food Industries, Lactalis India Ltd, etc.

### Key Drivers for Livestock Sector

The key drivers for growth in the Livestock Sector have been discussed below.

**Population Growth and Urbanization** : Increasing population with rapid urbanization has been  
driving the demand for meat, poultry and dairy products. As per the projected demand for meat and  
dairy products^120 , milk, eggs and meat are expected to surpass the demand for cereals.

    Egg 4 5.8 10 72.4%
    

_Source: Doubling Farmers’ Income Report, Volume VIIID-Production Enhancement through Productivity Gains_

With increase in disposable income, a larger proportion of the income is spent on meat, poultry and  
dairy products as opposed to primary sector food grains. The demand for dairy products is high in  
India owing to a large vegetarian population.

**Technical Innovation in Meat, Poultry and Dairy Product Processing** : Establishment of state-of-  
the-art facilities like mechanized abattoirs-cum-meat processing plants complying with standard  
sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) measures have improved the quality of meat and poultry products  
in the market. Similarly, the growth of the dairy industry is also dependent on the processing  
innovations that have contributed to the value chain of milk and milk products.

**Livestock Science and Technology** : Livestock breeding techniques including breed substitution,  
cross-breeding and within-breed selection has been an important factor influencing supply of meat  
and dairy products in the market. The quality of feed for animals and poultry also contributes to the  
quality of meat or dairy produced. Catering to the adequate nutritional needs of the farm animals and  
poultry results in higher productivity.

**Fast Changing Food Habits and Value Added Products** : The shift towards consumption of value-  
added products and frozen food has increased the demand for processed meat and dairy products  
such as cheese, yoghurt, UHT (ultra-heat treatment) milk, flavored milk, sausages, kebabs, patties,  
etc. As per the Indian meat market analysis^121 , chilled raw packaged meat (processed) was the fastest  
growing category (by volume) during 2012 – 2017, registering a CAGR of 5.99% followed by frozen  
meat which grew at 5.42%.

The production projections in the animal husbandry and dairy sector for 2022-23 are estimated to  
outpace the requirement given the current output growth rates. As per the table given below, the

(^120) Doubling Farmers’ Income report  
(^121) GlobalData, 2019, Meat Market in India: Market Snapshot to 2022,

    113
    

projected production of milk would be 204 million tonnes whereas according to the table on  
“Projected Demand of Meat, Eggs and Dairy” provided above the demand would reach 170 million  
tonnes that too by 2030. Similarly in meat, the production is predicted to reach 14.6 million tonnes  
by 2022-23 whereas the demand for meat would reach 9.2 million tonnes by 2030. This would mean  
production at the current rate would still create a surplus of milk and meat products in the country.

### 1.1 Background of the Sector

### Gross Value Added (GVA)^122 from Animal Husbandry and Dairy products

The GVA from the sector in 2017-18 was Rs. 4.93 lakh crores, which contributed to about 4.1% of the  
total GVA of the Indian economy. The relative share of the sector as percentage of agriculture and  
allied sector has increased from 21.8 % in 2011-12 to 27.4% in 2017-18. The trend in GVA from  
livestock sector^123 since 2011-12 is depicted below.

The trend in GVA from crops and livestock sector is provided in figure below. The data indicates that  
while GVA from livestock sector has shown a consistent positive growth, the trend for crops sector  
has been inconsistent. Since 2011-12, rate of growth in livestock sector has been much higher at 6.5%  
than crops sector which grew at 1.05%. The share of GVA of crops in Indian economy also declined  
from 12.1% in 2011-12 to 8.7% in 2017-18, while livestock sector has kept pace with overall  
economic growth and consistently remained around 4%. This clearly indicates the increasing  
contribution of livestock sector in economy.

Major products within livestock sector can be classified as milk group, meat group, eggs, wool and  
hair etc. In 2017-18, about 96.88% of total value of output from livestock sector came from milk  
group of products (66.22%), meat and meat products (22.03%), eggs (3.23%) and dung (5.36%). The  
contribution of wool and hair to the overall output from livestock sector was negligible at 0.07%^124.

The product wise trends in GVA from livestock sector are given in the table below. The GVA from  
livestock sector increased by about 50.8% between 20 11 - 12 and 2017-18. During this period, the  
contribution of milk group of products has been highest. Contribution from meat group of products  
also grew consistently as it increased by about Rs. 53.13 thousand crores (having a growth of about  
55% during the period). The only category to show a reduction of GVA during the period was wool  
and hair which reduced by about 10% with a production value of Rs. 447 crores in 2017-18.

### Livestock ownership and dependence on livelihood

According to 20th Livestock Census of India, the total livestock population^127 was 536.76 million in  
2019 which showed an increase of 4.82%. The total bovine population^128 of the country was 303 .7 6  
million which shows an increase of 1.3% over the previous census. Total cattle population has  
increased by 1.3% with around 29.3% increase in exotic breeds. The overall population of female  
indigenous/non-descript cattle increased by 10% while population of male indigenous cattle  
reduced by 29%. Similar trend was observed for buffalo population wherein the male buffalo  
population went down by 42.3% while female population increased by 8.61%. The summary of the  
livestock census is shown in the table below:

Poultry population also increased substantially by 16.8% to about 851.81 million in this period with  
significant increase in backyard poultry by 45.8%. In other types of livestock, the population of goats  
and sheep increased by 10.1% and 14.1% respectively and population of pigs decreased by 12.03%.  
The top five states in terms of livestock population in India are Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya  
Pradesh, West Bengal, and Bihar. These states together account for about 44.6% of overall livestock  
population. The highest livestock population (about 68 million) is reported in Uttar Pradesh. Uttar  
Pradesh is also home to the largest bovine population (about 52.04 million) in the country which is  
about 17.2% of total bovine population and 30% of buffalo population of India.  
While northern states lead in livestock and bovine population, poultry is mostly concentrated in  
southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The top five poultry producing states  
(Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal and Maharashtra) of India account for more  
than 54% of total poultry population in the country.  
At the household level, livestock resources are considerably distributed across India as marginal  
farmers have more than half of the cattle population and own more than 60 percent of small  
ruminants’ i.e. goats, pigs.^129 More than 57.8 million Households (HHs) in India own cattle, more than  
34 million HHs own buffaloes, about 27 million HHs own goats, 2.6 million HHs own sheep and over  
23.7 million HHs rear poultry^130.

**Dependence of Farming HHs on Livestock**

The dependence of small and marginal farmers on livestock, as reported in Economic Survey of 2016-  
17, is very high. Among the households that possess less than 0.4 hectares of land, almost 50 percent  
of average household expenditure on productive assets is incurred on livestock and poultry.  
Economic Survey 2017-18 has highlighted the increasing share of livestock in total farm income. It  
has reported that the share of livestock in total farm income has increased from 4% in 2002-03 to 13  
% in 2012-13.

Livestock is one of the sectors where women play an important role and are engaged actively for  
livelihood. Nearly 43.8 lakhs women producers are involved in diary societies and number of all dairy  
women societies is also growing at an annual growth rate of about 10%^131. Considering the increasing  
share of livestock in farm income of small and marginal farmers and increasing participation of  
women in livestock sector, the need of re-orientation of government policies towards increased focus  
on allied activities such as dairying and livestock development have been highlighted in Economic  
survey 2017- 18132.

### Production trends of important livestock products

_.1.1.1 Milk_

**Status of milk production in India**

India is the largest producer of milk globally contributing nearly 21.6% percent of global production  
in 2017-18.^133 The production trends of top five milk producing countries (India, USA, Pakistan, China  
and Brazil) are depicted in the diagram below.

Figure 104 : Comparison of Milk production across globe

Source: UN FAO

All five countries reported increase in the level of production of milk since 1990. The growth of milk  
production in India surpassed all others as the overall milk production has increased by more than  
250% in past 27 years. As a result of this unprecedented growth, India, which used to lag behind USA  
in 1990’s, has been the undisputed global leader since 2000.^134

In India, Uttar Pradesh (30 million MT) is the largest producer of milk as of 2018-19 with around  
16% of the production share in the country. The other major milk producing states in India are  
Rajasthan (23.6 million MT), Madhya Pradesh (15.9 million MT), Andhra Pradesh (15 million MT)  
and Gujarat (14.4 million MT) as of 2018-19.

133  
Annual production of 176.3 million MT in 2017-18 and estimated production of 187 million MT in 2018- 19

Source: Analysis of data from Basic Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Statistics 2019

The milk production trends of top five states vis-à-vis India are depicted above. As can be seen from  
the graph, the overall milk production in India increased significantly between FY 2013 and FY 2018  
by about 36%. This growth can be majorly attributed to the states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan  
which recorded an increase of more than 50% during this period.^135

The increase in milk production in India is mainly due to the increase in population of milch  
animals^136 as the milk productivity remains a concern with an average yield of 4 litres per day per  
milch cattle, in comparison to global average of about 7 litres per day^137. In India, higher productivity  
is observed in the states of Punjab, Gujarat, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh and Kerala whereas the  
states with low yield are Assam, Nagaland, Odisha and Himachal Pradesh^138.

**Per Capita Availability of Milk**

Presently, the per capita availability of milk in India is about 375 gm/day which is higher than the  
world average of 309 gm/day^139.

Figure 106 : Trend in per capita availability of milk (gms/day)

Source: The World Dairy Situation, Bulletin of International Dairy Federation, 2018

The trend in per capita availability of milk in India since 2000-01 is depicted in the graph above. It  
can be seen that per capita availability has increased by about 72% since 2000. This gains significance  
as milk is a major protein source for a largely vegetarian population. However, there is a wide  
interstate variability in per capita availability. For instance, the states of Punjab (1120 gm/day),  
Haryana (1005 gm/day) and Rajasthan (834 gm/day) have reported high per capita availability of  
milk whereas Assam (71 gm/day), Orissa (132 gm/day), West Bengal (153 gm/day), Kerala (192  
gm/day) and Bihar (239 gm/day) have reported lower per capita availability^140.

**Yield rate**

The average yield of milk per day per milch cattle is low in India. The species wise overall milk  
contribution and average yield of milk per day per animal for FY 2017-18 is depicted in the table  
below.^141

As can be seen the average yield rate of milk per day for animals across species in India is very low  
in comparison to countries such as Israel (36.75Kg/day), USA (28.67 Kg/day), Denmark  
(27.11Kg/day)^142. The yield rate of milk from cows has been compared with the top yield rates across  
the globe.

The indigenous and non-descript cows have very low yield of about 3.73 and 2.41 kg/day  
respectively which contribute to only about 20% of overall production. The exotic and crossbred  
cows having better yield of about 11.48 kg/day and 7.61 kg/day respectively contribute nearly about  
27% of overall milk production. Buffaloes contribute about 49% of overall milk production. Though  
the cross bred and exotic species contribute significantly to the overall milk production, their  
population, as reported in 20th livestock census, is only about 16.7% of all milch cattle. In view of  
this, Government of India has launched Rashtriya Gokul Mission in recent years for improving the  
overall productivity of indigenous milch cattle in India.

**Quality Standards of Milk and Milk Products**

The quality standards of milk and milk products in India are mainly driven by provisions of Food  
Safety and Standards Act 2006. FSSAI revised its provisions in 2017 and 2018 to widen the scope of  
products under the purview of the Act. The standards cover more than 18 items (e.g milk, cheese,  
shrikhand, ghee, ice cream, flavoured milk, milk powder etc.)^143. All milk food business operators are  
required to comply with these regulations for processing and trade of milk and milk products. Some  
of the important definitions specified under the Act are:

The total urea content in the milk should be less than 700 PPM. The notification also provides  
specifications on additives, hygiene, labelling, contaminants toxins and residue. The notification has  
separate quality specifications for flavoured milk, concentrated milk, sweetened condensed milk,  
khoa, cream and other milk products.

**Quality Mark**^145

NDDB has developed a set of protocol and practices for meeting food safety and management  
requirement of milk and milk product manufacturing. The logo/ symbol of Quality Mark on milk and  
milk product packages conveys that the unit has adopted and implemented specified processes as  
per food safety and quality management system and is in accordance with set quality parameters.  
The quality mark logo was registered under trademarks act in 1999. The essential requirements of  
quality mark includes valid license from FSSAI, accreditation from Quality and Food Safety  
Management System (such as ISO 22000/FSSC 22000 or ISO 9001 with HACCP certifications-IS

15000.  from certifying bodies short listed by the National Accreditation Board for Certification Body  
    (NABCB) / International Accreditation Forum (IAF), valid clearance from state pollution control  
    board and compliance in necessary conditions for water use.

Award of quality mark is a two-step process which includes preliminary and final assessment. The  
unit needs to score at least 70% in preliminary assessment to be eligible for final assessment. The  
parameters of evaluation under final assessment are categorized into Critical, Major and Minor  
parameters. The unit needs to ensure 100% in compliance of critical parameters^146. As on 31st March  
2019, NDDB received 102 applications for quality mark, of these 32 units were found eligible for  
Quality mark and 67 units were informed about areas of improvement^147. In addition to Quality mark,  
FSSAI has also issued guidelines for compliance with good management practices in 2018^148.

**International Standards**

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) allows governments to act on trade in order to  
protect human life and health. While the WTO member countries are encouraged to use international  
standards such as FAO/ WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission for food, the agreement on Sanitary  
and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures allows the countries to set their own standards^149.

There are many countries where Indian dairy products are restricted due to standards and trade  
barriers by those countries e.g. Due to extremely strict sanitary and phytosanitary standards in  
European countries, they do not approve any of the Indian milk products^150.

Some of the measures identified to overcome these trade barriers particularly for enabling access to  
European markets are provided below^151.

**1\. Implement product traceability-** A key barrier to export is the lack of traceability.  
Implementation of product traceability can help in overcoming SPS barrier.  
**2\. Strengthen testing procedures and follow global best practices-** General Principles of Food  
Hygiene (GPH) based on the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system for milk  
production and processing should be followed throughout the milk supply chain.^152  
**3\. Clear distinction between cow and buffalo milk-** European countries and USA have preference  
for cow milk while a significant proportion of milk in India is from buffalo, labelling/ branding of  
product will help in providing clear distinction whether the milk is from cow, buffalo or is mixed.  
**4\. Quality compliance-** Quality compliance is a major issue.

**Recent initiatives towards achieving International Standards**

*   National Dairy Plan-I and Rashtriya Gokul Mission with introduction of unique 12 digit  
    Animal ID and animal health cards are trying to strengthen its effort in ensuring product  
    traceability, the quality mark standards and good animal management practices, etc.
*   The Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) control programs under Livestock Health and Disease  
    Control have been successful in controlling instances of FMD in many areas, a separate budget  
    head for controlling FMD under National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) has  
    been provided in Budget 2019.

_.1.1.2 Poultry and Eggs_

**Status of Production**

Poultry including eggs production has made significant progress in India in the last four decades.  
India, which ranked 14th globally in terms of egg production in 1971, is now the 3rd largest egg  
producer after China and USA. China is the global leader in egg production accounting for nearly 42%  
of global egg production whereas India accounts for only 5.57%. In 2017, the top five egg producing  
countries were China, USA, India, Mexico and Brazil accounting for 60.9% of the global egg  
production^153.

Figure 109 : Egg production in major countries

The production trend of these five countries over 2014 to 2018 is depicted in the above graph. The  
global egg production increased by about 8% over these five years whereas egg production^154 in India  
grew by around 27% over the same period.

Egg production in India has jumped from 50.66 billion eggs in 2006-07 to 103.3 billion in 2018-19.  
Within India, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana^155 , West Bengal and Maharashtra were the  
leading egg producer states in 2018-19 and accounted for nearly 65% of total egg production in the  
country. Tamil Nadu accounted for 19% of total production in 2018-19, followed by AP accounting  
for about 18% of the total production. West Bengal registered the highest growth of 61% in egg  
production among top producer states in India during 2013- 17156.

**Per capita availability of egg in India**

Egg is a nutritious functional food, rich in protein, vitamins, folate, iron, selenium and zinc. Due to  
presence of nutrients such as lutein, egg provides health benefits beyond its nutrient content^157.

Egg and poultry consumption is growing in India at fast pace. Along with the increasing demand, the  
production levels are also going up; the production of eggs has multiplied by 50 times since 1951 and  
the per capita availability of eggs in India has grown by nearly 15 times^158 in the same period.

graph above. There has been a consistent growth during this period as the per capita availability  
doubled from 36 eggs per annum in 2000 to 79 eggs per annum in 2018- 19159.

_.1.1.3 Meat_

**Status of Production**

Meat production has grown in India over the years and it contributes significantly to India’s exports.  
India is the 6th largest producer of meat^160 in the world although it contributes to less than 3% of  
global meat production. China is the largest producer and contributes about 30% of global meat  
production. China, USA, Brazil, Russia and Germany are top five meat producing countries accounting  
for more than 60% of global meat production.

Meat production in India has grown nearly 4 times since 2000. In FY 2018, the estimated meat  
production in India was 8.11 million MT. Meat group of products accounted for nearly 22.03% of  
value of output from livestock sector as of 2017-18 (at constant prices).

The National Accounts Classifications and value of output (in Rs. Billion) for each category of meat  
sub group of products in India estimated in 2016-17 is provided below^161.

### Exports^164

Indian meat is generally of good quality having much lesser average fat content (4%) than that of  
developed countries (15-20%)^165. Moreover, progress in Indian animal health system has ensured  
that Indian meat is largely free from foot and mouth disease, mad cow disease, rinderpest, contagious  
bovine pleuropneumonia, etc. Since 2014, India has exported livestock and associated produce worth  
Rs. 1.53 lakh crores. However, the value of exports from livestock products has declined from about  
Rs. 33,128 lakhs in 2014-15 to about Rs. 30,632 lakhs in 2018- 19166.

As can be seen above, buffalo meat constitutes about 66.56% of total quantity exported and 87.1% of  
total value of exports from India. In terms of value per MT, exported buffalo meat was valued at Rs  
1.98 lakhs/MT whereas dairy products were valued higher at Rs. 2.15 lakh/MT. Among the product  
classes, value from export of Albumin protein is highest at Rs. 5.83 lakhs/MT, while poultry products  
are lowest at Rs. 0.11 lakh/MT.  
Except for USA, most of the export destinations for India are in Asia and Middle East. South East Asian  
countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia are the largest importer of Buffalo meat from  
India. In 2018-19, about 63.45% of the total Buffalo meat were exported to Vietnam, Malaysia and  
Indonesia.  
Vietnam is one of the largest importers of Indian livestock products, as it imported nearly 46% of  
Buffalo meat and about 88.5% of animal casing from India in 2018-19 in terms of quantity. Vietnam  
was also the 2nd largest importer of Albumin, 4th largest importer of poultry and 3rd largest importer  
of caseins. Other important export destinations of livestock and dairy products are UAE, USA, Saudi  
Arab, Qatar, Thailand, Japan, Oman, Bangladesh and Egypt.  
**Trends in Buffalo Meat Exports**  
Buffalo meat exports have declined by about 16% since FY 2014. In addition, sheep/goat meat and  
casein exports have also registered a reduction of about 19% and 31% respectively. On the other  
hand, exports of dairy products registered an increase of about 71%. As mentioned earlier, the overall  
value of exports from livestock products has declined since 2014-15. This can be attributed to the  
decline of Buffalo meat exports, which contributes more than 80% of the overall value of exports.

This decline in buffalo meat exports can be attributed to reduction in production of meat in UP which  
is home to the largest buffalo population in India.

**Global Scenario**

Livestock products are one of the leading agri-export commodities of India. It has a share of 3.9% of  
the total global export of meat and edible meat offal. However, at the global level, the share of total  
export of livestock products (meat and edible meat offal^168 ) has been reduced by 14% in 2018 over  
the last year and is currently pegged at ~USD 3727 million^169. In the global trade of meat and edible  
meat offal, India ranks 11th. The top 10 exporters of livestock products along with their respective  
share in the world livestock exports as of 2018 is shown in the following figure.

The dairy products traded from India includes fresh butter, buttermilk, butteroil, fresh cheese, milk  
for babies, milk & cream in powder, skimmed milk powder, whole milk and ghee. The major export  
destinations for dairy products are Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Bangladesh and Bhutan^170.  
However, at the global level, the export value of dairy products^171 from India is pegged at ~480  
million USD, which constitutes 0.53% of the world’s export value. In global trade, India ranks 32nd  
given its current export value in dairy products. The top 5 exporters of dairy products as of 2018 in  
comparison to India’s export is shown in the following figure.

### Infrastructure

Indian dairy sector is facing challenge in disposal of surplus milk production. Due to weak  
international market and sustained growth in domestic milk production in 2018-19, the export-  
oriented processing plants in India reduced purchasing milk from farmers. As a result, the surplus  
milk got diverted to dairy cooperatives resulting in a 6.8% increase in average milk procurement.  
While the sale of liquid milk increased only 1.4%, the net surplus was converted mainly into SMP and  
butter as these had longer shelf life. In the process, the cooperative dairies commenced the following  
year with unsold stocks of skimmed milk products, butter and ghee. The increased procurement in  
summer and unsold inventory is putting severe pressure on cooperatives. However, the revival in  
export of skimmed milk products this year has provided some relief, but the subdued market prices  
of SMP in domestic market are adversely affecting the margins of dairy cooperatives^172.

India has bulk milk coolers with a total capacity of 37.66 million litres, dairy plants with a capacity of  
72,919 TLPD and chilling centres with capacity of 18,045 TLPD.

As can be seen, the west zone has better infrastructure with Gujarat having the best dairy  
infrastructure available among all the states. Gujarat leads all states with Bulk Milk coolers having a  
capacity of 17.53 million litres, chilling centres with capacity of 6,435 TLPD and dairy plants with  
capacity of 24,175 TLPD.

As observed from the household (HH) survey, livestock farmers have been accessing various  
infrastructures, many of which are created by the dairy cooperative federations. Schemes such as  
National Dairy Plan I, Rashtriya Gokul Mission have led to development of artificial insemination or  
semen collection centers, setting up of bulk milk coolers and establishment of veterinary hospitals  
and dispensaries.

The analysis shows that beneficiaries under White Revolution scheme have better access to the  
commonly used service points. As it can be seen from the graph, the average distance covered by  
livestock farmers under White Revolution to reach out to various livestock services is lesser than  
average distance covered by eligible non beneficiaries. Among the animal husbandry services, it can  
be observed that markets of sale and purchase of livestock is 6.5 km on an average and scheme  
beneficiaries also have not been able to have better access than eligible non-beneficiaries. This  
analysis shows that distance may be a factor in availing the benefits of the scheme.

### Post-Harvest Losses in Livestock

Livestock produce such as raw and processed meat, milk and eggs are highly perishable and require  
proper handling, storage and distribution. An assessment of the post-harvest losses in the livestock  
sector was conducted by ICAR-CIPHET in 2015. The economic loss due the post-harvest loss in  
livestock sector has been assessed to have a monetary value of Rs 10,906 Crores during 2012- 13  
which consists of 12% of the total agriculture and allied sector loss.

In case of meat including poultry meat, the losses were attributed to inefficiencies in processing and  
repeated interruption of electricity supply during freezing. Egg shell damage and egg breakage  
during laying, gathering, grading, packaging and transportation as well as rotten eggs have been the  
causes of losses in eggs^180. Post-harvest losses for eggs were observed to be low in case of mechanized  
and organized egg production as compared to backyard poultry farming and unorganized farms with  
high temperatures. Storage loss, loss during sorting using traditional techniques, was also a  
significantly high. Non usage of cold storage for eggs led to higher overall losses. Post-harvest losses  
in meat was attributed to wholesale storage level loss and due to insufficient refrigeration. In case of  
other meat, the loss was caused by inefficiencies in grading, insufficient storage in deep freezers.

Losses in dairy have been found to be on account of spoilages, wastages, spillages, drainages of milk  
from plant, packaging and storage losses. The farm operations and extent of coverage considered for  
the study in livestock produce included the following:

The recommendations to reduce post-harvest losses focused on the following aspects:

    − Strengthening the storage channels,
    − Handling livestock in cold chain immediately after harvest
    − Address butcher shops and retailers on technological interventions
    − Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points to maintain hygiene standards
    

### Price of Livestock Produce

The inputs and services involved in livestock management are classified into following four  
categories under National Account Statistics:

*   Feed of livestock
*   Current repairs, maintenance of fixed assets & other operational costs
*   Market charges
*   Financial intermediation services

During 2012-2016, the value of inputs and services (at 2011 prices) for livestock management was  
approximately 30% of total value of output^181. This is essentially the cost of inputs and services that  
are involved in management of livestock. It is deducted from total value of output to calculate GVA of  
the sector. The average cost incurred per year on inputs and services from 2012 to 2016 was

181  
Output and Value added from Livestock sector, National Accounts Statistics, 2018

    141
    

estimated at about Rs. 1.71 lakh crores. About 97% of the overall cost of inputs and services was  
incurred on livestock feed while market charges, financial services and maintenance cost constitute  
only 3% of total cost^182.

**Trends in prices of livestock produce**

The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) captures the prices of goods before it reaches to retailers. The WPI  
is an important indicator of inflation in economy. The WPI basket in India has 697 items and the food  
articles among these items have a weightage of 15.25. Milk has the highest weightage among food  
articles, as higher weights are assigned to item on the basis of its net traded value in the base year  
2011 - 12183. Higher weights assigned to an item represent its relative importance.

The weightage of all food categories across the basket are provided under^184.

As can be seen in the table, the  
inflation in milk products is growing  
at much higher pace than other  
livestock products. Between 2014  
and 2018, the prices of milk rose by  
about 26%, while prices of egg,  
meat and fish increased by only  
10%.

As observed in the HH survey,  
between 2015-16 and 2018-19 the  
price of milk being sold by the dairy  
farmers has increased by 25%.  
Increase in the average price of milk  
among livestock farmers during the said period has been depicted in the graph alongside.

**Variations in Milk and Milk products across different states**

The price of milk and milk products also varies across various states. The analysis of the milk  
procurement and sale of milk (including full cream milk, toned milk and double tonned milk) data of  
all leading milk cooperatives in the country has been shown below to depict the variations observed  
in different states and regions.

    A higher margin in full cream milk accounts for the
    procurement cost of milk. The region-wise sale of
    milk depicts the distinct skewedness in Western and
    Southern region. Western region has the largest
    share of milk sale followed by Southern states. In the
    Western region, Gujarat is the largest consumer of
    milk with 102.96 lakh litres of sale per day as against
    174 lakh litre sale from Western region.
    

### Discussion on Cross Sectional Thematic Areas

    i. Accountability and Transparency
    

Livestock sector in India is an important domain providing nutritional security to millions of people,  
and generating gainful employment in the rural sector, particularly among the landless, small and  
marginal farmers and women. The vast source of livestock and poultry resources have been  
contributing to the livelihoods of rural masses. Animal husbandry and dairying is a state subject. The  
Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying assists the growth and sustainable development of  
this sector to each State Government for control of animal diseases, scientific management and  
upgradation of genetic resources, increasing availability of nutritious feed and fodder, sustainable  
development of processing and marketing facilities and enhancement of production and profitability  
of livestock enterprises. The Department is responsible for livestock production, preservation,  
protection & improvement of stocks and dairy development. Some of the key institutions responsible  
for a holistic development of the sector includes:

*   National Dairy Development Board: assisting in accelerating the pace of dairy development  
    through farmers’ cooperatives
*   Veterinary Council of India: assisting in regulation of veterinary practices as well as for  
    maintaining uniform standards of veterinary education

The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying is responsible for the subjects such as Livestock  
Census, Livestock Statistics, matters relating to loss of livestock due to natural calamities, regulation  
of livestock importation, animal quarantine and certification. The maintenance of data on the  
livestock sector growth is available in the following formats:

*   The physical progress in the livestock sector across various schemes, livestock statistics, and  
    livestock health is published in the DADF Online portal^186 of the department.

    ii. Direct/ indirect employment generation
    

Dairy subsector engages landless, small & marginal farmers particularly women as an occupation.  
Around 95% of milk producers in India holds 1 to 5 milch animals per household as a part of  
subsistence farming system. The livestock sub-sector contributes significantly to the rural income –  
around 12% of income in rural households comes from animal farming. Out of 12% of income derived  
from livestock rearing about 69% comes from dairying (milk). As per 70th round of NSSO, livestock  
rearing was the principal source of income to about 3.7 per cent of the agricultural households.^187  
Among agricultural households with very small parcels of land (less than 0.01 hectare), one-fifth  
households reported livestock as their principal source of income. The resource poor rural  
households’ own majority of the livestock resources to supplement their income in lean seasons.

In India, around 2.733 million households are self-employed in livestock sector with major source of  
earnings coming from this occupation^188. The state-wise distribution of households having major  
source of income from livestock sector has been shown below:

Assam has the highest percentage of households dependent on livestock rearing, followed by Punjab  
and Rajasthan. Indian dairy industry employs about 8.47 million people on yearly basis out of which  
71% are women.^189

The distribution of livestock rearing among different categories of households (by operational  
holding) as per 70th round of NSSO is given below:

Table 38 : Distribution of Livestock among various HH categorized by operational holdings

    Sl. Livestock/poultry Average no. of livestock/poultry owned per 1000 household by

_Source: NSSO 70th Round_

While the households with larger operational holdings (e.g., medium or large) have higher number  
of bovine, sheep and goat, the households with smaller operational holdings (e.g., landless, marginal,  
small or semi-medium), have higher ownership of pig and poultry.

It is also observed from the primary survey that 98% of livestock farmers are engaged as self-  
employed or unpaid workers within their own households for livestock related activities.

    iii. Gender Mainstreaming
    

Livestock rearing is an important source of livelihoods for rural communities and livestock is  
considered as a critical asset for the household. The upkeep of livestock is divided among the rural  
men and women based on their knowledge. Often the responsibilities in livestock rearing is assigned  
according to the customary gender roles. Women comprise about 43% of the agricultural labour  
force globally and in developing countries^190 and its even higher in livestock rearing activities. In  
rural livestock-based economies women represent two-thirds (approximately 400 million people)^191  
of low-income livestock keepers, mostly carrying out activities around milking, processing of milk,  
and background poultry.

Women constitute about 69% of workforce engaged in livestock sector^192 , playing a dominant role in  
most of the livestock rearing activities. The tasks involve feeding, taking care of young and sick  
animals, milking, etc. It is estimated that in the dairying sector more than 70% of women are  
employed and over 90% care & management of livestock are carried out by women.^193

With women handling a significant amount of activities in the livestock sector activities, there has  
been emphasis from the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries to promote  
women empowerment. The role of men and women is perceived to be complementary in the field of

animal husbandry. However, it is also understood that women have been at the fore front of dairy  
cooperative movement, which was initially carried under the Operation Flood Programme and later  
also under the Integrated Dairy Development Programme implemented by the Government.

In the poultry sector, especially in rural backyard poultry which is an income supplementing scheme  
mostly implemented by women, priority in training is being given to women. Women farmers are  
encouraged in rearing of small ruminants and the scheme for conservation of breeds, the  
conservation of sheep, goat and small ruminants has made the required provisions. The department  
has set up Gender Budget Cell in order to tackle gender imbalances, promote gender equality and  
development of women. However, the Department has not earmarked any specific funds for women  
component. It has only been advising States/ Implementing Agencies for utilizing around 30% of  
allocated funds towards women  
beneficiaries under the existing  
Centrally Sponsored/Central Sector  
schemes being implemented by the  
Department.

As observed in the HH survey, out of  
all animal livestock workers, 51.4%  
are women engaged in their own  
households in the animal husbandry  
activities as self-employed or unpaid  
workers. The analysis of male and  
female workers engaged in animal

    iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient
    practices & diversification
    

Climate change has impacts on productivity in the livestock sector like the agriculture sector.  
Production of dairy, meat and wool production is likely to be impacted negatively mainly due to lower  
availability of grass and grazing land leading to fodder scarcity. Heat Distress due to high temperature  
on animals can reduce the rate of animal feed intake and cause poor growth^194. The productivity is  
adversely affected by water scarcity and extreme weather events such as droughts, dry spells, erratic  
rainfall, flood, etc. One of the studies on impact of climate change on livestock^195 has shown that  
annual rainfall is a highly significant determinant for productivity of milk, especially in buffaloes  
(buffaloes require comparatively more water than cows and hence termed water buffaloes). Climate  
change could further lead to increased emergence of livestock diseases and disease epidemics, as  
higher temperatures and changed rainfall patterns can alter the abundance, distribution and  
transmission of animal pathogens. With climatic variability having a negative influence on livestock  
productivity, it is critical to adopt rainwater conservation, harvesting, and recycling along with better

management of CPRs (common property resources) as an adaptation strategy. Some of the  
adaptation measures to climate variability has been discussed below:

**Effective Integration of Livestock with Agricultural Systems** : In order to address the impact of  
climate change, increasing livestock productivity and integrating it effectively into agricultural  
system is considered as an effective strategy. This would improve the soil health and water retention  
by returning the valuable biomass to the soil and would help in drought proofing. Such recycling of  
carbon into the soil would not only enhance the soil quality but also help in carbon sequestration.  
Use of livestock as draft power can reduce the need for fossil fuels. Methane generated from animal  
waste could provide cooking fuel for rural households through developing biogas energy solutions  
resulting into increased carbon sequestration.

**Germplasm Diversity** : Maintaining diversity in livestock breeds that perform well under adverse  
climatic conditions like high temperature, drought and feed scarcity can help address the  
phenomenon. Most of the indigenous breeds have high potential to adjust in adverse climate. Some  
of them have been mentioned below:

*   Cattle: Kankrej, Tharparkar, Deoni, Ongole, Nagauri, Hallikar, etc
*   Buffalo: Surti, Jaffrabadi; Goat: Sirohi, Osmanabadi, Jamunapari, Jhalawadi, Marwari; and
*   Sheep: Patanwadi, Magra, Malpura, Mandya, etc.

Selection of the less vulnerable breeds of livestock can also help is combatting disease outbreaks  
caused by prolonged drought, exposure to novel pathogens etc.

**Measures of Climate Change Mitigation**

Livestock sector is also responsible for contributing to the global warming by generating significant  
emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide. As per FAO estimates, the global  
livestock sector annually emits about 8.1 gigatonnes of CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 eq.)^196.

Emissions from livestock supply chains originate from four main processes: enteric fermentation,  
manure management, feed production and energy consumption^197. According to the Global Livestock  
Environmental Assessment Model of FAO, Enteric fermentation^198 accounts for 44 percent of total  
sector's emissions, with about 3.5 gigatonnes CO 2 - eq. Feed production is the second largest source of  
emissions, with 3.3 gigatonnes CO2-eq or about 41 percent of total emissions. Manure management  
is responsible for almost 10 percent of the total, or 0.8 gigatonnes CO 2 - eq. Energy consumption, both  
on-farm and post-farm, account for 0.4 gigatonnes CO 2 - eq, or nearly 5 percent of the total.

The countries that contribute the most methane emissions related to livestock production are India,  
China, Brazil, and the United States. India, with the largest livestock population in the world, adds to  
the methane emission leading to global warming. Cattle and buffalo are the major sources of methane  
among India’s livestock accounting for 98 per cent.^199 While agriculture in India is responsible for

16% of total Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions in the country, 74% of this is due to methane  
produced from livestock – largely cows and buffalo – and rice cultivation^200.

Estimated GHG emission based on livestock resources are as follows:

*   Beef cattle contribute the most with 41% of the sector’s emission
*   Dairy cattle (20%)
*   Swine (9%)
*   Buffalo (8%)
*   Poultry (8%)
*   Small ruminant (6%).^201

The adaptation and mitigation measures that can significantly impact in reducing the GHG emissions  
are discussed below:

**Modification in Production and Management Systems** in livestock rearing is done through  
diversification of livestock animals and crops, integration of livestock systems with forestry and crop  
production, and changing the timing and locations of farm operations. It can increase drought and  
heat wave tolerance and reduce diseases. Agroforestry can help in increasing productivity, and  
improve quality of air, soil, and water. Increase in afforestation can help in carbon sequestration.

**Changes in Breeding practices** reduces heat tolerance of livestock by adopting high resistant  
breeds of animal for breeding. Developing international gene banks to improve breeding programs  
implemented through international collaboration can help in achieving it.

**Capability Building of Farmers** can be done to enable them to recognize the problem and undertake  
climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.

**Manure Management** is a mitigation measure which can be practiced through shortening storage  
duration, improving timing and application of manure, use of anaerobic digesters, covering the  
storage, and changing the animal diets. Similar mitigation measures can be taken through fertilizer  
management adopting practices like opting organic, fertilizers and conducting regular soil testing.

Currently the cattle slurry is being used as manure for fields or being processed for fuel use in  
households in India. As per the findings of the HH survey, around 34% of livestock farmers use cattle  
slurry in pasture fields while 36% of livestock farmers use the resource for fuel use in household.

In the HH survey, the manure storage practices being taken up by livestock farmers has been  
analyzed. Livestock farmers are found to be mostly using dry lot, followed by solid storage facilities  
and pit storage for manure management. The trend of practices of manure management among  
livestock farmers as observed in the primary survey is shown in the chart alongside. Around 37%  
livestock farmers use solid storage facility which is a good practice. Around 17% livestock farmers  
opt for pit storage and 10% practice daily spread.

    Case Study on Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change
    resilient practices & diversifications
    Introduction: The impact of livestock rearing on global warming has been found to be significantly
    high. One of the key factors causing is the methane emission from the enteric fermentation of
    ruminant livestock, which is a main source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Methane emission is
    also associated with dietary energy loss; hence, reduce feed efficiency. To address the issue of
    methane emission from ruminants, changing fermentation pattern through dietary alteration has
    been proved one of the most effective ways of methane abatement. Desirable dietary changes
    provide two fold benefits i.e. improve production and reduce GHG emissions. Overall dietary
    manipulation by selecting more starch and less fibre in the animal feed is found to be producing
    less methane per kg feed DM but also form a basis for higher feed intake and higher production per
    animal. In New Zealand, on-farm emissions intensity of livestock production across the New
    Zealand dairy, sheep and beef sectors has reduced by approximately 1% per annum between 1990
    and 2013.

    v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan Component of the Scheme
    in Mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste Population
    

The Schedules Tribes, and Scheduled Castes constitute around 8.2% and 16.2% respectively. They  
cover a significantly large proportion of the population and is considered as one of the most  
economically deprived section of the society. The farmers belonging to these social groups have low  
availability of land and do not have much income generating options. Across the country, percentage  
of ST and SC households dependent on livestock are 0.75% and 1.5% respectively^203. The state wise  
percentages of ST and SC households dependent on livestock sector have been shown in the graph  
below:

203  
Livestock Ownership in India, NSS 70th Round

    Solution : In New Zealand, on-farm emissions intensity of livestock production across the New
    Zealand dairy, sheep and beef sectors has reduced by approximately 1% per annum between 1990
    and 2013^1. New Zealand has a high dependence on its agricultural activities and the emissions
    from agriculture sector has one of the highest contribution to New Zealand’s greenhouse gas
    emissions (48% in 2012). Measures were taken up to impact the efficiency of animal rearing
    including supplementary feeding practices which increase resilience against climate variability, in
    particular droughts, irrigation measures and reduced use of chemical fertilizers for grazing land.
    The effects of actions on emissions intensity of livestock production resulted in increasing per
    animal production and increased efficiency of fertiliser use per animal. The steady reduction of
    greenhouse gas emissions per unit of product by about 1% per year (across the dairy, sheep and
    beef sectors) for at least the last 20 years is thus attributed to the feed consumed by animals is
    used for production than for animal maintenance as well as the fertiliser use per cow. This was
    ensured through close interaction between farmers, government and research programmes
    focusing on productivity and on GHG emissions monitoring and mitigation. The solutions, which led
    to the successful reduction in emission, thus focused on feed and nutrition, genetics and breeding,
    rumen modification, manure and fertiliser management, animal health and increasing the carbon
    content of soils.
    Learnings for India: India owns around 11.8% of the total cattle and hence poses serious threat
    in terms of GHG emissions. The strategy of addressing the existing issue of cattle feed and fodder
    shortage in the country needs to include the learnings from the New Zealand model. Currently, the
    feed and fodder for ruminants is already facing a severe shortage issue which is predicted to
    increase in the upcoming years. With green fodder facing the most severe shortage, focus can be
    drawn on preparation and use of starch rich concentration feed. The innovative hydroponic
    technology being piloted to produce fodder can also ensure controlled use of nitrogen based
    fertilizers content reducing the GHG emissions from the enteric fermentation of ruminant livestock.

As depicted in the graph above, 5.54 percent of the total ST households and 13.27 percent of total SC  
households in Assam reported their livelihood dependence on animal rearing, which is the highest  
among the major states, for both the social groups.

The Department of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries has earmarked 8.2% of the funds under Tribal  
Sub Plan and 16.2% of the funds under Scheduled Caste Sub Plan as per the guidelines issued by the  
Planning Commission vide D.O. letter No.N- 11016/12(1)/ 2009-PC dated 15.12.2010. The budget  
allocation includes animal husbandry, dairying & fisheries schemes.

The Department had been exempted for earmarking of funds under Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) up to 2017-

However, there has been several constraints in the livestock farming in the tribal areas in India^204.  
The tribal population has insufficient pastureland for cattle rearing which led to insufficient green

fodder for animals. The milk productivity is also affected as they usually own non-descript poor  
quality animals. The ST population is usually dispersed in isolated locations. They have limited access  
to marketing infrastructure facilities and hence the households have little incentive to produce more  
milk than needed for their family consumption. Lack of knowledge about scientific animal rearing  
practices and backyard poultry rearing, particularly about feeding and economic management  
among the tribal farmers has been  
found to be a critical constraint.  
Access to credit is also a major  
problem faced by these  
communities.

As it is observed in the HH survey,  
participation of the livestock  
farmers belonging to the all  
disadvantaged groups including  
Scheduled Castes and Other  
Backward Castes in dairy  
cooperatives is similar to that of the overall participation of livestock farmers in dairy cooperatives.  
While 72% of all respondents among livestock farmers have been found to be part of dairy  
cooperatives, 73% of all livestock farmers from disadvantaged groups have participated in dairy  
cooperatives.

Adoption of innovative practices for breed improvement like Artificial Insemination (AI) is lower  
among Livestock Farmers from disadvantaged groups (including Scheduled Castes and Other  
Backward Castes) compared to the overall AI adoption. Among all respondents comprising of  
livestock farmers, 79% have adopted AI for breed improvement whereas the rate of adoption  
dropped to 68% among livestock farmers belonging to disadvantaged social groups which includes  
Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes.

It has been observed in the HH survey that the income level of all disadvantaged social groups  
including Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes have increased by 9.0%  
during the period of 2015-16 and 2018-19, while the overall income of all groups have increased by  
6.8%.

    vi. Use of IT/Technology in driving efficiency
    

Technology is disrupting all industries in the modern age and has made break-through ideas come  
into shape impacting the global social and economic growth. Productivity in the livestock sector can  
be enhanced through introduction of various technological interventions. Some of the key  
technological interventions have been discussed below.

**Animal Breed Improvement** is being done in order to enhance milk production, feed conversion  
efficiency, growth, reproduction, disease resistance. Artificial Insemination is one the most used  
technology implemented for genetic progress in the bovine population. There are around 113264 AI  
centers^205 along with 60 semen production centres and 179 frozen semen banks in the country which  
cater to 1,332.71 lakh breedable female bovines. By adopting AI technology in breeding of animals  
not only the milk productivity has been enhanced, genital and non-genital diseases in the farm stock  
has also been reduced considerably. However, in order to implement AI for all breedable bovines, the  
existing infrastructure has to be increased by at least 25%.

The genetic improvement can be further enhanced by promoting advanced technological  
interventions like, **Genome Selection, Embryo Transfer (ET)/IVF** , etc. Embryo Transfer (ET)/In-  
Vitro-Fertilization (IVF) is used to increase the reproduction rate of cows and buffaloes. The National  
Dairy Development Board (NDDB) started using ET as a tool in 1986 and established for the first time  
in the country an embryo transfer technology at Sabarmati Ashram Gaushala, Bidaj, Gujarat.  
Similarly, genomic selection technology needs to be implemented to gain higher reliability of  
pedigree bull selection.

**Hydroponic Fodder  
Production:** Hydroponic  
technology in fodder  
development ensures 98%  
reduction in water usage and is  
also more nutritious than  
conventionally grown green  
fodder. It is a suitable technology  
for low water areas and scarce  
land. In comparison to  
conventional green fodders,  
hydroponics based green  
fodders contained more crude  
protein (13.6 per cent vs 10.7 per  
cent) and less crude fibre (14.1  
per cent vs 25.9 per cent)^206.  
Hydroponic technology thus can  
result in reduced cost of farm  
input in livestock sector, fodder  
being one of the cost intensive  
inputs in livestock rearing. However, this technology requires continuous power supply to ensure  
optimum fodder production.

**Dairy Herd Management through Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology** tagging  
of animals is practiced for identification and tracking. The process is useful in verification of  
ownership, biosecurity control, record keeping, efficient farm management, registration, insurance  
and presentation of theft of animals. Electronic animal identification technologies are a growing  
trend in the livestock industry. The use of RFID for  
automation also helps in minimizing labour input,  
thus allowing each farmer to cater for more  
cows, or enabling farmers to have more time  
to spend on other activities – either way,  
maximizing results from their input. In India  
RFID tagging has started in cattle insurance  
through NABFIN^207.

RFID is used as Ear tagging in livestock for  
animal identification by NDDB has  
developed an Information Network for  
Animal Productivity & Health (INAPH).  
24,769,902 animal have been registered^208  
till November 2019. The animal identification is used for delivery of services to farmer, animal health

    Case Study on Hydroponics Technology introduction
    for Fodder Development in Tamil Nadu
    Hydroponic technology for development of fodder for
    livestock has been adopted in Tamil Nadu under National
    Agriculture Development Programme after conducting an
    intervention in a model unit in 2014-15. Hydroponic fodder
    production requires less water, less land, has very short
    growth period and results in highly nutritious feed for
    animals. It can be done across the year and is extremely
    effective in augmenting livestock productivity. The
    intervention concluded with recommendations of using
    hydroponic maize fodder replacing conventional green fodder
    for cattle without affecting its milk yield and using hydroponic
    horse gram and sun hemp fodder for calves. Through the use
    of this technology, the challenge of fodder scarcity in the
    country can be better addressed. The low cost hydroponic
    machine produces hydroponic green forage which ensures
    the nutrient requirement of livestock.

surveillance, implementation of different social welfare schemes, traceability of imported  
germplasm, and trading of livestock.

It has been seen in the HH Survey that 74% of livestock owner households have access to internet  
either through mobile phones or through broadband. Other recent studies on internet access^209 in  
India shows the rural internet penetration is around 26% as of 2017 and is expected to witness  
double digit growth for next few years. The internet penetration is estimated at individual level while  
our survey estimate is made at household level and hence shows a higher access to internet.

However in spite of having good internet penetration, use of internet for seeking information is still  
not one of the popular means among livestock farmers.

As observed from the HH survey, the analysis of the sources of information accessed by livestock  
owners shows television is the most popular source followed by information available from SHG

Box 12 : Increasing nutritional content of milk using technology

    vii. Reforms and Regulations
    

The regulatory framework of a nation is designed to take into account responses of all spheres of  
activity with respect to the changes in the economic, social and technical conditions surrounding  
them. Regulatory reforms are brought in the form of policy by the government to oversee market  
activity and ensure socio-economic efficiencies, arrest redundancies in the system and particularly

    Case Study: Increasing nutritional content of milk using technology
    

    Introduction/Challenge:
    Some of the most important constituents of milk include fat, protein, SNF, lactose and ash. It has
    been noted in various studies that cattle are not raised in ideal conditions in the country. In a
    typical cow shed, cows are tied in congested areas, fed factory-made artificial fodder, and injected
    with steroids and artificial hormones. While these lead to an increase in milk supply, it decreases
    its nutritional value. Further, most of the branded milk available in the market is pasteurised since
    not all farmers can afford in-house chilling units. However, the pasteurisation process destroys
    many vital elements such as vitamin A, B6 and B12, calcium and iodine.
    Solution:
    Acknowledging this, Dr. GNS Reddy, a veterinary expert, founded Akshayakalpa Farms and Foods
    in 2010 in Karnataka’s Tiptur district, with the aim of offering nutrient-rich milk to consumers.
    An Akshayakalpa farm comprises of 20 – 25 cows, an advanced cowshed, an automated milking
    system, fodder chopper and chilling unit, bio-gas plant and generator. The entire farm is completely
    automated. Apart from this, the focus is on the cows’ health. All cows are stress-free and have the
    freedom to graze whenever they like. Their sheds are cleaned regularly – limiting the risk of
    diseases and each cow is monitored electronically for its health and overall milk production
    regularly. The cows are fed a mix of organic fodder; monocots (maize, ragi and local jowar) and
    dicots (cow pea and velvet beans) along with tree fodder (moringa), all of which are grown
    organically by the farmers themselves. Further, all processes, from milking the cow to chilling it,
    are done through machines without the touch of a human hand, eliminating the need for
    pasteurisation completely. As a move towards sustainability, cow dung and urine are diverted to
    the biogas plant, which effectively produces enough methane gas that can operate the farm for
    eight hours every day, largely reducing the dependency on the state’s power grid, which is often
    a challenge in the rural areas.
    As of April 2018, there were 160 farmers registered with Akshayakalpa.
    Impact:
    

*   The model has brought entrepreneurial culture to agriculture – Akshayakalpa handholds  
    farmers on sourcing equipment, accessing vaccinations, and cultivating/buying fodder.
*   The farmers typically earn between Rs 40,000 – Rs 1,00,000 monthly, depending on the  
    scale of their farms.
*   The cows are healthier and stress-free, resulting in better milk production.
*   Milking machines ensure hygiene and enable better nutritional content of milk by  
    eliminating pasteurisation.

aid and medium-sized enterprises for equity. Regulatory reforms are usually implemented through  
increased level of government surveillance, deregulation, privatization or opening a market to  
increased competition. The reforms and regulations are intended to yield benefits in terms of  
reducing costs, enhancing efficiency and stimulating innovation. Some of the recent reforms in the  
agriculture and allied domain that has impacted the growth in the livestock sector in India has been  
discussed below:

**Upcoming regulations impacting livestock marketing** : The agricultural marketing is regulated  
with well-defined mechanisms for marketing infrastructure, rules and regulations. Agricultural  
marketing which also includes trade of dairy, meat, eggs as well livestock strives to ensure an efficient  
system to enable primary producers (farmers) reap maximum benefit, provide facilities for lifting all  
the produce the farmers are willing to sell, reduce the price spread between the primary producer  
and ultimate consumer, and make all products available at reasonable price to consumers. It should  
also contribute to the doubling the famers’ income by 2022-23. However, livestock market is not  
regulated across the country. Only a few states have brought marketing of livestock under  
Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act to allow trade in regulated wholesale mandis. To  
address this concern a model law Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and  
Facilitating) Act (APLM), 2017 has been drafted. The law provides wider options of selling produce  
to fetch better price includes market infrastructure for livestock trade. Under this act, states can  
create provisions for marketing infrastructure of livestock trade, facilitate alternate marketing  
channels including opening up the system to private sector as well for alternate online marketing  
platform.

**Dairy Trade Reforms** : Under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a free  
trade agreement would be made between 10 ASEAN member states and 6 FTA partners (Australia,  
China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea), including massive manufacturers like China  
which would slash import duties in all trade between the countries. This pact could impact the dairy  
industry by reducing the cost of milk and milk products. India is the largest producer of milk in the  
world and has the largest network of small dairy farmers collectivized through cooperatives. RCEP  
could potentially benefit the transnational dairy corporations from some of the largest exporters of  
dairy products by accessing India’s markets. However it would bring cheap imported dairy products  
in India and affect the interests of the local dairy farmers. Given the trade imbalance the RCEP pact  
could cause in the economy, the Government of India did not join the RCEP in the 3rd RCEP Summit  
in Bangkok^210. The decision is believed to protect the interest of 150 million dairy farmers who  
covers nearly one-quarter of Indian agricultural households. This move would also protect India’s  
growing dairy industry, which is the most remunerative farm product in India.

**Ban on Battery Cages in Poultry Subsector** : A recent draft rule under the Prohibitions of Cruelty  
to Animals (Egg Laying Hens) Rules, 2019, has laid down prohibitions of keeping hens in cramped  
‘battery cages’, use of growth promoters, and restricts the use of antibiotics for treatment purpose  
only. The rules specify the mandatory requirement of minimum 550 sq cm of floor space per bird to  
ensure reasonable space for the poultry. This regulation is expected to promote cage-free rearing,  
improve stocking density, feed, and hygiene.

    viii. Development, Dissemination & Adoption of Innovative Practices, Technology & Know-
    how
    

Some of the innovative practices which can enhance the productivity of livestock commodities as  
well make this sector remunerative for farmers in India has been discussed below:

Practice of using **Sexed Semen** in Artificial Insemination of bovines have been an effective technique  
to produce more female calves. This breakthrough technology ensures sorting of semen to produce  
more progenies of a desired sex (with about 80-90% accuracy). The sexed semen technology has  
several advantages like production of more female calves and more milk, lowered risk of  
dystocia, increased efficiency of progeny testing (PT), embryo transfer and in-vitro fertilization  
program. Sexed semen with proper management practices on dairy farms will help to grow herd  
internally with improved traits of female calves. However, high cost (Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,500^211 ) and  
reduced conception rate with sexed semen are the major hurdles in adoption of this technology^212.

Use of sexed semen in India is being done mainly through imported semen for specific breeds namely  
HF and Jersey breeds and requires approval from the State Animal Husbandry department for  
keeping complete records of progeny born out of imported semen.^213 However, very recently sexed  
semen production has started in the country in a laboratory of the Uttarakhand Livestock  
Development Board at Rishikesh under Rashtriya Gokul Mission of the Government of India^214 has  
been taken up production of sex sorted semen of various Indigenous Breeds. Production of sexed  
semen in the country is expected to cost Rs 350 and increase birth of female calf by 50%. This can  
potentially boost the industry to increase in milk supply and achieve the target of doubling the  
income of farmers. Another project for establishing sex sorted semen facility at Pune, Maharashtra  
has been approved.^215

**Embryo Transfer Technology** in animal husbandry is a powerful mechanism to improve genetic  
construction of their animal herds and increase pedigree breeds. In this technology embryo from  
collected from a donor female and are transferred to recipient females. The embryo transfer  
technique can also be used for detecting recessive traits, the production of twins in beef cows, salvage  
of genetic material from terminally ill cows or infected herds. The technology of embryo transfer has  
been benefited from the establishment of newer, more efficient procedures for the superovulation of  
donors, embryo retrieval and transfer through low-invasive methods.^216 In India, the embryo transfer  
technology is implemented by National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), under which ET  
laboratories were setup in Ahemedabad, Salon (UP), Nasik (Maharashtra), Nekarikallu (Andhra  
Pradesh) and in Central Frozen Semen Production Station and Training Institute, Hesserghatta  
(Karnataka). Under the Rashtriya Gokul Mission scheme, further strengthening of Embryo Transfer  
Technology (ETT) is being done used to create Nucleus Herd. Under the scheme it is envisaged to  
strengthen/establish 20 ETT/ IVF laboratories. It is envisaged that these ETT/IVF laboratories will

Box 13 : Producing sexed sperm for increasing milk production through RKVY funds

    Case Study: Producing sexed sperm for increasing milk production through RKVY funds
    

    Introduction/Challenge:
    The case study pertains to interventions in West Bengal using RKVY funds in 2008- 09. West Bengal
    has traditionally been a low milk producing state (producing 4.4MT in 2010-11, compared to
    13.2MT in Rajasthan, 11.2MT in Andhra Pradesh, and 6.5MT in Bihar in the same year). The state
    wished to increase its milk producing capacity to become self-sufficient, and improve dairy
    processing potential in the state.
    The actual requirement of milk was about 5.7MT, which called for an increase in per cattle milk
    production. This required targeted quantitative, qualitative and genetic improvement of cattle
    population along with strengthening of infrastructure for collection and processing of milk from the
    rural producers and marketing to the urban consumers by cooperatives, private sectors as well as
    government.
    

    Solution:
    In 2002, the Paschim Banga Go-Sampad Bikash Sanstha (PBGBS) set out to increase production
    of milk. The primary approach was to increase Artificial Insemination (AI) coverage in rural areas.
    PBGBS hence undertook production of sexed sperm by introducing ‘BD Influx High Speed Cell
    Sorter’ in the Frozen Semen Laboratory, at the Haringhata Farm. The project was taken up under
    RKVY with a total outlay of Rs. 2.90 crores, during 2007-08 and 2008–09 and completed in
    November, 2009.
    The process involved pre-determination of sex by sorting ‘X’ and ‘Y’ chromosome bearing live
    sperm cells using the DNA content of sperm as the discriminatory parameter. This helped in
    production of large number of female calves, which ultimately boosted milk production. The
    production reached 4.47MT in 2010-11, and stood at 5.38MT in 2017-18.
    

    Impact:
    

*   RKVY funding was critical in the intervention as no other scheme was functioning in the sector  
    to enable such an investment.
*   The Haringhata Farms became the breeding grounds for the birth of India’s first pre-  
    determined male calf in January 2011.
*   Sorted sexed semen is marketed in many countries like US, New Zealand, Denmark, and  
    Australia at very high prices. By replicating this technology, the animal husbandry department  
    was able to exploit the benefits of this technology at an affordable and subsidised cost.

Box 14 : Funding dairy research through innovation fund

    Case Study: Funding dairy research through innovation fund
    

    Introduction: The dairy industry is one of the largest food industries in Canada and is an
    important contributor to the country’s economy. In 2017, the industry fetched $6.56 billion in
    total net farm cash receipts and produced 89.8 million hectolitre milk. As of August 2018, there
    were 10,593 dairy farms in country. The industry is also vital for many Western and Atlantic rural
    communities. Given the importance of the sector in the country, it wishes to stay updated in
    terms of latest technology and innovative practices.
    

    The government funds its research in the sector through Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI).
    The CFI makes financial contributions to Canada’s universities, colleges, research hospitals and
    non-profit research organizations to increase their capability to carry out high-quality research.
    CFI contributes up to 40% of a project’s research infrastructure costs. Matching funds are often
    provided by provincial governments in combination with the host institution or private partners.
    Between 1998 and 2015, CFI invested in cutting-edge labs, facilities and equipment for 18 dairy
    research projects at seven universities, totalling $11.3 million. The investment is spread across
    a wide spectrum, such as, acquisition of state-of-the-art research equipment, funding for creation
    of Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods (INAF), and funding of research on the effect of
    nutrients on the metabolism of ruminants.
    

    Impact:
    

*   CFI investments in dairy infrastructure have resulted in social benefits through improved  
    animal welfare practices and food health and safety, economic benefits through improved  
    efficiency in milk and cheese processing as well as new feed research, and environmental  
    benefits through the development of sustainable practices.
*   The variety in focus of these dairy projects has resulted in the acquisition of diverse types  
    of infrastructure. The breadth of infrastructure shall advance specific areas of dairy  
    farming research.
*   A noteworthy aspect of the research projects is the interconnected networks between  
    dairy researchers and the dairy sector. In some cases, through collaborations, industry  
    partners have adopted and implemented innovative solutions developed with the CFI-  
    funded infrastructure.
*   The strong alignment of research projects with industry needs creates an ideal training  
    environment and contributes to the knowledge and skill development of the next  
    generation of researchers.
*   The availability of CFI infrastructure has enabled Canadian researchers working in dairy  
    to secure additional funding to advance their research.

    Relevance/Learnings for India:
    

    A unique and important aspect of CFI is that it enables investment from private players, and the
    governments. This ensures that the government does not bear 100% of the cost of research
    funds. It also ensures that the research is relevant to industry requirement. Creation of a
    dedicated research fund, with collaboration from multiple parties can support research in Indian
    animal husbandry and dairy sector.

    ix. Stakeholder and Beneficiary Behavioral Change
    

Animal husbandry requires healthy rearing of animals with proper care given for prevention of  
diseases, development of superior germplasm leading to higher productivity of animals (in terms of  
milk and meat). It is also important to assess the impact of increasing inputs for productivity  
enhancement on environment and take sustainable measures.

In the dairy sector, increase in profitability along with ensuring it as a sustainable venture can be  
promoted among the dairy farmers by adopting healthy practices at optimum costs. It is critical to  
impact knowledge to animal rearers on the basic tenets of animal health, breeding and feeding.  
Several ongoing schemes like National Dairy Plan-I, Rashtriya Gokul Mission, Livestock Health and  
Disease Control, Assistance to Animal Health Institutes focus on the aspects of increasing  
productivity while ensuring prevention of diseases. Several of these schemes focus on increasing  
artificial insemination using disease free semen from high genetic merit bulls and at the same time  
optimizing the utilization of feed resources in order to reduce the cost of milk production through  
balancing the ration of animals. Most of the schemes cover aspects of training and sensitizing farmers  
on the best practices of animal husbandry. In order to provide information on breeding healthcare,  
management, nutrition, fodder production etc. based on existing and new technologies; National  
Dairy Development Board has published the Handbook of Good Dairy Husbandry Practices for  
farmers^217. The comprehensive manual consists of information and recommendations on bovine  
health and breeding, bovine nutrition and animal information network for better productivity.

    x. Research and Development
    

Research priorities in the livestock sector focuses on the enhancement of livestock productivity,  
which leads to a more efficient utilization of available resources and translates into economic  
development both at the household and national levels. The strategies undertaken to bring  
improvement in production should also result in a more efficient and sustainable use of natural  
resources. The selected strategies should include increasing feed and residue yields from crops  
grown on farmlands, arrest losses from disease and improving the genetic potential for milk and meat  
yields of animals. These improvements also should have positive consequences for long-term  
sustainability - both environmental and economic. The research areas in this sector prioritizes on the  
following areas: feed supply, animal health, genetic improvement, livestock management, livestock  
farming systems, natural resources and policy.

Some of the key research institutes in livestock management in India are National Dairy Institute,  
Indian Veterinary Research Institute, National Institute of Animal Nutrition and Physiology,  
Bengaluru, ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal along with National  
Research Centres on various animals and Veterinary & Animal Science Universities. Under the  
Department of Agricultural Research and Education, Indian Council of Agricultural Research  
conducts various research in animal science to increase productivity and double farmer’s income.  
Some of the critical research strategies taken up by the institute include improvement of indigenous  
cattle breeds and poultry, prevention of livestock diseases in the country and capacity building of  
human resources in livestock science. There has been registrations of around 184 indigenous breeds

of animals and poultry in the country^218 including 43 of cattle, 16 of buffalo, 34 of goat, 43 of sheep, 7  
of horses and ponies, 9 of camel, 8 pig, 2 of donkey, 1 of yak, 19 of chicken, 1 of duck, and 1 of geese.  
Some of the recent developments in research by ICAR includes the following achievements:

*   Selection in indigenous breeds like Gir, Kankrej and Sahiwal improved the average age at first  
    calving, lactation days, lactation length, and peak yield.
*   Development of Himsamridhi - a backyard poultry breed suitable for hilly areas.
*   Development and facilitation of dairy farmers “Forewarning Mobile Application” to extend  
    the reach of National Animal Disease Referral Expert System which provides forewarning  
    report for 13 economically important livestock diseases in the country.

Under the livestock improvement researches^219 , there has been significant effort in breed  
improvement through selection of indigenous breeds of cattle along with conducting network project  
on buffalo improvement.

*   Efforts on genetic improvement of breeds of sheep and goat through selective breeding are  
    being pursued in various agro-climatic zones. In order to improve the quality and availability  
    of animal feed, research is being conducted around profiling bio-geography of gut microbes  
    of all ruminants including cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goat.
*   Under this domain, alternative feed sources from modified hydroponically developed mould-  
    free sprouts on local crop residue bedding has been developed to supplement the animal feed  
    in a cost effective way. Supplementation of cattle feed through adding by-products of  
    silkworm pupae has been evaluated in crossbred cattle and has been concluded to be  
    beneficial in enhancing the nutrition utilization. There has been diverse studies in feed  
    management of other animals like buffalo, camel, pigs, mithun and poultry.
*   ICAR-Central Institute has pursued artificial insemination in bovines on Research in Cattle by  
    collecting frozen semen of indigenous and cross breeds for utilization of farm animals.  
    Fertility prediction models in cattle and buffalo have been developed which have shown high  
    accuracy for selection of superior quality semen facilitating high conception rates.
*   Research around genetic disease detection and screening, drug resistance in animals,  
    evaluation of udder health and milk quality are being extensively pursued.

The development and application of new innovative methods are disseminated through trials,  
frontline demonstrations with farmers and practitioners. In 2018-19, ICAR has conducted 656  
technology interventions across 842 locations covering 6818 trials on animals under the thematic  
areas of disease management, evaluation of breeds, feed and fodder management, nutrition  
management, production management and processing. Demonstrations of fodder crop production  
on berseem, maize, sorghum and napier grass has been conducted on farmers’ land.

ICAR in its future endeavours intends to pursue research in the frontier areas like stem cells,  
pharmacokinetics and nutrigenomics, transgenic animals, proteome analysis, SIRNA technology, bio-  
sensor applications, targeted nano-delivery of drugs and IVF-ETT.^220 Some of the critical areas of  
investigation and research identified in the Vision 2050 of ICAR include livestock genetic  
improvement using phenomics, genomics and bioinformatics tools; breeding transgenic animals  
capable of producing tailor-made milk/ meat to cater to the specific needs; understanding of the basis  
of genetic resistance in domestic species of livestock with DNA markers for disease-resistant genes.  
Livestock feed, healthcare and management are to be addressed in an integrated manner. Changes in  
livestock production, increase the potential for new pathogens to emerge, grow and spread from  
animals to humans on a global scale. Effective phytosanitary and animal health regimes aided by new  
vaccines, diagnostic products and tools, and epidemiological information are necessary to survive in  
the emerging regulatory regime.^221

    xi. Impact on and Role of Private Sector, Community/ Collectives/ Cooperatives and Civil
    Society
    

The dairy sector contributes significantly to rural income nearly 26% in case of the poorest  
households and 12% for overall rural income. For the marginal and even landless farmer, livestock  
is a source of income as well as ensures nutritional security of the family.

**Cooperatives and SHGs for milk production**

Dairy cooperatives and farmer producer organizations have been able to collectivize the small and  
marginal livestock farmers to form an autonomous enterprise. This platform offers economies of  
scale in the dairy produce and helps them market the dairy products (milk or processed milk  
products) at a competitive price. The dairy value chain thus formed by the cooperative/FPO manages  
milk procurement, processing & marketing. The socio-economic benefits derived from the FPO  
formation impacts in improving farmers' income, ensuring women empowerment, generating  
employment and increase access to credit.

In India, about 52% of the milk produced is available for sale to organised and un-organised players  
involved in sale and marketing of milk and dairy products.^222 The cooperative organised sector in  
India follows a three-tier structure with village cooperatives societies at the core. 210 dairy  
cooperative unions covering 1,90,516 village level cooperative societies and 16.93 million farmers  
are active in the country. These cooperatives have reported a sale of 354.53 lakh litres per day in  
2018 - 19. Summary tables on region-wise number of cooperative societies operational in India, total  
number of members and overall milk procurement in 2018-19 are given below^223.

North zone comprising of states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Himachal  
Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir leads in terms of no. of registered milk cooperative societies (66,355).  
UP, Bihar and Gujarat are top three states in India in terms of number of registered societies. States  
in Southern Zone (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) lead in terms of  
total number of members in societies while states in West Zone lead in terms of total procurement.  
However, the high number of milk cooperatives and large membership is not an indicator of success  
as can be seen from the chart below^224.

UP and Bihar, which are the top two states in terms of registered number of cooperatives societies  
but have reported very low procurement of 403 and 1891 TLPD. State of Gujarat has the highest  
procurement of 22,920 TLPD it is important to note that overall milk procurement through  
cooperatives is heavily skewed towards Gujarat as daily procurement in Gujarat alone is almost  
equals to daily procurement from North, East and South Zone. Comparison of data across multiple  
states shows that increasing number of dairy societies may not translate into required results. Good  
infrastructure, better marketing and processing facilities are necessary perquisites for boosting milk  
procurement and development of robust dairy sector.

In addition to the dairy cooperatives, NDDB Dairy Services (NDS), wholly-owned subsidiary of NDDB,  
is facilitating incorporation of milk producer companies. Presently there are 14 milk producing  
companies spread over 11,920 villages, comprising of over four lakh members^225. These producer  
companies procure 26 lakh kg of milk per day. Out of these 14 milk producing companies, six are  
being supported under National Dairy Plan (NDP), five are getting support from Tata Trusts and  
remaining three are being supported by NRLM/SRLM.

In addition to the cooperatives, multiple private players engaged in procurement of processing of  
milk have evolved. These companies usually procure milk through middlemen which affects the price  
remuneration to farmers.

It has been observed in the HH Survey analysis that around 72% of the livestock farmers are part of  
a dairy cooperative. The graph below depicts the rate of participation in dairy cooperatives among  
livestock farmers.

Further analysis of the survey reveals the popular services being availed by the livestock farmers  
who are member of a cooperative.

The percentage of dairy cooperative members availing various services such as milk collection,  
veterinary services, feed, artificial insemination and other services from the cooperatives have been

Box 15 : Resolving issue of fodder supply in dairy sector through women FPO

    Case Study: Resolving issue of fodder supply in dairy sector through women FPO
    

    Introduction/Challenge:
    

    The scarcity of green fodder posed as one of the major hindrances for achieving sustainable
    livelihood through dairy-bases activities in a small village named Lata in Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand.
    The community was entirely dependent on forests for its fodder supply. Given that women
    dominate the dairy sector in India, it was difficult for them (women) to fetch fodder from far-off
    forest areas on a regular basis. This deterred the village women from taking up dairying as a
    business activity.
    

    Solution:
    

    In the year 2012-13, the model focussed on bringing together women producers, who were
    dependent on traditional income sources as the scale of economies from the dairy sector was at
    subsistence level.
    Given that fodder is a critical input for the dairy sector, the village women were organized to form
    five producer groups (FPOs). The groups sought to resolve the issue of fodder scarcity by
    collectively cultivating green grass fodder in the ‘van panchayat’ land. The 48-member group of
    Lata village collectively started the cultivation of green fodder, which was able to fulfil the village’s
    fodder requirement to a great extent (from the initial 3 tonnes to 9 tonnes in a season). The groups
    were assisted by the veterinary department in the creation of infrastructure, such as fencing and
    land development, to upscale the commercial fodder activity.
    The women’s dairy cooperative received recognition from the district administration, and the
    veterinary department was awarded Rs. 50,000 for this innovation. The women dairy producers
    were also helped by other line departments — with machinery and equipment — to upscale the
    dairy sector.
    

    Impact:
    

*   The collective commercial production of perennial grass on van panchayat land provided an  
    additional income to the dairy producers.
*   This also increased milk production, further leading to an increase in dairy farmers’ income.
*   As of 2013, the dairy producers were able to earn Rs. 20,000-30,000 annually from the  
    commercial cultivation of fodder and Rs. 1,000-1,200 a month from the sale of fresh milk.
*   The organization of women as dairy producer groups paved the way for business development  
    services (BDS) and helped them move the activities to business levels.
*   Cultivation of fodder on fallow van panchayat land led to reduction in intensity of soil erosion,  
    specifically during the monsoon season.

### 1.3 Issues and Challenges

Some of the key issues and challenges that impact the development of the sector including improved  
productivity and restrict income of farmers from livestock rearing include a host of animal  
management practices such as effective control of animal diseases, shortage of feed and fodder, breed  
improvement while preserving diverse genetic resources and dissemination of technology, skills and  
quality services to farmers, etc. These issues and challenges have been elaborated below.

**Lack of Resources:** Resources allocated to sector have not been proportional to the contribution of  
the sector to the agriculture and allied sector economy. Over the years, less than five per cent of the  
total financial resources allocated to the agriculture and allied sector have been allocated to the  
livestock sector. This has resulted in inadequate human resource deployment as well. These have  
limited the sector to achieve a much higher growth.

**Low Productivity of Milch Animals:** The factors that impede higher productivity are genetic  
potential, shortage of feed, poor understanding of animal health, inadequate health care facilities,  
inadequate breeding infrastructure and lack of extension activities to build the capacities of farmers.

Improvement of genetic varieties of cattle and buffaloes also requires recognition of local breeds and  
prioritization by their economic importance. Practices like progeny testing and pedigree recording  
are largely absent.

In addition to the challenge of low productivity, there is also the issue of the sharp inter-state  
variations in the yield of dairy animals. The interstate variations in milk yield is prevalent in  
crossbred cows, indigenous cows as well as buffaloes. The total milk productivity from all dairy  
animals including crossbred cows, indigenous cows, buffaloes and goats across all states shows  
substantial variations as depicted in the graph below:

Figure 138 : Interstate Variations in Milk Productivity

Retrieved from [http://dahd.nic.in/](http://dahd.nic.in/)

18 states have milk productivity lower than the national average productivity. In agriculturally  
underdeveloped states, although farmers are more dependent on livestock, the milk productivity is

generally observed to be low.^226 Improvement of productivity of milch animals in these low yield  
states are required since they account for major share in the total milk production. The feeding  
pattern^227 of cattle and buffaloes have a direct relation with increase in productivity of milk along  
with the factor of herd size. A larger herd size is observed to have a higher milk yield owing to better  
management of animals by the larger farmers.

**Lack of Real Time MIS and Database:** The sector lacks a comprehensive Centralised MIS system for  
smooth monitoring of various interventions being undertaken by the Government as also a better  
analysis of information to monitor the performance of the sector. Databases are either not present or  
there are no interlinkages and as such function in isolation. There is a need to develop to create  
databases on various sub-sector and components/activities therein and develop a mechanism to link  
these databases for analysis and mid-course corrections to be undertaken if any.

**Lack of Registered Livestock Markets** : Livestock markets in India are neither organized nor  
regulated markets, though some states have brought marketing of livestock under Agriculture  
Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act.^228

There are about 2,000 markets for live animals, falling under the jurisdiction of state governments  
and managed by local bodies such as Municipal Corporations and Gram Panchayats. Most of these  
markets are irregular, lack transparency in transactions and are short of basic infrastructure,  
marketing facilities, transportation facilities and other basic facilities like housing for animals, etc.  
Additionally, in some states the livestock and livestock products are not notified commodities^229.

It has been observed from the HH Survey, that only 7.9% of the livestock farmers are aware of a  
nearby market for Sale and purchase of livestock products.

The draft model law Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitating) Act  
(APLM), 2017 provides wider options of selling livestock to fetch better prices and includes market  
infrastructure for livestock trade^230. The Model Act can be supplemented through facilitation of  
alternate marketing channels including opening up the system to private sector as well for alternate  
online marketing platform. Inclusion of livestock trade under this Act can help the current  
situation^231.

**Limitation in Animal Healthcare Services** : There is an urgent need to strengthen the health  
infrastructures catering to animals and poultry in the country. Currently, there are around 65,815  
veterinary institutions in the country each of which caters to 5071 livestock units, totalling to 330.84  
million livestock, against population of 535.82 million in the country.

The poor status of animal healthcare system is attributed to the inefficiencies in provision of curative  
health services and limited attention towards preventive health system. In the case of curative health  
services, a large gap also exists between the need and the availability of animal health service  
providers for cows and buffaloes. This has led to farmers opting for local alternatives such as  
untrained personnel or self-medication, which often results in more harm than good.

The veterinary services also do not cover costs of the medicines which has to be borne by farmers.  
An estimated 85% of the annual non-planned state budgets are spent on salaries and other  
establishment cost, leaving relatively lower funds for drugs and vaccines.^232

In the HH Survey, a similar picture is observed in terms of animal healthcare services availed by  
livestock farmers. Around 70% of livestock farmers have vaccinated their animals. The vaccination  
rate is much higher among scheme beneficiaries. The graph below shows the comparative analysis  
of scheme beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries vaccination rate. This further implies that there  
remains a huge scope to improve vaccination services.

Among scheme beneficiaries more than 90% are reaching out to Community Health Workers or Dairy  
Cooperatives or Extension Support Veterinarians. However, among eligible non beneficiaries, around  
52% are getting their livestock treated at home or reaching out to relatives and other local sources  
including private veterinarians. The practices of availing treatment is evidently poorer among  
eligible non-beneficiaries and it shows that the beneficiaries have much better access to animal  
health services. This highlights that the animal health services need to be strengthened further.

**Livestock Insurance and Access to Credit:** Livestock insurance is a critical aspect for protecting  
the livestock assets of the farmers against vulnerabilities and diseases. However, the penetration of  
livestock insurance is very low at less than 7% of cattle population^233. As per the Government of India,  
14.80 lakh animals were insured in 2014-15 which declined to 7.65 lakh in 2015-16 and 7.44 lakh in  
2016 - 17234.

The livestock insurance sector faces issues such as high operational costs, difficulties in verification  
of claims, high insurance premiums and lack of awareness about products.

Along with the issue of livestock insurance, lack of credit in the livestock sector is also expressed as  
one of the top 3 issues faced by livestock beneficiaries as analyzed in the HH Survey. The graph below  
shows around 41% livestock farmers have expressed lack of credit to buy new animals is one of the  
key problems faced by the farmers. The high cost of concentrated feed was seen as the top=most  
problem by most respondents.

**Inefficiency in Extension Services** : The extension services in the livestock sector is weak. The state  
departments have limitations in terms of resources for effective coverage of extension activities and  
also in many instances lack expertise to operate technology transfer packages.

The current institutional arrangement has mixed extension activities with curative activities,  
wherein, the focus is on providing information on animal health care and breeding at the expense of  
information dissemination on feeding and management practices which also are important  
components of livestock productivity.

**Access to Infrastructure:** The livestock sector suffers a post-harvest loss of 0.92% – 7.19% which is  
largely due to inefficiencies of processing and inadequate post-harvest processing, storage and  
distribution facilities.

In the dairy sector, around 40% of milk produced is processed either in cooperative or private sector.  
Most of the processing facilities in the cooperative sector have been established during Operation  
Flood period (1970-1996) and have not been expanded or modernized thereafter.

It is expected that milk producer institutions would procure 670 lakh kg per day with peak of 800  
lakh kg per day by 2021- 22235. Compared with processing level of milk in developed country which  
is pegged at 90%, there is huge scope to increase the processing of milk through organized sector  
and also utilize the surplus for various milk products like butter, clarified butter, cheese, skimmed  
milk powder which has a longer shelf life.

Similarly, the meat industry also requires establishment of modern abattoirs for clean and hygienic  
meat processing. There are 1,783 registered slaughter houses in the country^236 and nearly 78% of  
them are concentrated in 8 states^237 , thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen the slaughter houses.  
The processing level of meat is also low at 1% of the total meat produced in the country^238.

**Shortage of Feed and Fodder** : The major factor that affects the livestock sector is the shortage and  
increasing cost of animal feed and fodder. The year-wise trend in the feed cost of livestock is shown  
below:

Availability of fodder and feed both in terms of quantity and quality is a major constraint. The area  
under fodder crops has stagnated at about 8.5 to 9 million hectares. Expected shortfall in demand for  
Dry, Green and Concentrates is 11%, 35% and 45% respectively. Overall, the deficit of feed and  
fodder in the country is as high as 57%^239 and increasing. It is also becoming a challenge due to the  
constant trade-off between cultivation for human food and fodder in the farmland. The feed and  
fodder shortage is more acute in the dry states with limited rainfall. It is anticipated that feed balance  
may worsen further as production of green fodder is projected to decline by 2030^240.

The pasture lands in India are overgrazed and not properly managed which lead to lower  
productivity. In many states the grazing pressure is very high compared to carrying capacity with  
70% of grazing land falling in poor and very poor condition.

In the HH Survey the grazing practices of livestock farmers has been analyzed. As per the analysis,  
around 61 % of livestock farmers are found to practice zero grazing which is comparatively a better  
and sustainable practice. The graph shown below shows the share of different grazing practices taken  
up by farmers.^241

Fertilization of grazing land is  
not practiced by most of the  
livestock farmers. As observed  
from the HH Survey, around  
73% of livestock farmers who  
have been practicing grazing of  
animals do not fertilize the  
grazing land.

In addition to the above issues,  
there is a supply-demand gap  
in respect of quality forage  
seeds as well. There is a need to  
increase the productivity of

The lack of feed and fodder has also been expressed as a critical issue by beneficiaries. As observed  
in the HH Survey, two of the top 3 issues faced by livestock beneficiaries are around feed and fodder  
as shown in the Figure 141 : Top Issues of Livestock Farmers. Around 68% of respondents among  
livestock farmers expressed cost of concentrate feed as the top issue followed by 54% of respondents  
mentioning low quality of fodder as the 2 nd most critical issue.

**Lack of focus on Integrated Animal Management Systems** : The development efforts in the sector  
have primarily been on increasing production and productivity and not on management of resources.  
As a result, many aspects have either received attention in isolation or have just been ignored. Animal  
management practices have largely been left from the development efforts. Practices on systemized  
management of animal health, nutrition packages, animal hygiene, manure management etc. have  
largely been ignored.

As observed from the HH Survey, it has been found training on breeding such as training on heat  
detection is very low. The analysis of training on heat detection has been depicted below which shows  
slight increase among scheme beneficiaries than eligible non-beneficiaries.

Box 16 : Dairy Industry of New Zealand

    Case Study on Dairy Industry of New Zealand
    Background
    New Zealand is the eight largest milk producing country in the world and accounts for 2.6% of global milk
    production by producing 21.3 million tonnes in 2017. New Zealand produces a similar amount of milk to
    other temperate countries of a similar size (e.g. the UK, France). However, as it only has a small population
    (similar to Singapore), the excess is exported. The country is world's largest exporter of milk and dairy
    products, accounting for a fifth of the global total at $5.4 billion in 2018, according to the International
    Trade Centre. New Zealand is the world’s leading exporter of butter, whole milk powder and products of
    natural milk constituents (such as the protein casein), the second largest exporter of skimmed milk
    powder, and the sixth largest exporter of infant formula. Dairy products from New Zealand are exported
    to over 140 countries with China being the largest market, followed by United States. The success of New
    Zealand in dairy is attributed to various factors. The dairy industry in the country is built around a natural
    environment conducive to agriculture. The dairy collection model is a natural monopsony with all milk
    collection and primary processing through farmer owned cooperatives. About 84% of New Zealand milk
    supply is controlled by Fonterra, a farmer-owned cooperative which was formed in 2001 in a megamerger
    of dairy cooperatives and the export dairy board.
    Key Drivers
    The key drivers of New Zealand’s dairy industry that have ensured success are:
    

*   Conducive climate with ensuring low production cost: The temperate climate has allowed  
    development of grass-fed production system at low cost
*   Efficient people skilled in dairy management: With a long history of dairy production of over 100  
    years, the industry boasts of highly skilled personnel and strong dairy management system
*   Location and proximity to global markets: The country enjoys a privilege in terms of its location  
    and connection with East & South-East Asian market  
    The expansion of export markets required the dairy industry of New Zealand to strengthen its  
    infrastructure, improve its processing capacities, transportation upgrading of port facilities, and the  
    expansion of shipping provided by transnational shipping firms such as Maersk. These steps were taken  
    alongside doubling the milk production over 15 years since 2000. Increase in milk production was done  
    by increasing dairy farmland by 74% and dairy cows by 65%. Conversions of sheep and beef farms into  
    dairy farms had to be done which required significant investment in re-construction. Alongside, fodder  
    production had to be increased by planting maize crops as well as procurement of supplement such as  
    palm kernel meal from Indonesia and Malaysia. Dairy farm being more labour intensive than sheep or beef  
    cattle farms, employed migrant labour in the country’s dairy industry. The successful dairy model of New  
    Zealand showcases how dairy farming can leverage the opportunities presented by globalization by  
    assembling several factors in the competitive environment. Being an export-oriented industry from the  
    beginning, the industry explored new geographies to expand which was coupled with building Fonterra to  
    support the humongous milk supply.  
    **Learnings for India**  
    New Zealand dairy development model has some lessons for Indian dairy sector – global market oriented  
    production and manufacturing facilities, emphasis on all aspects of the industry and not just production to  
    bring efficiency across the value chain and explore appropriate low-cost innovations to tap export markets.

Chapter 2: Sector Level Recommendation: Animal Husbandry

### 2.1 Recommendations at Sectoral Level

Post consultations with the department officials at central, state and district level; sector experts;  
and our analysis of the issues and challenges faced by the Livestock sector, the recommendations  
and solutions have been provided below across the Value Chain. The investments need to be  
mobilized from public and private resources wherein the private sector is expected to invest in  
processing, value addition, and marketing and public investment needs to be made to make  
production cost competitive and reduce involved input cost. The input cost would be reduced  
through disease control, better nutrition, and breed improvement, which will lead to increase in  
investment from private sector.

**Production**

*   In India, the growth in milk production has largely been due to large number of milch  
    animals as compared to developed economies such as Israel, USA, Korea, etc., where the  
    average yield rate of animals is much higher than India. For example, the average yield  
    rate of milch animals is much higher in  
    some of the other countries such as Israel  
    (36.11Kg/day), USA (28.65 Kg/day),  
    Republic of Korea (27.49 Kg/day)^242 as  
    against 4.5 Kg/ day in India. This leads to  
    high pressure on resources such as land  
    for fodder and grazing, animal housing,  
    etc. This also leads to a higher carbon  
    footprint. Considering the resource  
    scarcity in India, there is a need to  
    increase productivity significantly to  
    encourage “technology-driven livestock  
    economy” as against “animal population-  
    driven livestock economy”. Examples of  
    some of the technologies which are being  
    used are:  
    o Use of bio-sensors and machine-to-  
    machine technology to continuously  
    automatically monitor health  
    productivity and reproduction of  
    livestock  
    o AI and the use of sexed semen  
    o Hydroponics to increase fodder prod.  
    o Balanced diet including ration balancing, feeding of Azolla, etc. for improved nutrition  
    o Use of milk bacteria analyser which allows farmers or milk testing laboratories to take fast  
    action to preserve and enhance milk quality. It also helps to diagnose udder diseases at an  
    early stage leading to faster treatment and recovery.

FAO Statistics

    Example of USA: More Milk from Fewer Cows
    1944 : Production – 53 Mn MT from 25.6 Mn Cows
    2007 : Production - 84 Mn MT (+60%) from 9.2 Mn
    Cows (-64%)
    How: This was achieved primarily through technology
    induction for improving genetic capacity for
    production, better nutrition and improved cow health.
    Impact:
    About 41% reduction in total carbon footprint
    associated with milk production
    Reduction in Resource Use to produce the same
    amount of milk as in 1944 (53 mil. metric tons), the
    U.S. dairy industry uses:
    

*   10% of the land
*   23% of the feedstuffs by weight
*   35% of the water  
    Per litre of milk:
*   Making 75% less manure and
*   Creating 57% less methane.  
    **Learnings for India:**  
    Focus on breed improvement, technology, health and  
    nutrition can lead to more efficient and environment  
    friendly milk production.

*   Considering the scarcity of land in the country, many times different departments come  
    in conflict with each other as all of them have their own targets in terms of land use. For  
    example, Departments of Forest, Revenue, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, etc., all have  
    their own targets of increasing the land use for their respective activities. These targets  
    are mostly set by the respective departments individually without consultations with the  
    other concerned departments. It is imperative to involve all these departments at the  
    planning stage itself (at state and district levels) to set the targets which would be  
    practically achievable without least overlaps and optimizing resource use. This will also  
    help optimize the trade-off between cultivation for human food and fodder in the  
    farmland.
*   Gram panchayats may be incentivized to hand over land areas with grazing rights,  
    cultivable fallow lands to FPO/ cooperatives/ private individuals with proper support and  
    training for preparation of silage and hay. The fodder may then be sold to the local dairy  
    farmers at a cost plus basis ensuring sustainability of the project. This will also help in  
    ameliorating the feed/ fodder shortage during the dry season.
*   Similarly, barren/ non-cultivable lands may be leased out by the panchayat to FPOs/  
    cooperatives/ private individuals for setting up of low investment hydroponic based  
    fodder production systems.
*   Crop stubble has become a perennial problem for the environment. The stubble, if treated  
    properly can be used as a minor component of the fibre portion of animal feed.
*   One of the major constraints in transfer of hay over large distances is the low bulk density  
    of the fodder. Baling solutions customized to Indian environment will address the  
    shortage of fodder in fodder deficient states due to increased transportability.
*   Unconventional protein sources like mesquites (crushed _Keekar_ seeds) have been used  
    on a semi commercial basis in drier states such as Rajasthan by certain agri start-ups.  
    Promoting such non-conventional resources especially in arid and semi-arid areas will  
    reduce the cost of protein as a nutrient, increasing milk quantity while reducing cost of  
    production.
*   The efficacy of hydroponic (which is generally capital intensive) in green fodder  
    production has been established by the private sector where land is scarce. However, low-  
    cost hydroponics solutions are now also available in the sector. There are several  
    advantages of hydroponic fodder production which include requirement of less water and  
    land, short growth period, higher nutrition and round the year production^243. An example  
    of low cost hydroponics is being undertaken by some farmers associated with the Dairy  
    Industry in Phaltan Taluka in Satara district of Maharashtra. An ICAR study undertaken  
    in 2013 revealed that there was an increase in milk yield by 0.5-2.5 litres per animal per  
    day apart from increase in fat and SNF content, improvement in health and conception  
    rate, reduction in cattle feed requirement by 25%, increase in sweetness of the milk,  
    whiter milk, reduction in labour cost, requirement of less space and water when

    hydroponics fodder is used.^244 The Government of India may consider incentivising this
    type of technologies under Public Private Community Partnership (PPCP) or any other
    relevant model to overcome shortage of fodder and limit conflict on land use.
    

*   Another mechanism that can be considered is the promotion of algae cultivation including  
    Azolla as demonstrated by some initiatives in Rajasthan, Kerala, etc. Azolla is rich in  
    proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin B12, Beta Carotene), growth  
    promoter intermediaries and minerals including calcium, phosphorous, iron, potassium,  
    ferrous, copper, magnesium, etc. Several studies have concluded that Azolla is a highly  
    suitable aquatic plant for livestock feed due to its ease of cultivation, nutritive value and  
    high productivity.^245 Hence, it is a highly efficient and economic feed substitute for  
    livestock, especially due to its high protein and low lignin content which makes it easily  
    digestible for the livestock.^246 Certain trials have found an increase in milk yield  
    when Azolla was combined with regular commercial feed leading to savings of 20-25%.^247

Box 88 : Dairying in Israel

    Case Study on Dairying in Israel
    Introduction: The experiments in dairy farming were initiated in Israel in 1910 when there were
    only about 1000 cattle in the country. While cross breeding efforts started in 1920s, the increased
    importance of dairy farming resulted in focus on cattle health and eradication of diseases in 1930s.
    This improved the production and by the end of 1940s Israel had more than 33,000 cows with 75
    million litres of milk production. In 1956, Israeli dairy board was formed to promote exports and
    organise dairying in the country. Israel has two farming systems: The Kibbutz and the Moshav.
    Kibbutz are large farm collective units, whereas Moshav are family herds organised as cooperative
    society.
    Challenges: The unfavourable climatic conditions, desert conditions, heat, humidity, endemic
    diseases and limited land & water resources poses challenge in rearing and maintenance of cows.
    Solution: Dairying is much organised in Israel with focus on cattle health, Hygiene and nutrition.
    Region specific nutrition strategy is developed based on the climatic conditions and energy needs
    of cows. Proper management of feed is seen as critical for maintaining body weight and sustained
    milk production. Feed management by maintaining forage and storing silage also form important
    part of feeding strategy. For better health and productivity, balanced energy rich diet through a
    mixture of wheat, barley, sorghum rice and other grains is provided. Sufficient intake of fat rich
    diet (upto 6%) through cottonseed, brewer grain and oilseeds are ensured for lactating cows. Fresh
    forage act as an important source of vitamins and minerals. Israeli dairy board and associated
    institutions also supports and publishes research and paper on nutrition & feeding and region
    specific feeding strategies are consistently updated on the basis of the findings. Herd diet is based
    on scientific, online feed analysis, for highest nutritional value and economic efficiency. Herd
    management, disease control and strong veterinary services are at the core of the dairy industry
    success in Israel. This are complemented by genetic improvement measures and AI support,
    training on heat detection, proper practices on calf rearing. The Israeli herd book contains
    information of about 90% dairy cows in the country. The health details, production and other
    aspects of cows are consistently recorded and analysed in Israeli dairy farms.
    Impact:
    

*   Highest per cow milk production annually in the world at 11,970 Kg (3.75% Fat, 3.45%  
    protein)
*   Improved milk quality with reduced somatic and bacterial count per unit reduced by more  
    than 50% since 1999
*   Average milk yield per cow is tripled since 1940, yield has been consistently above 10,000  
    kg per year since 1995  
    **Learnings for India**
*   Region specific balanced diet plan needs to be developed for Buffaloes and Cows.
*   Silage making and forage management practices needs to be encouraged
*   Strengthening of health services and hygiene has immediate impact on health and  
    productivity of cattle
*   Awareness building and training among producers on importance of right diet, proper  
    drinking water and hygiene in rearing of cattle can be encouraged
*   Dairy herd nutrition management studies from Israel shows that increasing proportion of  
    high energy foods in ration can be counterproductive for production and yield as it may  
    reduce pH value, impact metabolism. The diet needs to be a balance between forage and  
    fibrous structure

    184
    

**Processing and Value Addition**

*   Promotion of modern technologies like IQF, spiral freezers for enhancing the shelf life  
    (even up to 1 year) of other milk products (canned rasgulla/ gulab jamuns) like kalakand,  
    milk cakes, burfis, etc. and maintain freshness of these products. These kind of products  
    would also be suitable for export markets catering to the Indian diaspora settled abroad.
*   Efforts should be made for the scaling up of the small scale model of dairy farming at  
    village level through a collective approach, wherein several individuals who own 2- 3  
    animals can be come together and increase their herd strength up to 40-50 animals. The  
    farms can be set up on the panchayat land or any other common land, where additional  
    infrastructural facilities such as milking machines, milk chillers, etc. can be installed for  
    achieving economies of scale and better socio-economic status of milk producers. For  
    example, a community dairy farm has been operational in Uttar Pradesh with  
    involvement of business incubators, social venture capital fund and community. The  
    activities undertaken are dairy farm to house cattle of the members, mechanised milking  
    unit, chilling plant, fodder stores and veterinary services. Moreover, the cattle sourcing,  
    fodder management and cattle health are managed professionally. Similar initiatives may  
    be promoted through a replicable and scalable model.

**Insurance and Credit**

Livestock plays an important productive asset in rural economy, especially for small and marginal  
farmers in India. Increasing livestock population and intensive rearing practices expose livestock  
to risk of diseases and shortage of fodder. Diseases can lead to productivity losses and even death.  
Livestock insurance can play an important role in risk mitigation for livestock owners by  
providing security from financial losses due to death and disability of productive livestock.

In India, organised cattle insurance was initiated in 1971 through Small Farmers Development  
Agency. In 1983, cattle insurance was provided for poor at subsidized rates through Integrated  
Rural Development Program (IRDP)^248 ; in the same year livestock insurance was also being  
provided as per General Insurance Council (GIC) guidelines under market agreement. The initial  
intake was very low due to high premium, therefore, the premium was reduced to encourage  
intake but the coverage remained low with slight improvements^249. The insurance industry was  
liberalised in 1999 and in 2001 private players entered market. A key reform was introduced in

*   It is important to note that Israel has different climatic conditions and very small  
    geographical area and 100% of cattle are stall fed. Therefore, Indian strategy needs to  
    be developed based on India local conditions and different strategy may be developed  
    for stall fed animals and grazing animals.
*   To prevent indigestion and toxins, it is important to minimize humidity while storing and  
    transporting food and silage
*   Millets (Barley, Sorghum etc), maize, alfalfa and oilseeds are important sources of  
    nutrition and these crops may be promoted in addition to wheat in integrated farming  
    systems

2003 when cattle insurance was freed from market agreements and the insurance companies  
were given flexibility in deciding premium and policy conditions. Further reforms were  
introduced in 2005 with introduction of micro insurance regulation act which encouraged  
involvement of NGOs, MFIs and SHGs as insurance provider. Subsequently, Livestock Insurance  
Scheme was launched in 2006 - first implemented in 100 districts and later extended to other  
areas. In 2014, livestock insurance became an integral part of National Livestock Mission as a risk  
mitigation measure.

Livestock insurance has been around for nearly 50 years and has gone through several  
transformations. Yet, the coverage of livestock insurance remains very poor at less than 7% of  
total cattle population^250. More than 90% are compulsory credit linked products and only 10%  
sold through direct sales, despite the fact that most of the schemes subsidize livestock insurance  
premium by about 50%^251. The premium rates paid by livestock owners in India ranges from  
2.25% to 5%. The premiums are lower for dairy cooperatives and dairies. Additional premium  
are to be paid for disability cover and transit cover. In states like Kerala, it is also bundled with  
non-financial instruments such as subsidized cattle feed.

Some of the reasons attributed for low penetration of livestock insurance product in India are as  
under^252

*   The most prevalent model of insurance is credit linked subsidized insurance, which while  
    helps in increased uptake, limits further product development and leads to potential  
    malpractices or fraud.
*   The low set premium leads to under-priced policies requiring several riders. This results  
    in the risk being effectively transferred to insurees as the risk mitigation facilities such as  
    vaccination, deworming, etc. are not widespread.
*   Malpractices occurring with livestock have put insurance companies at financial risks.  
    Companies engaged in providing livestock insurance have reported a high loss ratio  
    ranging between 40-80%^253. For example, in unorganised markets the agents often  
    employ malpractices such as scrubbing teeth and horns to hide the age of the animal,  
    tampering with ear tags, claims lodged on non-working days to avoid verification by  
    veterinarians within 24 hours, etc.
*   Limited market for insurance products due to perceived high premium cost and short  
    cycle of animal rearing.
*   Tedious claim settlement process resulting in farmers and stakeholders not opting for  
    insurance due to their past experience.
*   One of the mandatory requirements of credit linked insurance is ear-tagging of animal  
    and health certification which is found to be tedious and cumbersome by the farmers. The  
    process of valuation of animal is also not well understood by the farmers as the valuation

    is dependent on age as well as potential productivity of the animal which in unorganized
    markets are subjective and based on experience.
    

*   Insurance companies are reluctant to extend insurance in regions with high climatic  
    vulnerability and diseases, as they increase the associated risks of cattle owners and  
    insurance companies alike.
*   The process of claim settlement for disability cover or instances of diseases is also  
    complicated and often leads to rejection of claims.

In addition to the above constraints, it was also observed that the beneficiaries who have opted  
for livestock insurance once typically do not go for renewal - a micro-level study of livestock  
insurance in Haryana and Rajasthan revealed that only 9% of the surveyed HHs have renewed  
their livestock insurance policy. The reasons reported for non-renewal are mentioned below.

*   Claim settlement is complicated (Haryana (92.4%), Rajasthan (95.2%))
*   Very high premium (Haryana (82.2%), Rajasthan (65.9%))
*   Not useful (Haryana (61.5%), Rajasthan (69.1%))
*   Lack of trust on insurance providers (Haryana (50.4%), Rajasthan (53.8%))
*   Rejection of claims (Haryana (46.5%), Rajasthan (55.1%))
*   Lack of information about renewal process (Haryana (93.9%), Rajasthan (95.1%))

An analysis of policy documents of few major cattle insurance provider companies in India reveal  
that the detailed policy documents have many exclusions, for instance, no product is available  
that can take care of disease outbreak/ epidemics of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), Hemorrhagic  
Septicemia (HS), Anthrax, etc., theft, wilful injury or neglect, unskilful treatment, partial disability,  
transportion of animals beyond 50 Km from place of purchase, etc. which lead the policies open  
to interpretations which is a deterrent for a population which is largely non-conversant with the  
legal language of the policy documents.

The suggestive measures to reduce risks for livestock owners are provided below:

*   Need to sensitize that livestock insurance is seen as one of the measures and not the only  
    measure. Livestock insurance needs to be complemented with other measures such as  
    disease control, better nutrition and breed improvement.
*   Need to understand the requirement of both the farmers and the insurance products for  
    inputs into designing the policy, schemes and insurance product accordingly^254
*   A pre-requisite for development of market based insurance product is the existence of a  
    well-functioning disease prevention and control programme^255 ; therefore, a better  
    veterinary infrastructure, access to vaccination and deworming for animals need to be  
    ensured. Initiatives such as LHDC and NADCP needs to be strengthened in this regard.

*   Creation of database on livestock, variety and productivity and associated risk for  
    estimating accurate premium and risk profiling.
*   Expansion of product risk cover which encapsulate disease cover to include diseases like  
    FMD, zoonotic diseases, etc.
*   Adequate mechanism for indemnity payment to cattle owners for reporting disease  
    outbreak in time should be encouraged^256.
*   Tamper-proof systems with use of technologies such as RFID/ chip – IoT based sub-  
    dermal implants, nano-stamping, facial/ muzzle recognition, etc. needs to be leveraged  
    for fraud control.
*   Community based insurance model such as the Loan Protection Scheme by Vizianagaram  
    District Poverty Initiatives Project (DPIP) in Andhra Pradesh, India needs to be  
    encouraged.

Box 99 : Community Based Insurance Model

*   Along with the issue of livestock insurance, lack of credit in the livestock sector is also one  
    of the major challenges faced by livestock farmers. While Priority Sector Lending includes  
    proprietorship firms of farmers directly engaged in Agriculture and Allied Activities, viz.,  
    dairy, fishery, animal husbandry, poultry, bee-keeping and sericulture, the targets have  
    been defined overall and the focus largely remains on agriculture. Therefore, separate  
    targets for livestock sector under Priority Sector Lending needs to be included. The

    highlights that the Livestock sector receives about 12% of total public expenditure of  
    agriculture and allied sector and 4-5% of total institutional credit. The report  
    recommends encouraging share of institutional credit to livestock sector to at least 10%.  
    Also, to boost easy credit at subsidised rates, in February 2019, the Government of India  
    has extended the facility of Kisan Credit Cards to farmers engaged in Animal Husbandry  
    and Fisheries activities.

    Community Based Insurance Model
    The project was initiated as loan protection scheme in 2003 as a social risk management system.
    The Vizainagaram district programme management unit and Zila Samakhya (ZS) conceptualised
    this program to encourage community involvement and address issue of false claims. A
    transparent process of insurance for submission of claims was developed for SHG members. One
    Bima Mitra was responsible for each mandal of the district. Bima Mitra played a central role
    from insurance application to verification and settlement process of claim. Once the ZS started
    booking profits the premium was reduced from 4% to 2% in 2009-10. The higher transparency
    and accessibility of Bima mitra and involvement of village organisation helped in increasing
    greater participation as community as a whole became a major stakeholder. The increased
    willingness of SHG members to pay for insurance helped in increasing insurance coverage to
    more than 80% of SHG members with loss ratio of less than 40% which is rarely observed in
    partner-agent model in the country.

*   Moreover, a comprehensive tripartite (Banks/ FIs, Processors and Insurance Service  
    Providers) credit and risk mitigation system may lead to easier credit access and financial  
    risk coverage for the farmers as depicted in the figure below.  
    Infographic showing comprehensive tripartite credit and risk mitigation system for dairy farmers
*   As highlighted above, the higher utilization/ deployment of tamper-proof technology  
    systems to minimize malpractices in insurance claims would lead to increased uptake of  
    livestock insurance which can act as credit security to banks for unforeseen risks.  
    Furthermore, dairy farmers/ groups of dairy farmers can be linked to milk processors,  
    wherein, the processors would affirm the credit worthiness of dairy farmers to insurance  
    service providers. Also, a part of the payment to be made to dairy farmers by the  
    processors can be provided to banks for additional credit security, while not affecting the  
    regular operations of producers. This will also help the milk processors in scaling up their  
    business with assured availability of milk and continued loyalty of farmers. Therefore,  
    leading to easier access to credit for dairy farmers.

**Marketing**

*   A2 milk is perceived to be having better health benefits 257 than the A1 milk primarily  
    derived from high yielding breed such as Holstein Friesian and some crossbreds. The  
    Indian indigenous breeds and buffaloes mostly produce A2 milk and it fetches a higher  
    price when marketed as A2 milk. Concerted efforts should be made to promote A2 milk  
    as superior health product. A2 milk products can become a unique selling proposition for  
    selling in export markets.
*   Similarly, organic milk and milk products should also be promoted across the country as  
    there is lack of focus on promotion of such products in the country.
*   GI indicators/ breed based marketing can be promoted for higher value creation (e.g.  
    Camel milk from Rajasthan, Sahiwal milk from Punjab/ Haryana, etc.).

(^257) Although certain studies do not support the same

    be explored.
*   Facilitation for creation and Revitalization of livestock markets under the Agricultural  
    Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitating) Act (APLM), 2017.
*   Promotion of Collateral Management Players in the sector along the lines of those in the  
    agricultural commodity sector, especially for products with longer duration shelf life like  
    butter, ghee, milk powder, etc.
*   To develop access to neighbouring countries for liquid milk there is a need to explore  
    appropriate low-cost innovations for quick transport (for example, development of barge  
    mounted milk tankers as was done to develop rail milk tankers, to tap Sri Lankan liquid  
    milk market from east coast) to these markets.
*   Ensure traceability using techniques such as block chain/ unique ID/ QR code, which will  
    lead to much better utilisation of e-Pashuhaat.
*   The key foreign markets should be identified for exports which have potential for growth  
    and should be engaged through targeted promotional campaigns.

**Healthcare and Extension Activities**

As mentioned earlier, the animal healthcare system in the country has several challenges  
including inefficiencies in provision of curative health services and limited attention towards  
preventive health system. In the case of curative health services, a large gap also exists between  
the need and the availability of animal health service providers for cows and buffaloes. This has  
led to farmers opting for local alternatives such as untrained personnel or self-medication. Key  
recommendations for improving the animal healthcare system in the country are provided below.

*   All the animals should be uniquely identified to ensure traceability. The surveillance  
    system such as INAPH should be utilized to track the health of animals. System to be  
    developed for annual diagnosis of all animals as regards the diseases such as TB, FMD,  
    Brucellosis etc. apart from general animal health.
*   This should be supported with animal quarantine facilities at village level across the  
    country to avoid mixing of diseased animals from healthy animals.
*   CHRS should be universally expanded and linked to INAPH for continuous disease  
    surveillance system. Early warning systems need to be developed for early identification  
    and containment of diseases from turning into epidemic.
*   There should be emphasis on capacity building on improved animal management  
    practices, breed improvement, fodder development, milk processing facilities, etc.  
    contributing to the natural and physical livelihood assets. There is a need for faster  
    multiplication of superior germplasm by adopting multiple ovulation, embryo transfer  
    and sexed semen techniques is emphasized. Efforts should be made to develop skilled  
    personnel in this area of specialization.
*   Along with raising productivity of milch animals, it is important to improve quality, both  
    in terms of input as well as output. There is an immediate need to educate the farmers  
    about adoption of safe milk production practices, to receive higher milk prices based on  
    the microbial quality apart from the chemical composition. Therefore, agricultural

    190
    

    practices, sanitation, quality of drinking water & fodder, type and quality of pipelines - all
    of these need to be aligned to the goal of healthy milk.
    

*   Skill building should be initiated by combining vocational and entrepreneurship training  
    programmes to facilitate the support to  
    small animal husbandry and dairy  
    enterprises by matching supply to current  
    demand of workers with skill and  
    competencies. The industry should  
    partake in short-term trainings as well as  
    Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)  
    programmes under National Schemes like  
    PMKVY, DDUGKY, etc.
*   As highlighted earlier that the current number of veterinary institutions in India have a  
    capacity to cater to only 330.84 million livestock, against the population of 535.82 million.  
    The shortfall/ gaps can be addressed by training of para-vets who can assist a veterinary  
    physician in the performance of their duties or carry out animal management and  
    preliminary healthcare procedures (e.g. AI, vaccination, delivery, etc.) as part of  
    veterinary care system.
*   The para-vets can be further connected through mobile based application/ IoT enabled  
    platform on the lines of telemedicine with the veterinarians at district/ state/ central level  
    to provide appropriate and quick animal healthcare services at the village/ hamlet levels.

**Research and Development**

*   R&D to promote sexed semen of indigenous breeds. The investment for the same may not  
    necessarily come from public sector budget. Existing international and Indian companies  
    in the sexed semen business may be guaranteed a minimal offtake by the State  
    Governments/ Cooperatives/ Private sector to ensure viability. This will address the  
    problem of male calves, at the same time ensuring genetic purity of indigenous breeds,  
    while improving productivity.
*   Development and promotion of standalone, low maintenance, mutli-purpose micro cold-  
    chains running on renewable energy sources (like solar PVCs, biomass) for ensuring the  
    quality of milk immediately after milking. There are many start-ups which are working  
    on mini cold-chains, however, there is need for customization of such systems for milk  
    and milk products.
*   There is a need to promote R&D on development of environment friendly packaging  
    material for packaging of milk and milk products and other livestock products.
*   As mentioned earlier, in the dairy sector in  
    India, around 40% of marketable surplus of the  
    milk is processed either in cooperative or  
    private sector. Compared to the processing level  
    of milk in developed country which is pegged at  
    around 90%, there is huge scope to increase the  
    processing of milk through organized sector and  
    also utilize the surplus for various milk products. Moreover, most of the milk products

    RPL is a platform to provide recognition to
    the informal learning or learning through
    work to get equal acceptance as the formal
    levels of education. The programme aims
    to impart skills training for existing workers
    to align the competencies of the regulated
    workforce
    

    Austrian producer of plastic packaging
    solutions Alpla and Sweden’s paper

    manufactured in India by the organized sector through mechanized process majorly
    include milk powder, butter, ghee, curd and cheese. However, there is a large market for
    traditional milk based products which is catered mainly by the unorganized sector (about
    80 - 82% which is estimated to be about Rs. 1 lakh Crores).^258 Considering this, adequate
    attention should be given on research and development for technology induction to
    manufacture traditional value added products maintaining the intrinsic quality along
    with longer shelf life. This research should be supplemented by mechanizing the
    production to ensure GMP and incorporate HACCP.
    

*   Research and Development on Manure Management to reduce the carbon foot prints of  
    manure as also utilize it as fuel and manure.
*   Promote product development and product incubation centres to encourage  
    entrepreneurs to develop and test market new products and packaging solutions.
*   Some of the important areas where focus needs to be provided for R&D are listed below.  
    o Ethno-veterinary medicines  
    o Broiller buffalo/ goat/ sheep similar to poultry (which is only reared for meat)  
    o Dry dairy to address stray cattle (cow dung, urine for medicinal purpose, and organic  
    manure)  
    o Thermo stable FMD vaccines with longer immunity  
    o Recovery of IVF embryos  
    o Research on heat tolerance capabilities and disease-resistance capabilities of Indian  
    breeds  
    o Region specific animal nutrition strategy for cows and buffalos

Box 20 : The Role of Private-Sector R&D in Agricultural and Allied Activities Innovation

**Policy Level Interventions**

*   Over the years, the contribution of the sector to the agricultural GVA has increased  
    manifolds from 21.6% in 2011-12 to 27.4% in 2017-18. The sector also constitutes 11%  
    of the agricultural exports. This clearly indicates the increasing contribution of livestock  
    sector in the economy. However, the sector has not received adequate attention from the  
    policy makers which is reflected in the budget for animal husbandry and dairying related

    Research and Development: The Role of Private-Sector R&D in Agricultural and Allied
    Activities Innovation
    The efforts to improve agricultural R&D require the public and private sector to address several
    critical challenges. R&D cycles need to be accelerated to further the widespread adoption of
    promising innovations - particularly in low-income countries such as India - as a precursor to
    improving outputs. The lag between successful R&D efforts and the widespread adoption of
    agricultural innovations have tended to be long; at least 15 to 25 years before peak impacts. In
    the USA for hybrid corn, the total adoption cycle from early research to commercial adoption
    took over 40 years—or arguably longer.
    Another challenge is that many of the most promising agricultural innovations are capital-
    intensive, and agriculture has historically been dominated by small businesses with low
    profitability and limited access to capital. In developed countries, some of the promising
    initiatives to overcome these challenges are:
    (1) Consolidation in agriculture to boost efficiency
    (2) More widespread use of crop insurance providing farmers with more financial security
    (3) Improving access to credit.
    At present, in higher-income countries, 1.99% of agricultural GDP is spent on agricultural
    insurance, but that falls to 0.29% in upper-middle-income countries, 0.16% in lower-middle
    income countries, and 0.01% in low-income countries.
    The government can foster an attractive environment for venture capital funds and corporate
    ventures focusing on agricultural innovation, and help ensure that the investments being made
    by the private sector can make a greater impact, by taking the following steps:
    (1) Support agricultural extension efforts to disseminate knowledge about new technologies
    and techniques and to demonstrate their business case. Publicly funded agricultural extension
    has been a key historical link between agricultural R&D and farmers in high-income countries.
    Government and multi-national organizations should prioritize implementing such
    programmes.
    (2) Streamline regulation to reduce lag times, provide targeted tax relief to enhance farmers’
    incomes and financial security, and offer preferential access to land and market support for
    promising agricultural techniques and technologies as a result of the R&D efforts.
    (3) Create public-private partnerships, which government can use to leverage public-sector
    investment, enhance private sector involvement in agriculture infrastructure, and fill gaps in the
    delivery and adoption of innovation by public- and private-sector entities acting independently.

    schemes constituting only 2.1% of the agricultural budget. Considering the increasing
    dependence of rural population and its overall contribution in GVA, the budget for animal
    husbandry and dairying may be rationalised more in line with its contribution.
    

*   It has been observed that many times that the schemes are unable to perform as per the  
    expectations due to lack of or delayed contribution of funds by the State Governments.  
    This is mostly due to fiscal situation of the State Governments and their own development  
    priorities. Considering this it is recommended that some of the major schemes which are  
    critical for the growth of the sector  
    may be funded as Central Sector  
    Schemes.
*   There is a need to shift the  
    focus from “domestic market  
    and consumption” to “export  
    oriented production”. India is  
    already a milk sufficient  
    country, however, India’s  
    share in the global exports is  
    low.  
    One of the reasons for  
    unacceptability of the Indian  
    milk products including SMP in  
    the international markets  
    stems from quality issues. This  
    can be addressed by clean milk  
    production, traceability, micro  
    level cold chains and quality-  
    based efficient production systems, with export market as a target to increase India’s  
    share in the global milk products trade.
*   The focus needs to be on promotion of entrepreneurship led sustainable models in the  
    sector.
*   OIE-World Organisation for Animal Health, within the framework of close collaboration  
    and the development of joint strategies with FAO and WHO to prevent health risks at the  
    human–animal–ecosystems interface, have set three priority areas which are animal  
    influenza, antimicrobial resistance and rabies^259. It is recommend that control of these  
    diseases should be made a national priority as well with 100% central assistance.
*   Information Network for Animal Productivity and Health (INAPH) should be the common  
    system to be adopted by all the stakeholders to create data, carry out analysis and  
    generate reports so that compiled data and required analysis would be available at  
    national level which would further facilitate planning process with high accuracy in  
    future. Presently, this network is not integrated across the different stakeholders of the  
    sector and is being used in an isolated way by certain schemes. This leads to information

**Milk: Production Excess of Consumption in the  
Future**  
Exports of SMP from India is low as compared to  
exports from countries such as USA and NZ although,  
the overall milk production is much higher in India. The  
Indian SMP is considered to be of inferior quality which  
results primarily from the lower quality of milk  
produced and collected.  
In the year 2018, a significant glut was observed in  
milk production in India leading to steeply falling prices  
of milk. To reduce the inventory of SMP in the country,  
Government of India approved a subsidy of 10% on  
export price while certain state governments such as  
Gujarat and Maharashtra offered Rs 50,000 per MT of  
SMP as additional subsidy for exports.

    asymmetry. There is a need for further development of a comprehensive livestock
    database to capture real-time information on animal and various aspects of animal
    management practices to inform policy development. INAPH can be upgraded to capture
    this aspect also.
    

*   The total value of output from livestock sector comprises of about 66% from milk group  
    of products and less than 25% from eggs, meat and meat products. This sub-sector also  
    needs to be given equal emphasis as the dairy sector, given that it contributes significantly  
    to nutritional security, especially overcoming protein deficiency and continued significant  
    contribution to exports. Most of the schemes in the sector are geared towards dairy with  
    either a small component for other sub-sectors, except for NLM, where the focus is on  
    small ruminants, piggery and poultry.
*   Bringing White Revolution to Eastern and North-Eastern India: Operation Flood and  
    White Revolution have spurred growth in milk production and dairying in India. Focus on  
    dairy cooperative structure and infrastructure development has also helped in increasing  
    per capita production and better productivity. However, as the sectoral statistics show,  
    eastern states like Bihar, Odisha, Chhattisgarh still lag far behind to their western,  
    northern and southern counterparts. It is observed that while states like Bihar have a very  
    high number of dairy cooperative societies, it has limited infrastructure and procurement.  
    Eastern and North Eastern States like Assam (71 gm/day), Orissa (132 gm/day), West  
    Bengal (153 gm/day), and Bihar (239 gm/day) have low per capita availability of milk^260  
    and there is wide gap in infrastructure for procurement, processing and marketing of  
    milk. **Considering this, a separate strategy needs to be developed for boosting milk**  
    **production in eastern and north eastern states.** The dairy cooperatives in these states  
    have to be supported financially and technically. Additionally private dairies can also be  
    promoted.  
    o It is observed that the milk procurement for entire eastern region is only 2871  
    (TLPD) most of which is concentrated in Bihar. This is lower than the total  
    procurement in States of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.  
    Therefore, adequate focus must be given on milk procurement through  
    cooperatives to strengthen.  
    o The state cooperatives can be handheld by central government or NDDB. A  
    specialised technical team can be established at state level to assess the situation  
    and develop strategy.  
    o Studies can be financed to assess gaps, bottlenecks and opportunities in these  
    states  
    o Awareness generation on livestock health and productivity improvement should  
    be promoted to boost production in these States  
    o Separate breed improvement institute can be established for production of HGM  
    bulls and increase coverage of AI in these states.  
    o Region specific animal nutrition strategy have to be developed for better animal  
    health, this will help in breed improvement and increasing production.

    o Tie-ups can be developed with the agricultural department for diversification and
    promotion of integrated farming and livestock management practices.
    o More animals should be bought under INAPH portal and their health and nutrition
    have to be monitored
    o New schemes such as NADCP needs to be promoted to control diseases like FMD,
    brucellosis. In addition, a focus needs to be provided for controlling bovine
    mastisis in these states.
    

    Key Recommendations at the Sector Level for Achieving Transformational Improvements
    Across the Value Chain
    

*   Availability of feed and fodder, both in terms of quantity and quality is a major constraint. The  
    area under fodder crops has stagnated at about 8.5 to 9 million hectares. Expected shortfall in  
    demand for dry, green and concentrates is 11%, 35% and 45% respectively. The pasture lands  
    in India are overgrazed and not properly managed which leads to lower productivity. In many  
    states the grazing pressure is very high compared to carrying capacity with 70% of grazing land  
    identified in poor and very poor condition. Increasing cost of feed and fodder has been identified  
    as the major constraint in dairy sector. Despite these constraints, very limited focus is there  
    within the Animal Husbandry scheme on fodder development. Under NLM, it accounts for less  
    than 15% of total funds spent. Considering the challenge, increasing feed and fodder availability  
    for animals will help in reducing input costs. Focus should be on better management of grazing  
    land and quality fodder production by bringing more area under green fodder cultivation.  
    Diversified cultivation of crops including millets, legumes is not only beneficial for soil health but  
    is essential for economical milk production as well.
*   There are government animal farms which are not being utilized in an efficient and effective  
    manner. It is suggested that these farms may be leased out to the youth/ FPOs in the area in a  
    transparent manner to promote entrepreneurship development in the community.
*   A comprehensive tripartite (Banks/ FIs, Processors and Insurance Service Providers) credit and  
    risk mitigation system may lead to easier credit access and financial risk coverage for the farmers,  
    a presented in Box #15.
*   Business incubators should be promoted to handhold the grass-root organizations/ farmer  
    collectives into viable businesses and scaling up of operations through effective go-to-market  
    strategies and adoption of integrated farming model. For instance, Villgro, Intellicap, Encore,  
    Center for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship (CUE IIMA), Start-up Oasis, SIDBI  
    Innovation and Incubation Centre (SIIC) are some of the business incubators, which are presently  
    incubating social enterprises including agri/ dairy enterprises across the country.
*   Efforts need to be devoted towards rollout of countrywide vaccination campaigns for preventable  
    communicable diseases prevention in cattle. Campaigns on the lines of “Pulse Polio”  
    (immunization campaign established by the Government of India to eliminate poliomyelitis  
    (polio) in India) may be undertaken for improving production and productivity along with better  
    quality of milk. Diseases like FMD, Brucellosis can be eradicated from the country by adopting an  
    intensive vaccination programme. This initiative can be taken at a state level by prioritization of  
    geographies for eradication of diseases.
*   Hydroponics generally involves high investment, many times rendering it unviable for fodder  
    cultivation. Although there are certain low-cost hydroponic options, however, more R&D is

    196
    

    required for cost reduction of hydroponic technology for fodder production along with increased
    efficiency.
    

*   More private sector players need to attracted in breed improvement, diversification of products,  
    processing and value addition of livestock products by providing subsidy and interest subvention  
    in the initial period. Similar models/ schemes under implementation by a few of other central  
    government ministries such as Setting up of Electronic Manufacturing Clusters by Ministry of  
    Electronics and Information Technology, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks by Ministry of  
    Textiles, etc. aim at mobilizing investment from private players for development of respective  
    sectors.
*   As highlighted above, a separate strategy needs to be developed for boosting milk production in  
    eastern and north eastern states.
*   Technical support groups involving multi-disciplinary team needs to be created for project  
    management, planning and implementation at the central and state level. Fixed term contracts/  
    tenures for scheme level officials for 3-4 years with yearly performance linked appraisal may be  
    introduced for higher accountability.

Part:C – Fisheries Sector

Chapter 1: Sector Level Analysis: Fisheries

### 1.2 Performance of the Sector

Historically, fishing comprised artisanal inshore capture fishery using traditional sailboats and  
cataramans. The Indian Fisheries Act of 1897 was a milestone act in India’s history, which  
delegated to the erstwhile Provinces (States) the responsibility of development and conservation  
of fisheries in the inland and territorial waters of the respective States. It also empowered the  
States to formulate their own rules and regulations for the protection and safeguard of their  
fisheries. Further, the Act provided adoption of conservation measures to prevent the destruction  
of resources. Consequently, the development, management and conservation of fish and fisheries  
became a State subject. India has come a long way since then. Fish production has increased from  
0.75 Million Metric tonnes (MMT) in 1950-51 to 13.7 MMT during 2018- 19261.

Fisheries and aquaculture sector provides employment to 14.5 million people, and contributes  
close to 1% to national GDP. India accounts for over 5% of global fish production, and is the  
second largest fish producer in the world (after China), with a total production of 13.7 million  
metric tons (MMT) in 2018-19. Despite this, India suffers from low remuneration for fisherfolk  
(as fish products are highly perishable and most small and marginal farmers cannot afford to  
invest in decent infrastructure to preserve quality), low yields compared to global standards, low  
technology penetration, limited infrastructure, and over exploitation of inland fisheries.

The government through its schemes intends to increase production and productivity of fisheries  
in a responsible and sustainable manner. To achieve this, it has strengthened focus on  
modernizing technology through use of motorized craft, onboard pre-processing facilities,  
satellite-based remote sensing techniques, and establishment of hatcheries, among other things.  
The government is also committed to ensure infrastructure development in the sector,  
particularly post-harvest infrastructure to ensure decent remuneration to fisherfolk. Lastly, an  
enhancement in fish production would not only increase food and nutritional security (as fish  
products are high in protein and Omega-3), but would also increase farmer income if the products  
can be exported internationally after value-addition. A representative illustrative of the sector’s  
vision is given below:

_Fisheries Sector Assessment_

Fisheries and aquaculture is considered the sunrise sector in the Indian economy, providing  
employment to 14.5 million people, and contributing close to 1% to national GDP and 5.2% of  
agricultural GDP^262. India accounts for over 5% of global fish production^263 , and is the second  
largest fish producer in the world (after China), with a total production of 13.7 million metric tons  
(MMT) in 2018- 19264. More than 50 different types of fish and shellfish products are being  
exported to 75 countries around the world. Fish and fish products have emerged as the largest  
group in agricultural exports from India.

India has been able to exploit and utilize only around 57 percent of potential in the Fresh Water  
Aquaculture and around 70 percent in Marine Fisheries. The fish production has increased to  
12.61 MMT in 2017-18 with a contribution of 8.92 MMT from inland sector and 3.69 MMT from  
marine sector. The marine resources of the country comprise an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)  
of 2.02 million sq. kms, a Continental Shelf Area of 5,30,000 sq. km and a Coastline of 8,118 kms^265.  
The Marine Fishery Potential in the Indian waters have been estimated at 5.31 MMT constituting  
about 43.3% demersal, 49.5% pelagic and 4.3% oceanic groups.

As it can be seen from above, India’s fisheries sector contribution to the total agriculture economy  
is similar to that of China and Malaysia, while other South East Asian countries like Philippines  
and Indonesia have a higher contribution from fisheries to its agriculture and allied sector.

_Key commodities of the sector_

**Fisheries**

There are two main types of fishing: Inland fishing, and Marine fishing. Inland fishing refers to  
fishing in freshwater (lakes and rivers) while marine fishing refers to fishing in saltwater  
(oceans). Traditionally, the output of marine fisheries was higher than that of inland fisheries^266.  
However, since 1991, India’s Inland Fish production has increased gradually. In 2000-01, inland  
fisheries overtook marine fisheries in terms of production and the trend has endured since then.

Figure 13 : Fisheries sector structure

Another way of categorizing fish cultivation is Capture and Culture fisheries.

**Capture fisheries** refer to exploitation of aquatic organisms without stocking the seed.  
Recruitment of the species occur naturally. This is carried out in the sea, rivers, reservoirs, etc.  
Fish yield decreases gradually in capture fisheries due to indiscriminate catching of fish including  
brooders and juveniles.

**Culture fisheries** refer to cultivation of selected fishes in confined areas with utmost care to get  
maximum yield. The seed is stocked, nursed and reared in confined waters, then the crop is  
harvested. Culture takes place in ponds, which are fertilized and supplementary feeds are  
provided to fish to get maximum yield. Due to the culture of a variety of aquatic organisms  
(prawns, crabs, molluscs, frogs, sea weeds, etc.), culture fisheries has been termed as  
**aquaculture**.

From a production level of 0.75 million tonnes in 1950-51, total fish production reached 13.4  
million tonnes in 2018-19e^267. **Despite this tremendous increase, India still produces only a  
tenth of world’s number one fish producer, China.**

The marine fisheries sector contributes 30% to total production, against 70% by the inland sector  
as of 2018-19. While inland sector is a major contributor in India, globally marine sector  
contributes the major share of 66% indicating the preponderance of the inland sector in India.^268  
The inland sector has grown at a faster rate due to growth of aquaculture and because Indians  
tend to prefer low cost-high protein fish.

The fisheries and aquaculture sector has the potential to contribute to many of the Sustainable  
Development Goals covering poverty, hunger and food security, protection, restoration and  
management of inland water resources and ecosystems and biodiversity.^269 Hence, fisheries has  
been recognised as important component of integrated farming system being advocated as one  
of the strategies for doubling of farmers’ income^270.

**Aquaculture feed**

The India Aquaculture Feed Market was valued at USD 1.20 billion (Rs. 7790 crore) in 2017 and  
is expected to register a CAGR of 10.4% during 2018- 2023271. The Aquaculture Feed Market  
consists of fish feed, molluscs feed, crustaceous feed. There are further sub-segments of carp feed,  
salmon feed, tilapia feed, catfish feed and others in fish feed. Major feed ingredients include de-  
oiled rice bran, wheat bran, cotton seed cake, and groundnut cake. In order to maintain quality of  
fish feed, quality control at fish feed mills and manufacturing units are maintained.

_Key drivers for growth_

*   **Low current per capita consumption:** The average per capita consumption of fish in  
    India stands at 6.6kg/year while it stands at 20kg/year globally (UN FAO). This leaves  
    immense scope for increase in domestic consumption, which can drive the market. The  
    growing restaurant culture, greater product availability, and rising awareness on health  
    benefits are expected to further support this trend.
*   **Growth of aquaculture** : In 1980s, aquaculture contributed less than a fifth to India’s fish  
    production; by 2030, it is expected to be responsible for two-thirds of fish production.  
    This increase will lead to higher overall production of fish, as well as higher demand for  
    better quality feed. With the decline in demand for capture fish owing to overfishing and  
    pollution issues, aquaculture has gained pace.
*   **Improvement in infrastructure** : Currently, the fish industry utilizes only 1% of total  
    cold chain infrastructure in the country^272. Acknowledging this, The Marine Products

    203
    

    Export Development Authority (MPEDA) has identified development of cold chain
    infrastructure as a thrust area. It is now focusing on: monitoring of seafood quality in
    landing and pre-processing centers; setting up mini labs and pre-processing centers for
    preserving quality; evolving compliance standards, and upgrading existing fishing
    harbours.
    

*   **Improved technology:** A switch towards more technology-driven and efficient intensive  
    farming technologies has enabled fish farmers to increase production in the last few years.  
    Yet, there is immense scope for modernization at ports and harbours, and hygienic  
    handling facilities.
*   **Favorable government policies:** The government has merged all schemes of fisheries  
    sector into an umbrella scheme of “Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and  
    Management of Fisheries”. This is expected to sharpen focus on fish production and  
    productivity from aquaculture and fisheries resources. A Fisheries and Aquaculture  
    Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) has also been approved with a corpus of Rs.  
    7,522.48 crore. A National Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy (NIFAP) is also on the  
    anvil.
*   **Integration with Sagarmala programme:** Union ministry of shipping is expending Rs  
    4,142 crore on development of 28 fishing harbours across India under the Sagarmala  
    Programme. The development of these harbours and consequent development of coastal  
    regions will generate new employment opportunities and boost fish production in the  
    country.
*   **Large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ):** India has one of the largest EEZ of 2.02 million  
    sq. km (compared to China’s 0.88 million sq. km), implying that India has exclusive  
    jurisdiction over the resources present in this zone including navigation of seafaring  
    trade. The fish resources in the EEZs are still underexploited due to limited resources with  
    the fishers for buying deep-sea vessels.

### 1.1 Background of the Sector

_Production and productivity_

India is the second largest fish-producing nation in the world. Combining the production of all  
types of fisheries (capture and culture), the total fish production in the country has reached at  
about 13.4 MMT in 2018-19e^274. Over 70% of this production is from inland fisheries. India  
currently exports over 10% of its production.

In India, a unique trend persists wherein the share of freshwater fishes is higher than that of  
marine fishes. This reflects the taste preferences of Indian consumers who prefer low cost-high  
protein alternatives.

Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal are the two largest states in India in terms of total fish  
production. These two states are also the largest producers of freshwater fish in the country.  
Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh lead in saltwater fish production.

The comparison of India’s fish production with nations having considerable fish production  
reveals that India’s share of marine fish production is lower than all other countries except  
Myanmar. This shows there is scope of improving marine fish production in India as well, given  
India’s lengthy coastline.

_Processing & Storage Infrastructure_

In India, many people still suffer from under-nourishment and poverty, therefore, it is imperative  
to minimize post-harvest losses. For fish and other seafood, the situation is even more crucial as  
the reduction in quality is quick. Fish for consumption in domestic market is not processed and  
is stored in ice flakes for transportation. Domestically, the vendors procure unprocessed fish from  
commission agents after primary sorting and grading to sell to consumers in local markets as  
soon as possible (due to high perishability). For export, the products are generally moved to flake  
ice/ block ice (farm to factory) to block processing/ blast freezing/ IQF (processing and freezing),  
to freezer cold storages (storage), and finally to cold chain containers (logistics and export).

_Post-harvest losses_

Significant post-harvest losses occur due to lack of availability of storage infrastructure at many  
places. The losses tend to multiply in small-scale fisheries due to inadequate infrastructure.  
Facilities/ techniques such as ice flakes, smoking, solar drying may be used to reduce these losses.  
Some physical losses are caused by insects, which consume large quantities of fish flesh. CIPHET  
has conducted periodic studies to estimate post-harvest losses across the value chain in  
agriculture and allied sector. Two such studies have been conducted, the first study was published  
in 2012 and the second was published in 2015.

Table 50 Post-harvest losses for Fisheries reported in CIPHET studies

    2012 2015
    Inland Fish 6.92% 5.23%
    Marine Fish 2.78%
    (excluding losses in harvesting
    operations)
    

    10.52%
    (including losses in harvesting
    operations)
    

As can be seen from the table above that the overall total losses reported in fisheries operations  
varies for Inland and Marine Fish. The reported losses reduced for inland fisheries from 6.92% to  
5.23% and increased for marine fish. However, the difference in marine fish case is primarily due  
to the losses reported in harvesting operations (7.4%), which were not accounted for in the  
previous study. The status of post-harvest losses in fisheries for 2015 is presented below.

It is important to note that significant variation has been reported across regions within India.  
Lowest losses for inland fisheries were reported in West Bengal (1.62%) while highest were  
reported for Bihar (8.88%). Similarly higher losses were reported for marine fishes in southern  
plateau (11.41%) in comparison to east coast (3.83%). It may be noted that there are also  
instances where post-harvest losses of up to 20-25% have been reported across the value  
chain^275.

_Price Realization_

The per unit price realization has been gradually increasing in the inland sector, owing to rise in  
diversity and value added products coming from aquaculture.

As it can be seen from the graph, there has been a 39.1% increase in price of fish between 2015-  
16 and 2018-19.

_Exports_

While the world agricultural trade has been relatively stagnant during 2013-17 (majorly) due to  
fall in global prices, India’s export of coffee, cereals, horticultural produce doubled; while exports  
of meat, fish, processed products grew between three to five times.

The Agriculture Export Policy 2018 was approved by Government of India in December 2018  
which aims to increase India’s agricultural exports to USD 60 billion by 2022 and USD 100 billion  
in the next few years with a stable trade policy regime. Many state governments have also  
introduced export policies, with special focus on agri exports, including fisheries. The trend of  
exports for the sector have been provided below.

The exports for the fisheries sector as a percentage of production has been increasing steadily  
since 2015-16 and is estimated to continue on the same trend in the future. Among various items  
being exported shrimp is the major contributor, having a share of 68% of the total value of the  
export as of 2018-19.

Fresh shrimp is the largest exported commodity in terms of volume (accounting for 30-40% of  
exports) as well as value (fetching over 68% of total fish exports). This is followed by fresh fin

China is the largest fish producer and since 2002 has also been the largest exporter of fish and  
fish products, although they represent only 1% of China’s total merchandise trade. Since 2011  
China has also been the world’s third largest importer of fish and fish products, partly because  
large quantities of fish are imported for processing and then re-exported, but also because rising  
incomes and changes in consumption habits create markets for species not produced locally.  
Despite being the second largest producer, India stands 4th in terms of export of fish products in

2018.  This is because of India’s lagging storage and processing infrastructure, which causes huge  
    post-harvest losses. Also, India is yet to match up to global quality standards required for exports.  
    A comparison of top fish exporting countries and change in their contribution to global exports  
    from 2006 to 2016 has been provided in the table below.

At the global level, the total export of fishery products (including fish and crustaceans, molluscs  
and other aquatic invertebrates^276 ) from India has a share of 5.1% as of 2018 and is currently  
pegged at ~USD 6,349 million^277. In the global trade of fishery products, India ranks 4th. The top  
10 exporters of fishery products along with their respective share in the world fishery exports as  
of 2018 is shown in the following figure.

**Discussion on Cross Sectional Thematic Areas**

    i. Accountability and Transparency
    

The Department of Fisheries which is a constituent department under the Department of  
Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is the apex institution providing  
assistance to all State Governments in terms of progress of marine and inland fish production,  
upgradation of genetic resources, increasing availability of nutritious feed, processing and  
profitability of fisheries enterprises. Under the Umbrella Scheme - Blue Revolution: Integrated  
Development and Management of Fisheries, strengthening of database and GIS along with  
monitoring, control and surveillance activities are being managed. The database of fishers is  
maintained by various agencies including the Department of Fisheries, NFDB, Central Marine  
Fisheries Research Institute.

The Marine Fisheries Census is comprehensive census database which includes 11 maritime  
states and union territories. The states and union territories covered in the census were West  
Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat,  
Puducherry, Daman and Diu. The report is published by the Department of Fisheries along with  
the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. The report covers the status of marine fishery  
resources, socio-economic status of fisherfolks and infrastructure facilities existing in fishing  
villages. The aspects highlighted in the report are:

The Fisheries Resource Assessment Division of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute  
contributed significantly to improve the database management of fisheries of the country. Some  
of the notable databases, monitoring mechanisms and assessments drawn by the organization  
are^278 :

1.  Development of National Marine Fishery database using “Stratified Multistage Random  
    Sampling” which collates vital input for fish stock assessment periodically for sustained  
    marine fish production. The database is critical for policy planners, fishery managers, sea  
    food exporters and research organizations.
2.  Stock Assessment of different commercially marine fish species using six decades data  
    (1950-2010) on landings by classifying the resources into 26 groups (classified as  
    ‘abundant’ for 18 resource groups, ‘less abundant’ for 5 resource groups and 1 under each  
    of ‘declining’, ‘depleted’ and ‘collapsed’).
3.  Potential Yield and Optimum Fleet Size for the maritime states
4.  Computer Software for processing marine fish landings data, estimation of individual  
    species level landings and exporting of information into RDBMS database
5.  Fish Watch- a new system of field information dissemination for fish landing figures and  
    landing centre price range of important resources at 6 major fishing harbours of the  
    country on a near real time basis.
6.  Geo-referencing of major marine resources using satellite derived data and models.

Monitoring and evaluation projects have also been taken up by NFDB under the Blue Revolution  
scheme^279. Evaluation of the Blue Revolution projects of six states namely Assam, Tripura,  
Mizoram, Nagaland, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh have been conducted by NFDB while  
evaluation of 22 states have been conducted by external agencies in the year 2017-18.

Fisheries is an important livelihoods opportunity amongst the rural agrarian households. Among  
the households practicing livestock rearing in India, around 11%-18% of the land is used for fish  
rearing. The percentage distribution of area of land by type of animal farming as assessed in the  
NSS Livestock Ownership of India report has been shown below.

As it can be observed from the table above, the states of Jharkhand (98.10 percent) and Andhra  
Pradesh (77.76 percent) registered the highest percentage of the land used for fishery during  
Jul’12-Dec’12. During Jan’13-Jun’13, Assam (73.61 percent) and Andhra Pradesh (58.14 percent)  
were the states showing the highest percentage^280. In terms of absolute area under fisheries,  
Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam are the top states.  
**ii. Direct Indirect Employment**  
The fisheries sector has been recognised as a powerful income and employment generator by  
providing opportunities in a number of subsidiary industries and is also an instrument of

livelihood for a large section of economically backward population of the country. The direct and  
indirect employment provided by the fisheries sector in India covers 16 million fisher-folks  
across all states at the primary level and almost twice the number along the value chain.^281 The  
employment statistics include full time fisher-folks (those engaged for at least 90% of the fishable  
duration in a calendar year), part-time fisher-folks (those engaged for less than 90% of the  
fishable duration in a calendar year) as well as occasional fisher-folks (those engaged under 30%  
of their working time in fishing). The top 10 states of India in terms of employment share in  
fisheries covers more than 90% of total employment in this sector. The graph below depicts the  
share of the top 10 states.

The above graph depicts the number of fisherfolk engaged in this livelihoods in the top states in  
India. The number of fisherfolks include full time fishers, part-time fishers and occasional  
fisherfolks.

Among the fisherfolks, adult male members are usually engaged in fishing activities on full time  
or part time while a significant section of female members of the fishing households are engaged  
in fishing associated activities including marketing of fish, making/ repairing net, labourer etc.  
According to the latest Marine Census 2010, there were 864,550 marine fisher-folk households  
in the country with a total marine fisher-folk population in the country was around 4 million.  
Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Odisha accounted for 20.1%, 15.3% and 15.1% of total marine fisher-  
folks in the country respectively. In the household survey it was found that nearly 61% of the  
marine fishermen families in the country (523,691) were Below Poverty Line (BPL).

As per the estimate of Department of Fisheries, the sector is believed to have immense potential  
to double the fishers and fish farmers’ incomes by 2022. As per the income increase estimated by  
the department, the annual income has increased by 34% between 2012-13 and 201 6 - 17. The  
annual income of fisher-folks in India over the period 2011-12 and 2016-17 has been given in the  
graph below.

Among the people employed in this sector, a large percentage of the fish farmers practice  
aquaculture on a part-time basis with their involvement in the activity ranging from 17 man-days  
per annum in Karnataka to the highest of 75 man-days in West Bengal^282. An FAO study conducted  
in 6 major aquaculture producing Indian States (Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Orissa,  
Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal) have found that fish farming, though a part-time activity,  
contributes a major share of the income of these fish farmers, ranging from 14.98 percent in  
Orissa to 95.26 percent in Andhra Pradesh, with an average of 79.66 percent.^283 Shrimp farming  
has emerged as major employment generating livelihood opportunity with average labour  
requirement being 600 labour days/crop/ha as against 180 labour days/crop/ha in the case of  
paddy field cultivation^284. In the brackish water sector, hatcheries and feed mills are also  
providing excellent employment opportunities and it has been estimated that over 300 000 jobs  
have been generated in the main and supporting sectors of the shrimp aquaculture sector in rural  
areas^285. In order to protect the livelihoods of the traditional fisher-folk community, a national-  
level action plan for the sustainable development of marine fisheries attempted to solve the  
problem of overcapacity of fishing vehicles being used. The national workshop organised by  
Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), WWF-India and NITI Aayog had proposed  
for restricting the fishing rights in the sea exclusively for the fishing community dwelling in the  
coastal villages. Creation of employment opportunities and income generating avenues such as  
crab fattening, bivalve farming and ecotourism in mangrove belts for the successful execution of  
the conservation programme had been recommended as a part of the proposal^286. As observed  
from HH surveys, there has been a 24% increase in income between 2015-16 and 2018-19 among  
fisherfolks.

    Annual Income of Fisher-folks in India
    

    217
    

In the Fisheries sector, around 5.5 million women are engaged as of 2018 constituting 34% of the  
total workforce. Most of the women fisher-folks are engaged in fisheries associated activities.  
According to Marine Census 2010, nearly 81.8% of the fisher-folks engaged in marketing of fish,  
88.1% of those engaged in curing and processing and 89.6% of those engaged in peeling are found  
to be women. As per the Handbook of Fisheries 2018, Bihar has the highest share of women  
engaged in the sector (47.7%), followed by Kerala (46.9%) and Karnataka (45.8%).

Engagement of women in the fisheries sector is being strengthened through mobilizing the fisher-  
women in Self Help Groups and fishery based micro enterprises. The women led SHGs in Kerala,  
Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have taken up various activities related to  
fisheries and have been observed to have performed well. Enterprises around clam processing,  
Chinese dip net, Fish Aggregating Devices, fish drying, cage farming, ornamental fish culture, crab  
processing are some of the fisheries enterprises these women –led micro enterprises have been  
handling successfully.^287

    iv. Climate change & sustainability including adoption of climate-change resilient
    practices & diversification
    

The fisheries sector is threatened by degraded habitats, climate change and overfishing.  
Overfishing poses threat to food production as well as functioning of the ecosystem. It is  
estimated that the fraction of world marine fish stocks that are within biologically sustainable  
levels has declined from 90 percent in 1974 to 66.9 percent in 2015 implying over 1/3rd of the  
marine fish stocks are overfished.^288 Sustainable development of fisheries require proper  
management of fishing through effective harvest strategies.

Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is considered as major threat to the diminishing  
fish stocks of the ocean worldwide. The depletion of fish stocks through IUU fishing threatens

    Case Study on Mobilizing Fisheries SHG in Kerala
    Society for Assistance to Fisherwomen (SAF) in Kerala under the Department of Fisheries,
    Kerala have been working on empowering the fisher-women of the State by promoting
    livelihoods opportunity by forming SHG groups of fisher women and is one of the notable
    programs with major role in the formation of SHGs in fisheries sector. Skill development and
    capacity building of the under-employed and unemployed fisher-women was initiated to induct
    them into remunerative fishery activities. Insights into fisheries enterprises and alternate
    livelihood options were included as part of their training programme. Continuous monitoring
    and evaluation of the SHG groups with a road –map strategized along with regular performance
    appraisal helped in the women fisher folk to find new livelihood avenues and strengthened
    economic efficiency. The ‘Theeramaithry’ programme of SAF helped the economic and gender
    empowerment of women fisher folk. One of the key enterprises that is formed under SAF
    facilitation is Theeramythri sea food kitchen SHGs in various locations of Kerala.

    global food security, along with the livelihoods of some 40 million people who are employed
    worldwide in capture fishing alone, plus millions more in associated industries^289. To address the
    issue, the IUU Fishing Index^290 has been designed to meet the need for a detailed analysis of
    fishery countries’ vulnerability, exposure and responses to IUU fishing. The index benchmarks
    152 countries in terms of vulnerability, prevalence and response to IUU fishing. The parameters
    considered in the index include prevalence of IUU fishing in each country, and their vulnerability
    and response to it, drawing on various coastal, flag, port, and other state responsibilities.
    According to the IUU Fishing Index, China fared worst, with an overall score of 3.93 while Belgium
    came out with the most favourable score for all indicators combined (1.43). India with the score
    of 2.68 ranks as the 17th worse performing country among 152 countries^291. India happens to
    have a score worse than the global score, which is 2.29. One of the first binding international
    agreement developed to combat IUU fishing is the Port State Measures Agreement which came
    into force in 2016 and consists of 60 member countries. However, India is not yet part of this
    agreement.
    One of the main reasons of depleting fishing stock of the Indian marine ecosystem is attributed to
    bottom trawling. Mechanized trawlers practicing bottom trawling of the ocean floor have
    immense adverse effect on vulnerable marine ecosystems and their associated biodiversity.
    Bottom trawling exploits the fish stocks due to excess fishing effort or capacity and also destroys
    non-target species scooped from the ocean floor. The physical impact of the harmful practice
    causes damage to vulnerable ecosystem of marine biodiversity. According to United Nations^292 ,
    about 95 percent of the damage inflicted on deep water systems associated with seamounts
    results from bottom trawling.

    Artificial Reefs
    Artificial reefs (AR) are devices installed at the sea bottom to provide habitat for marine
    organisms. ARs have been found to be effective in aggregating a variety of fish species and
    in holding them by providing suitable habitats. The artificial reefs provide shelter and breeding
    grounds for majority of the fish shoals. The structures are effective in attracting moving stocks
    of high value fishes by the rich benthic fauna, crustaceans, molluscs, echinoderms, etc. The
    ARs are also effective in preventing bottom trawling by damaging nets in restricted zones.
    Installation of ARs at selected locations along the coast could be an appropriate method to
    increase fish production as well as value addition to the catch as it would increase production
    of targeted, high value fish by using non-destructive fishing gears. ARs are installed in areas
    where fishing (trawling) ban is in existence as it will not involve any destructive fishing
    methods and would enhance the livelihood security of the coastal artisanal fishers who are
    affected by the ban. Such structures are constructed and installed in Lakshadweep and Orissa
    coastal waters for repletion of fish stocks. Under RKVY Scheme, emplacement of artificial reef
    is promoted along with integrated fish farming, cage farming.

    v. Role of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) and Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan component of the
    scheme in mainstreaming of Tribal and Scheduled Caste population
    

Fishing community in India belongs to various castes. The marine fisher community in the  
maritime states belong to several castes and the inland fisher community in states like West  
Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh also come from various social  
groups distinct social, cultural governance structures and traditional practices.

Some of the important fishing castes state-wise include:

*   Tamil Nadu: Pattinavars, Mukkuvars, and Paravas
*   Andhra Pradesh: Vadabalijas, Jalaris, Pattapu, and Palles
*   Orissa: Jalaris, Vadabalijas, Kaibartas, Khandayats, and Rajbhansis
*   West Bengal: Kaibartas
*   Gujarat: Kharvas, Kolis and Macchiyaras
*   Maharashtra: Kolis
*   Karnataka: Mogaveeras
*   Kerala: Mukkuvar, Anjootty, Dheevera, and Pooislan

Traditionally most of the fishing community in India have been small scale fishers. In several  
states including Kerala, the fishers belong to different religions: Hindu, Muslim and Christians.  
However irrespective of their religion, fishers are usually recognized under the social groups of  
“Other Backward Classes”^293. The small-scale fishing communities of India often face various  
challenges owing to their low status, low incomes, poor living conditions and little political  
influence. The need for socio-economic upliftment of these poor communities has been  
recognized by the Department of Fisheries. The Department of Fisheries has earmarked Rs  
224.05 crores under which Rs 146.72 crores has been concurred under Scheduled Caste Sub Plan  
component in the year 2016- 17294. From 2018-19, the Department has allocated 8.6% under  
Tribal Sub Plan. However, the Department of Fisheries or the State Governments do not maintain  
the record of people in the different social groups.

    vi. Development, Dissemination & Adoption of Innovative Practices & Know-how and
    Use of Technology
    

Fisheries is a growing sector and with advent of new technology and innovative practices, the  
productivity of the sector can be enhanced, thus impacting the income of nearly 160 lakh people  
who are employed directly and indirectly in this domain. Institutes like ICAR - Central Marine  
Fisheries Research Institute and National Fisheries Development Board focuses on various  
upcoming technologies. The Department of Fisheries has also taken up several initiatives to  
harness full potential of the sector. During the last 4 years, the CSS Blue Revolution has resulted  
in the development of Fisheries sector both in terms of fish production and productivity, post-  
harvest infrastructure, marketing etc. Department of Fisheries has recognized the impending  
need for formulating and adopting multi-pronged strategies and focused interventions to provide  
the requisite impetus to accelerated development of Fisheries and aquaculture sector. The

    221
    

Department of Fisheries is implementing the various scheme component for enhancing fish  
production in both inland and marine sector in the following areas such as:

    (i) Re-circulatory Aquaculture System (RAS),
    (ii) Cage Culture,
    (iii) Brackish Water (including land locked Saline states),
    (iv) Cold Chain Development,
    (v) Mariculture
    (vi) Development of Ornamental Fisheries,
    (vii) Focus on Enhancement of Fingerling Production
    (viii) Development of Cold water Fisheries etc.
    (ix) Creation of Fisheries Infrastructure Facilities both in Marine and Inland Fisheries
    Sectors and
    (x) Extension of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) facilities to fishers and fish farmers.
    

Some of the key innovative practices in fisheries have been discussed below:

**Cage Culture in Fisheries:** Aquaculture has been growing significantly to cater to the increasing  
demand for fish to enhance the fish production. Two of the major strategies adopted for fish  
farming are hatchery based aquaculture and capture based aquaculture. Under capture based  
aquaculture, cage culture has emerged as a popular practice to grow fish production sustainably.  
Cage culture farming has an important role in meeting the global demand for fish products and is  
considered as one of the important alternate source to increase the aquaculture production.  
Current constraints in marine fishing such as decline in wild stock and poor return from other  
culture systems has led the fisher-folks to resort to this viable method of fish farming utilizing  
existing water resource. Fisher-folks can also select high value fish species for farming in cage  
cultures and plan the catch at the suitable time, thus increasing their returns on the investment.  
In India, fishes like, Indian sand whiting (Sillago sihama), pearl spot (Etroplus surentensis) and  
hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) are considered as popular fish varieties in states like Karnataka, Kerala  
and West Bengal, respectively and are given importance in cage culture^295. Seed production  
technology of the commercially favoured fish species can be leveraged in cage farming. Cage  
culture enables the fisher-folks to maintain an optimum stocking density, manage fish feed,  
diseases and mortality of fish. Cage culture of marine fish has grown rapidly over the last decade  
in Asia, Europe and Australia, utilizing inshore or offshore net cages and is of high monetary  
value^296. The cage farming industry, particularly in Northern Europe, North America, Chile and  
Japan, expanded dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, which attracted the interests of a  
growing number of large multinational companies seeking to diversify into a new and growing  
market with resources to carry out research and development. The practice has spread to South  
East Asian countries in the recent years and it is currently estimated that out of one million tonnes  
of marine fish cultured, around 80-90% of the catch is from cage culture.^297 Cage culture has

demonstrated that fish production is higher than fish cultured in wild by providing scope for the  
growth enhancement for the fishes cultured through feed manipulation. This finding has been  
assessed by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute on the growth potential of Asian  
seabass confirming the prospects of cage culture. Cage culture is recommended for most of the  
states practicing fishery given the constraint of land.

**mKRISHI in Fisheries** : Fish catching is a risky livelihood option given the unpredictable sea  
conditions, and is full of uncertainties along with high cost of navigation. In an endeavour to make  
fishing less hazardous for the fisherfolks, latest developments in technology is leveraged to  
mitigate their risk and address much of their safety concerns. mKRISHI® Fisheries Service  
incorporates concepts such as Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and present the fisher-folks  
with information such as Wind Speed Directions, Wave Heights, Potential Fishing Zone Map, Port  
Weather Forecast, Rain, Cyclone/Tsunami warnings etc. Mobile applications can be used by the  
fisher-folks’ local language which can work on almost all the existing GPRS enabled mobile  
devices and can function in during no/ low mobile network as well. mKRISHI® Fisheries with  
application of existing technologies thus became successful involving design thinking,  
simplification, Human Computer Interaction Service Design, GPS, data connection and content  
personalization. For the mobile signal extension in deep sea, it required antenna design, tower  
configuration and device side amplification. This selective fishing option enables the fisher-folks  
to plan their fishing trips or navigation beforehand and have brought a disciplined approach,  
which not only led to less expenditure but also less diesel consumption and carbon emissions.  
According to information collected in Maharashtra (Raigad district), this technology adoption has  
led to a 30-40% increase in catch and 30% reduction in diesel consumption. Based on the survey  
conducted in Raigad by Mumbai Research Center of ICAR-CMFRI during 2013-14, it was observed  
that at 15% adoption level, fishermen can save up to 900,000 of litres (@30% less consumption).

**Fishing Using Lights:** One of the innovative methods of fishing is by using lights under water. In  
some of the most productive methods of fishing such as purse-seines, stick-held dipnets, and  
squid jigging uses artificial light. In purse-seine fisheries surface and underwater lamps are used,  
while only surface lamps are used for stick-held dipnet targeting Pacific saury and squid jigging  
fisheries. The underwater light attracts fish, driven by certain behavioural/ physiological factors.  
The principles for light aggregation of fish are:

    − Schooling for feeding
    − Conditioned response to light intensity gradients
    − Curiosity behaviour and other social behaviour
    − Positive photoaxis making them orient to the light source
    − Optimum light intensity for feeding and other activities
    − Disorientation and immobilization due to high light levels in surrounding dark
    conditions
    It is a popular method of fishing practiced in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand as well
    as certain parts of Europe. It helps in getting bigger catches by avoiding light competitions within
    sectors and conflicts between sectors. The technology has been further improvised with the
    advent of cheaper LED (Light Emitting Diode) technology replacing much costlier metal halide
    and halogen lamps. These new energy efficient light sources are continuing to develop and may
    be used to develop energy efficient and environmentally friendly fishing technologies for existing
    

    223
    

    light fisheries. The shift to LED lights has resulted in considerable fuel saving for light fishing
    vessels. This technology has been recently adopted in India (in 2014) and is mainly prevalent in
    Karnataka and Goa. Several pilot programs have been conducted by CMFRI9 and FSI/CIFNET10
    targeting coastal squid resources.^298 Between 2014 and 2016, more than 50 light fishing
    operations have been carried out and purse-seining and gillnetting were found to be the suitable
    methods for fishing using lights. Fishing using lights has been classified as low-impact fisheries
    with the ability to reduce bycatch and may in addition lead to a cleaner catch.
    The HH Survey reveals the improvement in fishing technology being implemented by the
    fisherfolks. The graph below displays the findings.

    As it can be observed from the graph, only 12% of fisherfolks have been able to implement
    improvements in fishing technology.
    Observations from the HH Survey brings out the usage of devices by fisherfolks to reduce
    bycatch. The graph below shows the findings.

    vii. Stakeholder and beneficiary behavioural change
    

Lack of responsible fishing with unregulated penetration of advanced, yet not necessarily eco-  
friendly, harvesting technologies have been leading to continuous depletion of natural resources  
of marine as well as inland water bodies. In order to stem the problem of overfishing, a  
sustainable fishing system is being brought in and inducted with all stakeholders of fisheries  
including the fisherfolks and all others involved in the fishing, post-harvest processing and  
marketing of fish. India’s agreement with the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries  
(CCRF) requires the sector to implement approaches to prevent serious and irreversible  
environmental degradation. It is required to sensitize them on issues such as severe decline or  
absence of native fish species, decline in the size range of major species, excessive catch of  
juveniles, increase in fishing time and distance, and changes in species composition. The  
behavioural changes among stakeholder engaged in fisheries can be brought in through  
awareness building on concepts like maintenance of maximum sustainable yield, stock  
assessment parameters, need for licensing of fleets, adherence to practices like monsoon trawling  
ban, maintaining mesh size regulations etc. The long term socio-economic impact of overfishing  
and competitive fishing on the livelihoods of the fisher community is being transferred to the  
fisher communities by CMFRI through various communication tools and strategies. One of the  
first steps taken by the CMFRI has been to launch a state-wide campaign on Responsible Fisheries  
in Kerala. CMFRI developed training modules and animation films targeted towards the fisher  
community, covering topics on ecological impacts of continued over-fishing.

The ornamental fish business is considered and being promoted by the Department of Fisheries  
as an excellent source of livelihoods for fish farmers. The department has been aiming to  
encourage captive breeding of ornamental fish for sustainable growth, livelihood improvement  
and to enhance foreign exchange through exports. During 2017-18, setting up of 308 ornamental  
fish units was initiated along with conducting capacity building programmes in the states of  
Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.

    Focus on wetland fishing in the floodplains of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Manipur,
    Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya is being done to empower the local fisher
    communities. Pen/cage culture of fish along with effective management of aquatic weeds and
    rational stocking of selected fast growing fish species in the floodplains have enhanced
    livelihoods of fisherfolks in the interior landscapes. Significant effort and financial assistance have
    been given by ICAR-Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute to promote wetland fishing across
    several wetlands in Bihar in the year 2017-18.
    In order to optimally use the water resources, cage culture is promoted among fisherfolks. Cage
    aquaculture assists harvest of fish in in existing water resources while being enclosed in a net
    cage which allows free flow of water. Various technologies of cage culture have been standardised
    and popularised by CMFRI and CIFRI to be used by fisherfolks in open sea, brackish water,
    reservoirs, rivers and lakes^299. This low impact farming practice have been demonstrated by the
    resource organizations, CMFRI and CIFRI in various states including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
    Tamil Nadu, and Manipur. Fisherfolks of Jharkhand and Kerala have taken up the practice
    commercially.
    

**viii. Research & Development**

    In fisheries and aquaculture sector, continuous research and emerging technologies are being
    attempted to ensure fishing as a safer livelihoods option with precise and predictable outcome.
    Disruptive technologies are providing ways to gather and store information, adhere to
    compliances regarding regulations and traceability to ensure sustainable management of
    resources. Globally in the fisheries sector, disruptive technologies such as mobile internet,
    advanced robotics, and the “Internet of Things”, or interconnectedness among systems have
    found solutions in this domain.
    India, being one of the largest fish producing nations in the world has been focusing on research
    and development in this sector to increase productivity while creating work opportunities in
    fishing, post-harvesting and other affiliated operations. ICAR, the nodal agency for agricultural
    research in India, has eight fisheries research institutes of which four are mainly responsible for
    research into aquaculture:
    

*   Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture, Bhubaneswar
*   Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture, Chennai
*   Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Kochi
*   Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute, Barrackpore  
    In addition to the above institutes, the National Research Centre for Coldwater Fisheries in  
    Bhimtal contributes to research on cold water fisheries and aquaculture. Critical technologies  
    developed in these institutes have been implemented across the country. Over the years, ICAR  
    has launched several other programmes to develop greater research-farmer interaction including  
    the Lab-to-Land Programme, the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) Rural  
    Aquaculture Projects, the Institutions-Village-Linkage Programme, etc.  
    In 2018, several critical developments have been made in the fisheries sector spearheaded by  
    ICAR. Large-scale stocking of carp seeds in Ganga river has been done to rejuvenate the dwindling  
    population affected by various anthropogenic activities. Cage culture in inland open water bodies

is being pursued to assess its socio-economic impact and improvement in yield. Several  
endeavours to improve the health of fish stocks are being done. Detection of parasitic diseases in  
prawns, development of tilapia lake virus detection kit and vaccine against viral infection of  
brackish and freshwater fish have been done. Cadalmin, a nutraceutical product has been  
produced from extractions of seaweeds. CIFTest, a consumer friendly test kit was developed to  
detect formaldehyde levels in water. The frontline practitioners to the fishers demonstrated the  
innovative solutions intended to be disseminated among the fisherfolks. Around 2329 fish  
farmers have been benefited in 2018 through the frontline dissemination.

In the future research focus, ICAR intends to explore emerging technologies in ecosystem-based  
approach to coastal as well as riverine aquaculture to arrest the accelerating loss of fish stock.  
The focus areas of research in fisheries would include species diversification, aquaculture based  
on biofloc technology, food value chain, large-scale precision farming green fishing vessels,  
effective phytosanitary regimes, and epidemiological information.

    ix. Reforms and Regulations
    

The fisheries resources are maintained through various regulatory tools and measures directed  
towards limiting rate of extraction and ensuring a sustainable stock in its reserves. The regulatory  
measures are built around the concept of maximum sustainable yield which is the maximum level  
at which a resource can be routinely exploited without long-term depletion. A new concept has  
been introduced in fisheries called maximum economic yield that defined the level of harvest or  
effort that maximizes the sustainable net returns from fishing, which has become a guiding  
principle behind fishing regulations followed globally^300. Approaches of fishing regulation can be  
classified as:

*   Access-control based
*   Output/catch based
*   Input/effort based
*   Temporal (mainly seasonal bans)
*   Spatial (locational restrictions to minimize destruction to sensitive stocks)

Marine capture fisheries regulations in India are in place from the pre-independence era,  
followed by several new regulations. Demarcation of maritime zones for fishing and ocean  
administration is ensured through the following two laws:

*   The Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and other  
    Maritime Zones Act, 1976
*   Maritime Zones of India (Regulation of Fishing by Foreign Vessels) Act, 1981.

Some of the more recent regulations and laws include The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ)  
notification, 1991; New Deep Sea Fishing Policy, 1991; Biological Diversity Act, 2002;  
Comprehensive Marine Fisheries Policy, 2004 and National Policy on Marine Fisheries, 2017. The  
most recent policy, National Policy on Marine Fisheries, 2017 aims to ensure the healthy and  
ecological integrity of the marine fisheries resources of India’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)

    227
    

through sustainable harvests, socio-economic upliftment of fishers, principle of subsidiarity,  
partnership, inter-generational equity, gender justice and precautionary approach^301.

As per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, the states have the jurisdiction to govern  
fishing and fisheries in the territorial waters, whereas the union government reserves its  
jurisdiction beyond territorial waters, i.e., between 12 nm and 200 nm. The marine activities are  
governed by the Marine Fisheries Regulatory Acts (MFRAs) of the respective maritime states.  
MFRAs are effective in regulating fishing within the territorial waters and they include required  
legislations to make use of a variety of regulatory approaches such as access control, input/ effort-  
based restrictions, spatial as well as temporal restrictions.^302

Alongside the formal and institutional regulatory mechanisms, a number of sui generis regulatory  
and co-management systems are instrumental in various parts of coastal India. These traditional  
community-based governance models are highly dynamic and adaptive to the technological  
improvements of the recent times, yet they are not officially recognized and have little legal  
sanctity.^303

    Recently, Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) - a scheme to bring about Blue
    Revolution through sustainable and responsible development of fisheries sector in India, has
    been launched in May 2020. The scheme aims to enhance fish production to 220 lakh metric tons
    by 2024-25 from 137.58 lakh metric tons in 2018-19 at an average annual growth rate of about
    9%. Moreover, the scheme is expected to result in doubling export earnings to Rs. 1,00,000 crore
    and generate about 55 lakhs direct and indirect employment opportunities in fisheries sector
    over a period of next five years. A brief analysis of components of old scheme (IDMF) continued
    as a part of new scheme in the department (PMMSY and FIDF) is provided below^304.
    

*   Components of old scheme (IDMF) have been adequately covered in the PMMSY,  
    however, detailed cost norms for each component are missing. Preparation of detailed  
    cost norms for each activity will help in better planning and effective implementation of  
    the new scheme.

*   The implementation structure of the scheme needs to be clearly defined including the  
    structure, roles and responsibilities of central apex committee, PMU, state and district  
    level units.
*   Provision for technical experts and project management staff needs to be suitably  
    introduced in the scheme.
*   Affordable brood and seed, fish feed, stocking of fish fingerlings and sea cultivation  
    appears to be important areas and form key part of recommendations to meet sectoral  
    challenges. A minimum percentage of funds may be fixed for these interventions under  
    PMMSY with clearly defined targets.
*   The post-harvest losses and issues vary across the across regions and there is need to  
    promote region specific strategy. The PMMSY scheme consists of a wide range of  
    activities, these activities can be prioritized across different regions based on immediate  
    requirements.
*   During proposal submission stage by states, the states can be asked to align proposed  
    interventions with the major challenges that are being faced in their region and submit a  
    plan for addressing these challenges.
*   The annual support for fisherfolks may be increased to at least Rs. 6000 per year in-line  
    with support that is provided to farmers in PM-KISAN scheme. This component is  
    suggested to be separated from the scheme. All fisherfolks can be made part of the existing  
    central sector scheme and 100% support may be provided to the fisherfolks.
*   Considering that overexploitation is a major issue, the envisaged targets of enhanced  
    production from 13.75 million metric tons to 22 million metric tonnes need to consider  
    its environmental impacts. Reassessment of targets may be made on a periodic basis and  
    these targets can be aligned to output/ outcome indicators to assess the overall impact of  
    the scheme.
*   Some of the activities under the scheme can be complemented with existing mangrove  
    restoration activities in states, regions where mangrove restoration interventions are  
    going on may be prioritized for interventions.
*   Scheme monitoring framework needs to be defined. There is need to make provision for  
    baseline, midline and endline assessment to assess effectiveness of scheme at different  
    stages of implementation.
*   Marketing and processing of fish and fish products has improved in recent years,  
    however, it remains an important component for boosting the income of fishing populace  
    and needs to be provided attention during prioritization of interventions.  
    **x. Impact on and role of private sector, community/ collectives/ cooperatives (e.g.  
    Farmer cooperatives, FPOs, Water User Associations, etc.) and civil society in the  
    scheme**

Fisherfolks in India are mostly small scale fish farmers with limited capacity to expand their  
operations and little access to market. The challenges faced by the fisherfolks include lack of  
physical and livelihood assets such as land which can be used as collateral. They are often not  
functionally organized and dispersed, thus not capable of economies of scale in production,

    229
    

marketing, and post-harvest operations.^305 In order to collectivize the small fish farmers, self-  
help groups, producer organizations and cooperatives are being formed in each state. As per the  
Marine Census 2010, nearly 32% of adult fisherfolks have memberships in co-operatives, in  
which 22.1% had memberships in fisheries co-operatives and 9.9% had memberships in other  
co-operatives. The state-wise details of marine co-operatives among the 9 maritime states and 2  
union territories is given below:

Promotion and development of fishery cooperative movement in India is pursued by the National  
Federation of Fishers Cooperatives Ltd. (FISHCOPFED) which is the apex institution of Indian  
Fisheries Cooperative Movement. FISHCOPFED is well promoted through schemes and funds of  
the Department of Fisheries, Govt. of India, National Cooperative Development Cooperation and  
National Fisheries Development Board.^306 Under FISHCOPFED, there are over 18 thousand  
primary fisheries cooperative societies under which around 3 lakh fisherfolks are organized.  
FISHCOPFED is instrumental in providing insurance to fisherfolks, conduct regular training  
program for fishers, and also enabling post-harvest operations in fishery such as providing  
market linkage for several states. FISHCOPFED aims to expand its reach to the fishers by  
providing better fish marketing solutions through establishing wholesale fish market, start  
mobile fish retail marketing, and establish cold chain solutions.

Some of the state’s fisheries cooperative federations have also helped in organizing and  
strengthening the small scale fish farmers. Some of the notable state fisheries cooperative  
federations are Matsyafed, the Kerala State Co-operative Federation for Fisheries Development  
Ltd, TAFCOFED or Tamil Nadu State Apex Fisheries Co-operative Federation Limited and AFCOF  
or Andhra Pradesh State Fishermen Cooperative Societies Federation Limited.

Matsyafed provides various socio-economic services to the fisher community and has formed  
more than 15000 SHGs in the state of Kerala. TAFCOFED has 483 Primary Fishermen Co-  
operative Societies, 171 Fisherwomen co-operative societies, 151 Inland Co-operative societies  
and 9 district Fisherwomen Co-operative Federations. The institution has been actively  
promoting production, procurement, processing and marketing of fish and fish products as well

as implement welfare programme for the economic and social development of fisher community.  
AFCOF also functions on the same lines, undertaking procurement of fish, and establishing cold  
storage plants and net making plants.

### 1.3 Issues and Challenges

Some of the key issues and challenges that impact the development of the sector including  
improved productivity and restrict income of fish farmers have been elaborated below.

    Problem of Marine Debris Accumulation: Influx of marine debris in coastal waters of India is
    a major impediment for the fisher-folks operating their fishing gears. Lack of proper solid waste
    management protocols in the coastal areas of the country has been affecting the quantity of solid
    waste entering the coastal waters through rivers, and interlinked canals of major estuarine
    systems along the Indian coast. The current practice of fisher-folks of throwing back litters to the
    water aggravate the problem. The debris collection in the water has been affecting the entire
    marine food web including plankton, mussels, clams, oysters and all kinds of fish ingesting the
    contaminated marine organisms. According to researchers conducted by CMFRI, micro and
    macro plastics are often found in the guts of fish catch and the plastics ingestion is increasing
    over the years^307. Littering in the coastal areas is also affecting the coral reefs which support the
    livelihoods of several thousand of fishers. Abandoned and lost fishing gears add to the woes of
    debris being collated affecting the benthic habitat and the marine biota. Lack of practices to
    manage, retrieve and recycle the derelict fishing gears lost during calamities or discarded along
    the coast is the primary reason behind the accumulation of debris owing to fishing. To address
    this issue, awareness on retrieving the nets and gears is required to be generated among fisher-
    folks to bring back the damaged gear and dispose them on land. Along with awareness of fisher-
    folks, awareness of tourists in the coastal tourism areas is also critically important since debris
    tend to accumulate in tourism spots and during festival times. Protection of the marine
    ecosystem is critical by managing the debris collection.
    Lack of Social Protection of Fishers: Traceability on Aquaculture and Vessel Monitoring
    System: Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) is a real-time tracker of marine vessels and is a cost-
    effective tool for the successful monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) of fisheries activities.
    VMS provides a fishery management agency with accurate and timely information about the
    location and activity of regulated fishing vessels. The VMS consists of continuous monitoring
    equipment installed on fishing vessels, which records and transmits satellite information on the
    vessel’s geographic position, course and speed to a Fisheries Control and Monitoring Center
    (FCMC) in real-time every 2 h^308. The Vessel Monitoring System can regulate Illegal, Unreported,
    or Unregulated (IUU) fishing activities, one of the high risk areas in fisheries. Information
    collected by the Vessel Monitoring system can be used for inspection, monitoring, traceability
    and control of fishing activities. A VMS is essential for the country like India having over 2 million
    km^2 of the sea space. In India, although implementation of Vessel Monitoring System had been
    initiated, it is yet to be implemented across the country. In light of this issue of incomplete
    implementation of VMS by all the coastal states, registration of new vessels were stopped to
    resolve the issue of unmonitored vessel movement and growing overcapacity in the sector. In a
    recent enquiry constituted by the Government of India into the loss suffered due to discrepancies
    in the policy of issuing LOP (Letter of Permit) Scheme for the fisheries sector, implementation of

    VMS in India was reiterated. It was recommended that mid-sea trans-shipments of catch should
    not be allowed, until a system of at-sea monitoring through Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and
    posting an independent on-board observer is ensured.
    Social protection to fisherfolks has been analysed from the HH Survey. The analysis reveals the
    social support availed by fisherfolks and compensation received by fisherfolks during fishing ban
    periods. The graphs below depicts the findings.

    Slow Development of Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS): Recirculating aquaculture
    systems (RAS) are tank-based systems in which fish can be grown at high density under
    controlled environmental conditions and ensuring water quality management. RAS is considered
    to be one of the most efficient systems being environmentally sustainable, using 90-99 percent
    less water than other aquaculture systems^309. RAS can also reduce the discharge of waste, the
    need for antibiotics or chemicals used to combat disease, and fish and parasite escapes.
    Hatcheries with RAS facility are often fully closed and entirely controlled, making them mostly
    biosecure - diseases and parasites cannot often get in. Although RAS is commonly used for
    freshwater environment, it can also be used for marine environment. However, this system is
    expensive and requires constant monitoring to avoid catastrophic losses. Energy efficiency of the
    system is a critical aspect requiring considerable investment along with checks on water levels,
    disruption of electric power, fire, smoke and intrusion of vandals. In order to make RAS
    biosecure, it is important to disinfect the RAS water to avoid any contamination through
    chemicals, drugs or antibiotics. Another key issue in RAS is related to the solid removal in
    recirculating systems. The presence and accumulation of particulate wastes in RAS (faeces,
    uneaten feed, and bacterial flocs) will negatively impact the water quality by affecting the
    performance efficiency of the water treatment units. Hence, it is required to filter the water using
    drum filters, bead filters, screen filters and rapid sand filters. In India, this technology is the need
    of the hour but yet to be taken up at a large scale. Lack of stricter water pollution regulations in
    India has been one of the impediments to bring this technology to use. This system also requires
    high investment cost on technology and is dependent on constant source of power which are
    some of the main causes from slower implementation of RAS technology in India^310.
    Establishment of RAS requires good knowledge base among fish farmers about emerging and
    future technologies in aquaculture which is currently lacking.

    Overfishing and Resource Exploitation: Deep sea fishing, motorized fishing and trawling has
    been some of the key reasons of overfishing and resource exploitation in the Indian fisheries.
    Deep sea fishing has led to fast depletion of fish in the marine waters. The concern had been
    expressed by an Expert Committee of Indian Council of Agricultural Research in 2014 while
    examining the existing Marine Fishing Policy. The findings of the committee reported that fish
    production in India from the near-shore waters has plateaued and that there is very little scope
    for increasing production in waters up to a depth of 200 metres. The reports found that
    exploitation of resources in waters between 200 m and 500 m was at initial stage owing to small
    fishing boats [mainly measuring between 15 m and 20 m] targeting the resources in this area.
    Inadequate capacities of implementing a stringent Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS)
    regime leads to inefficient management of deep sea resources. Information on scientific and
    technical information on the commercial fisheries resources can ensure sustainable fishing.
    Depletion of fish resources is also attributed highly to factors like mechanization in fishing.
    Trawling, purse seining and gillnetting are the most commercial and destructive fishing methods
    in the country and have resulted in overfishing and resource depletion. Trawling has been the
    most energy intensive fishing method and the exploitation of resources is directly related to the
    size of the trawlers preferred as well as the number of hours of operations. Bull trawling is
    considered as one of the most intensive trawling mechanism that causes huge damage to seabed.
    Pelagic trawling, although banned in 1980s, is still practiced in the country total damage to fish
    species and other marine organisms^311. Destructive fishing practices like the use of small mesh
    or mini trawl which has mesh sizes as small as 16 mm and is operated in the shallow coastal
    waters ends up catching mainly the juvenile prawns and fish. Lack of regulations on fishing gears
    (recommended mesh size and dimension) and boatyards have aggravated the issue. In order to
    end resource exploitation, it is critically important to educate fisher-folks about all the
    destructive fishing practices and bring about behaviour change.
    Inadequate Marketing Infrastructure
    The fish market system is a traditional and informal setup and does not have adequate
    infrastructural support across the country. This lacuna has been one of the strong observations
    in the Doubling Farmers’ Income report of Niti Aayog published in 2017. Domestic fish market
    is driven by fisherfolks and private traders only with hinterland demand remaining untested due
    to insufficient cold-chain connectivity. The perishable nature of fish and the time lag to transport
    the fresh catch from the fish landing centres to the interior markets is one of the key challenges
    in the current fish markets in the country. The harvested fish is not evenly distributed to interior
    areas due to lack of refrigerated transportation. Due to lack of monitoring in the entire value
    chain, there are considerable compromises on the quantity and type of ice used in the
    refrigerated transport modes (reefer containers or trucks), putting the hygiene and food safety
    at risk. The handling facilities are also poor. Availability of potable water, good quality ice,
    electricity, waste disposal system, etc. is inadequate, affecting consumer acceptance and demand
    for fish from hinterland population^312.
    Fish Feed and Hatcheries : Freshwater aquaculture is highly dependent on input availability for
    breeding stocks. Traditionally breeding of fish stocks were done with fish seeds collected from
    the natural water bodies. However, this method has not been effective to meet the demand. The
    collection season has been short and the quantity of the annual collection fluctuated
    

311

Niti Aayog. 2017. Doubling Farmers’ Income – Volume IV, Chapter 11 Livestock and Fisheries Marketing

    233
    

    considerably with the variation of environmental conditions. Deterioration of river
    environments has resulted in quick decline in both quantity and quality of collection^313. To
    address this issue, fish hatcheries have to be established to increase the seed production.
    However, the hatcheries in India lack proper technology to produce quality fish seeds. There are
    around 1784 hatcheries of various sizes which are located across different states^314. Although
    the hatcheries can provide adequate fish seeds, the quality of fish seeds need to improve. Quality
    of fish seeds is one of the major bottleneck in vannamei shrimp production. The seed production
    technologies of some high value fish like murrels, mahseer, pearl spot, koi, pangassius are yet to
    be standardized/ commercialised. The state run seed farms also need to be strengthened^315.
    There is lack of quality brood stock to supply to the hatcheries catering to all types of fish breeds.
    Modern hatcheries have not developed in-line with the requirement because they are technology
    and capital intensive.
    Lack of Credit and Insurance Coverage : The fisheries sector is dependant largely on informal
    credit. There is lack of credit availability from the formal sector, particularly for marine and
    aquaculture. Investment in aquaculture is perceived to be risky leading to limits of credit
    exposure. There is also lack of awareness among the branch level bankers on the aquaculture
    technologies and their techno-economic feasibilities^316. There are gaps in the institutional
    lending, with no incentives like interest subvention being provided for working capital in many
    states. The sector lacks proper insurance coverage as well. Insurance facility for the marine
    fisheries assets and aquaculture assets and standing crops are charged very high premium
    without any subvention by the Government^317.
    

    It has been observed in the HH Survey that awareness of insurance and adoption of insurance is
    very low. The graphs below depicts the findings.
    

Source: HH Survey, Deloitte Analysis

As it can be observed from the graphs above that there are only 20% of respondents aware about  
insurance and around 25% have availed insurance among fisherfolks.

Chapter 2: Sector Level Recommendations: Fisheries

### 2.1 Recommendations at Sectoral Level

Post consultations with the department officials at central, state and district level; sector experts;  
and our analysis of the issues and challenges faced by the fisheries sector, the recommendations  
and solutions have been provided below across the Value Chain.

**Production**

*   There is a shortage of hatcheries and cost-efficient feed which results in a shortage of  
    quality fingerlings. Therefore, it is suggested to strengthen/ increase the number of  
    hatcheries and feed mills.
*   Promoting the use of floating pen and river cage based fish farming in perennial rivers on  
    the lines of similar practices in countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, etc. Promoting the  
    cultivation of sea weeds and mussels.  
    Box 24 : Tilapia Cage Farming in Vietnam

    Tilapia Cage Farming in Vietnam
    Background: Cultivation of fish in cages is a dominant type of freshwater aquaculture
    in the southern provinces of Vietnam and the Mekong Delta. Due to limited land
    availability, cage culture of fish has expanded by effectively taking full advantage of the
    available water resources.
    Impact : Tilapia cage farms are the most popular freshwater cultivation practice which
    has contributed substantially to livelihoods, food demand and poverty alleviation.
    Effects : Deterioration in water quality and fish mortalities
    Solution:
    

*   Better management practices such as improvements to the cage designs,  
    checking seed quality at stocking, monitoring water quality and fish health,  
    improving bio-security during production, keeping records and a proactive  
    approach to health management.
*   Use of new advanced techniques: high-density polyethylene (HDPE) floating  
    cages and nets with anti-fouling coatings, based on Norwegian technology. The  
    floating cages can endure winds and waves, are easy to move, and can breed a  
    large quantity of fish. They are convenient for checking and harvesting fish.
*   Leading to increase in the quality of fish and other aquatic species bred in floating  
    cages.
*   The Government has advised fish farmers to pay attention to the quality of fish  
    seed and market demand.
*   The department is also building a brand name for the province’s fish bred in  
    floating cages so they can be sold directly to wholesale markets and  
    supermarkets. This would add more income for farmers.  
    **Learnings** :  
    Similarly, customized model can be adopted in India, wherein, the floating cages can be  
    located in sea areas far from shore and have clean water, preventing pollution and  
    disease among fish.

    to-breed-fish-in-cages.html

    235
    

*   There is a need for customizing the RAS/ Biofloc technology through R&D efforts in the  
    community ponds and water bodies for enhanced productivity and reduced investments.

Box 25 : The Netherlands: Managing Ecosystem Impacts in Aquaculture through RAS

*   Develop and rollout podcast for capacity building on pond management and hygiene and  
    sanitation practices.
*   Aggressive promotion of shrimp and pearl cultivation through reclamation of low-lying  
    areas under saline/ sodic soils, as is happening in Haryana and Punjab.
*   Diversification into fast growing species like Tilapia, Cobia, Asian Seabass, etc.
*   Focus on capacity building of fishers on fish farm/ fish pond management, hygiene and  
    sanitation aspects of the catch.

    The Netherlands: Managing Ecosystem Impacts in Aquaculture through RAS
    Background : The Dutch finfish aquaculture sector is unique in the World and based solely on
    RAS. The sector was developed with the application of RAS in the seventies and eighties, and
    nearly exclusively applies RAS technology in indoor farming systems for several species, such
    as African catfish, eel, tilapia, sturgeon, pikeperch, barramundi, turbot, sole, yellowtail kingfish
    and others.
    Advantages of RAS : RAS offers a variety of benefits to fish producers in comparison to open
    pond cultures. Some of them are listed below.
    

*   Maximizes production on a limited supply of water.
*   Low land requirements.
*   Ability to control water temperature.
*   Independence from adverse weather conditions.
*   Nearly complete environmental control to maximize fish growth.  
    **Environment and Ecological Sustainability in The Netherlands** : From an environmental  
    point of view the input into RAS is mainly fish, nutrients water and energy. The nutrient retention  
    by fish inside a RAS is more efficient compared to other husbandry organisms in other animal  
    production systems.  
    RAS systems are more efficient in terms of water use. The most important output of the  
    operation are fish as end product and the emitted nutrients as a waste product. Compared to  
    ponds, RAS emits waste from the system in higher concentrations and at clearly defined emission  
    points which allows for easier waste management.  
    The environmental impact of RAS is rather limited as normally end-of-pipe treatments are  
    included in the system setup.  
    New technologies are focusing on the integration of low trophic species converting the fish sludge  
    into valuable secondary products e.g. other fish species, worms, algae, etc. The generated  
    sludge, bioflocs, are reused then as fish feed.  
    Comparison of catfish RAS in Netherlands with pangasius culture in Vietnam shows lower CO2  
    emissions from Dutch production during production and processing processes, including feed  
    production.  
    **Learnings** : Government may support and/ or encourage research and pilot projects using RAS/  
    biofloc technology. This may include partnering with large scale fish farmers through production  
    agreements. Moreover, some of existing facilities used for demonstration may be upgraded into  
    commercial fish farms and leased out to a group of entrepreneurs.

*   The fish is susceptible to diseases due to contagious nature and mortality in fish is noticed  
    often due to poor management of ponds and hatcheries. Therefore, the ponds need to be  
    limed and fertilized at regular intervals to maintain optimum water quality and load of  
    fish food organisms.

**Processing and Value Addition**

*   Development of fish filleting and ready to cook fish products manufacturing facilities^319.
*   Promoting the development of inland fish landing/ aggregation centres with ice plants/  
    ice flaking machinery (regular monitoring and treatment of water quality).
*   Creation of fish waste management systems at all major fish markets including facilities  
    for manufacturing by-products like Chitin, Chitosan, Fish meal, Fish oil, etc.
*   Strong cold chain network needs to be developed to displace the age-old practice of  
    transportation of fish under ice and covered with saw dust which leads to higher chances  
    of contamination.
*   Need to invest and train the fisher folks on quality assurance practices mainly on hygiene  
    and sanitation which have a strong linkage to the quality of the product. This would not  
    only ensure better quality of the product but also increased shelf life and better price  
    realization.

**Marketing**

*   GI tagging for some of the fish species like rainbow trout, Hilsa, etc. for higher value  
    creation.
*   Linking fishermen collectives with e-commerce players in the sector such as Jalongi,  
    Fresh-to-Home, Licious, Fresh Fish Market, etc.
*   Conduct periodic fairs and events at global level for promotion of Indian variety of fishes,  
    which will lead to increase in exports.

**Research and Development**

*   Promoting the development of low-cost quality feed as it comprises around 70% of the  
    cost of production.
*   Promoting innovations for adaptation of newer, intensive farming technologies like RAS/  
    Biofloc in community ponds/ water bodies.

*   Products branded specific to region, providing choice to customers.
*   Presence in major Tier-1 cities.
*   Delivered at customer’s home, no need to visit wet fish markets.  
    **Domestic Consumption per year** :
*   Fish & Seafood: INR 65,000 crore, Meat & Poultry: INR 1,50,000 crore  
    Source: https://www.newsbarons.com/retail/scaleing-the-fish-business/

237  
Sector Report: Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries

*   Promoting timetable based action led research on development of newer fast growing  
    disease resistant varieties/ species of fish.
*   Undertaking R&D for development of processed products from fresh water fish species.
*   Development of new varieties/ species for cold water fisheries.
*   Promoting innovations to capture the potential of riverine fisheries.

**Policy Level Interventions**

*   There is a need to develop a uniform policy across the country governing fresh water  
    aquaculture incorporating guidelines and best management practices for the same. These  
    could address areas of management of common water resources, incentivizing fish  
    production at individual level, promoting the development of fishermen collectives (FFDA  
    is one of the initiatives currently being undertaken).
*   There is a need for having special package for development of cold water fisheries in  
    specific parts of the country.
*   There is a need for exploring the potential of insurance as one of the social safety net tools  
    (widely adopted across the world) for containing and mitigating variety of risks such as  
    asset risks, production and management risks, market risks and personal and health  
    risks^320 , as the risk financing behaviour of Indian fishermen is very low.  
    Box 26 : Key Suggested Reforms for Increasing Adoption of Insurance in Fisheries
*   The terms of auction/ allocation of community ponds/ water bodies may be revisited to  
    enable small and marginal fishermen gain the rights over fishing in these community  
    ponds/ water bodies.
*   It is recommended to explore the potential of expanding the scope of minimum support  
    price to fish catch as well.

**Key Suggested Reforms for Increasing Adoption of Insurance in Fisheries**  
Innovative products such as weather-index based insurance schemes are already in  
force in the agriculture sector, wherein, satellite data and inputs from weather  
stations are being used to trigger insurance payments in case of occurrence of  
weather related events. These can be extended to the fisheries sector as well, to  
increase efficiency and simplify procedures.  
The inputs from such platforms could be used for compensating damages to coastal  
assets of fisher folk, marine cages, and other fishery-related infrastructure.  
Similarly, advanced vessel monitoring systems (VMS), could be used to track the  
fishing vessels and assess incidents such as mid-sea capsizing and collisions. Such  
data would be valuable for the insurance companies to verify insurance claims by  
affected beneficiaries.  
Further, interactive ICT tools and mobile applications could be leveraged for speedy  
processing of insurance claims as well as for real-time assessment of damages  
incurred to fishing vessels and mariculture units in case of calamities.

    238
    

*   There is a need to develop an on-going real time surveillance mechanism linked to early  
    warning systems for diseases in fishes to take pre-emptive measures. A real-time MIS with  
    open access should be developed which would support the disease control interventions.

    Key Recommendations at the Sector Level for Achieving Transformational
    Improvements Across the Value Chain
    

*   Exploit untapped potential of brackish water resources to increase production –  
    currently only 14% of the 1.2 mn Ha available under brackish water is being utilized.
*   Capacity building of the fish farmers to promote high input – high stocking systems  
    which uses intensive supplementary balanced diet feeding along with increased/  
    intensive aeration and replenishment of the water bodies. Through implementation of  
    such systems, the production can be increased to 10-15 tonnes/ Ha/ year from 3- 5  
    tonnes/ Ha/ year.
*   Higher financial incentives can be considered for aiding capital investment like  
    raceways for trouts, fish pond rejuvenation, etc.
*   Development of logistics network for transportation of live fish – which is gaining  
    market traction and attracts premium.
*   Lack of dynamic market intelligence is one of the major constraints affecting adequate  
    returns to fishermen. There is a need to set up a dynamic market intelligence on the  
    lines of commodity portals for players to have real time updated information on  
    demand and prices for fish species at major markets in the vicinity.
*   Development of low-cost production technologies for production of feed and/ or  
    nutritional products for both humans and animals from sea weed, algae, etc.
*   To provide social protection of fishers, explore the potential of universalizing the  
    financial support during lean months under the National Savings-cum-Relief Scheme  
    as being implemented by Tamil Nadu Government with fisher folks in Gulf of Mannar.
*   Technical support groups involving multi-disciplinary team needs to be created for  
    project management, planning and implementation at the central and state level. Fixed  
    term contracts/ tenures for scheme level officials for 3-4 years with yearly  
    performance linked appraisal may be introduced for higher accountability.

**Change in Key Indicators for the Sector**

As highlighted in sectoral analysis, the increased focus of government on strengthening the  
fisheries sector has resulted in increase in India’s fish production at a CAGR of 7.1% during 2014-  
15 to 2017-18. The growth in aquaculture and deep-sea fishing owing to changing consumer  
preferences, use of technology, and government initiatives is likely to spur India towards its aim  
of doubling farmers’ income. However, to achieve this, there has to be concerted efforts towards  
technology use in the sector, specifically, capture fisheries. Lack of processing facilities, limited  
value addition in products, and insufficient storage infrastructure are some of the constraints  
hindering the country to derive full potential from its fishing resources. Moreover, a significant  
difference has been noticed between allocation of money by the centre and utilization by the  
states.

In this respect, the Blue Revolution programme is expected to play a significant role as it seeks to  
improve training and capacity building of fishers and fish-farmers, encourage species  
diversification and proper fish health management, fortify the country’s scientific research and  
strengthen credit facilities. The key aspects that the scheme focusses on include sustainable fish  
farming, enhanced output through better coverage, addition of value-added products and species’  
diversification.

In India, traditional boats/ vessels have been used by fishers, which cannot operate beyond near-  
shore waters. This results in over-fishing in coastal waters, and under-fishing in deep-sea where  
high value fishes like tuna are found. Hence, there is a need to achieve a suitable balance.  
Acknowledging this, the Blue Revolution scheme aims to strengthen infrastructure including  
motorization of traditional craft, establishment of fishing harbours, establishment of hatcheries,  
and solar power support for aquaculture. The scheme also gives due importance to sustainability,  
thus, it steers away from introducing large scale industrial farming and instead focusses on  
enhancing productivity, better feed quality and diversification of species. The practice of setting  
up re-circulatory aquaculture system is likely to further boost sustainable fish farming.

The status of some of the important indicators that have been a focus of the Blue Revolution  
schemes have been analysed below^321.

As can be seen that the fisheries sector has achieved a consistent growth over last few years.  
There has been significant boost in production (nearly 25%) of inland fisheries in only two years,  
which shows the shift in focus from marine to inland fisheries development. In addition, there  
has been a significant increase in marketing of fresh and frozen fish. The curing of fish also  
increased significantly during this duration. In addition, numbers on fish seed production also  
show a tremendous growth of nearly 25% during the period of analysis.

The development of fisheries infrastructure and processing has also boosted the exports which  
have grown by nearly 50% between 2015-16 and 2017-18. While the numbers show a significant  
improvement in these areas, the welfare components including the fishermen provided with  
housing, insurance and relief declined significantly, this marks a shift in orientation of the scheme  
towards infrastructure development and improvement in production/ productivity.
