**Addendum to Operational Guidelines (OG) of AMI sub-scheme of ISAM**

Please refer to our circular No. 283/DoR\-68/2018-19 dated 26 November 2018 issuing the Operational Guidelines of AMI, sub scheme of ISAM. In this connection, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare, GoI vide their letter Ref.No. F.No.M-11011/06/ Revised Operational Guidelines / AMI-2023 / 148 dated 27th October 2023 (copy enclosed) have issued the Addendum to the Operational Guidelines of the scheme. The same is enclosed herewith along with the (i) Revised Advance Subsidy Claim Form, (ii) Revised Final Subsidy Claim Form, (iii) Inspection Report of the Branch Manager, Financial Institution (FI) and (iv) Utilization Certificate to be submitted by the FI. The revised instructions will be effective from 1st January 2024\.

2. As you are aware NABARD has been bringing transparency and efficiency in dispensing of subsidy, ENSURE portal is an important development in this direction. As the scheme for creating warehouse infrastructure has been in vogue for more than two decades and Fis have gained sufficient experience in implementing the scheme, it has been decided to fully digitalize the submission and scrutiny of applications. Fis will therefore not be required to submit hard copies of the documents. They will be henceforth required to upload a declaration at the time of submitting the advance and final subsidy claims with details of the project on their letter head signed by Competent Authority (not less than the rank of AGM). The formats of the same are enclosed.

3. **For operational/technical reasons, all pending advance subsidy applications in the ENSURE portal would be pushed back and a window of**

   **30 days would be given for banks to resubmit the applications** in the

   **modified system.**
