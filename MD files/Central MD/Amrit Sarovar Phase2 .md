    1. Water is one of the most vital natural resources, essential for sustaining life and supporting ecosystems. Despite covering two-thirds of the Earth's surface, only 2-3% of available water is usable, leading to a growing global water crisis. India, along with many other countries, is grappling with severe water scarcity, driven by factors such as climate change, over-extraction and pollution. Recognizing the urgency of this issue, the Hon’ble Prime Minister launched Mission Amrit Sarovar in April 2022, with the ambitious goal of constructing or rejuvenating 75 Amrit Sarovars (ponds) in each district with a total of 50,000 *sarovars* across the country. This initiative, implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), has been a resounding success, with states and Union Territories (UTs) reporting the completion of over 68,000 *sarovars* by August 2024\.

    2. In 44th PRAGATI meeting chaired by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 28.08.2024, held via video conference with Chief Secretaries of various States/UTs and Secretaries of various Ministries/Departments, the Prime Minister emphasized the need to continue work on the **Mission Amrit Sarovar** initiative. It was directed to ensure that the water catchment areas of these *sarovars* remain clean and that desilting of the water bodies be carried out as required, with active involvement from the local village communities.  
    3. Amrit Sarovars have proven instrumental in increasing both surface and underground water availability, serving as a sustainable solution to water scarcity. These ponds not only address immediate water needs but also symbolize a broader commitment to creating long- term, productive assets that benefit both the communities and the environment. As part of the *Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav*, commemorating 75 years of India’s independence, the development of these *sarovars* is a testament to constructive actions dedicated to the nation’s future.

       2.1.  The objective of Mission Amrit Sarovar is to facilitate the construction and rejuvenation of ponds in every rural district across the country. Each Amrit Sarovar situated in the plains is envisioned to have a pondage area of at least 1 acre (approximately 0.4 hectares) with a water holding capacity of around 10,000 cubic meters. For hilly and coastal areas of States and UTs, the structures shall be of at least 0.25 acres with water holding capacity of not less than 2,500 cubic meters. Through this initiative, the Mission aims to enhance water

       conservation and create sustainable water sources in every district, contributing to the overall community well-being and ecological balance.

       3.1. Each rural district of all States and Union Territories (except Delhi, Chandigarh and Lakshadweep) is mandated to construct or rejuvenate as many water bodies that can be identified as per the criteria given above.

    1. Important timelines for Mission Amrit Sarovar:

       1. Commencement of Amrit Sarovar works: 1st November 2024

       5.1.  The Mission will continue to be run with a “Whole of Government” approach in all its aspects. Accordingly, a wide swath of Ministries/Departments and organizations would work together to accomplish the goals. The following Ministries and organizations have committed to participate in the Mission:

1. Ministry of Rural Development (Dept. of Rural Development/ Dept. of Land Resources)

2. Ministry of Jal Shakti (Dept. of Water Resources/ Dept. of Drinking Water & Sanitation)

3. Ministry of Culture

4. Ministry of Panchayati Raj

5. Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change

6. Ministry of Road Transport and Highways

7. Ministry of Railways(Railway Board)

8. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs

9. Ministry of Defence

10. Ministry of Information & Broadcasting

11. Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geo-informatics (BISAG-N)

  


    1. ## **Completed works of Amrit Sarovar Phase \-I**

       1. States and Union Territories are advised that any Amrit Sarovar completed during the Mission Amrit Sarovar (Phase I) shall not be considered for inclusion under the continuance phase of Mission Amrit Sarovar. This means that any sites that have already been marked completed (constructed or rejuvenated) in the first phase should not be re- selected.

       2. The completed *sarovars* with minor or major defects are to be rectified and re-inspected again using Inspection App.  
       3. In districts or blocks where the construction or rejuvenation of Amrit Sarovars has reached saturation with existing *sarovars*, the associated users’ groups should be strengthened and empowered to undertake livelihood activities that generate income and foster long-term sustainability with participation of SHGs formed under State Rural Livelihood Mission.

    2. ## **Ongoing works of Amrit Sarovar of Phase-I**

       1. Amrit Sarovar projects from Phase I that are still marked as ongoing should be re-evaluated for potential inclusion in Phase II. Once selected, these projects will be automatically carried forward and designated under Phase II of the Mission for the respective States/UTs on the Amrit Sarovar portal.  
       2. Similar to Phase I, all works under this Mission will be identified using the Amrit Sarovar Application.  
    3. To ensure effective resource allocation and avoid duplication of efforts, priority should be given to new or additional sites that have not been previously addressed. To ensure this, the Amrit Sarovar application includes a provision that prohibits the identification of new *sarovar* sites for construction or rejuvenation within a 500-meter radius of an existing completed and ongoing Amrit Sarovars.

    4. **Amrit Sarovar under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA:**

       1. Amrit Sarovar sites identified by the district on the Amrit Sarovar portal shall also be mapped with the MGNREGA workcode on NREGASoft.  
       2. The work shall be taken up following due procedure of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA guidelines. The implementation of works should be in accordance with the provisions under Mahatma Gandhi NREG Act i.e. planning and prioritization by the Gram Sabha at

       the Gram Panchayat level, inclusion in Gram Sabha approved shelf of works, approvals (technical and administrative) and implementation.

       3. Under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, Amrit Sarovars to be taken up under the following 4 permissible works :

          1. Construction of Community Water Harvesting Ponds

          2. Construction of Fisheries Ponds for Community

          3. Renovation of Fisheries Ponds for Community

          4. Renovation of Community Ponds for Community

    5. **Site Selection and Approval:**

       1. Similar to the first phase, to enhance the effectiveness and credibility of Mission Amrit Sarovar, and to ensure optimal benefits from the Amrit Sarovar, it is essential to incorporate the latest and most relevant technologies throughout the project lifecycle, i.e. from site selection till its completion. This includes the use of advanced remote sensing and geospatial technologies.

       2. “Mission Amrit Sarovar” Portal developed by Bhaskaracharya National Institute of Space Application and Geomatics-National (BISAG-N) is to be utilised to generate a list of potential sites, monitor progress and upload media.  
       3. A list of potential sites (in addition to existing completed Amrit Sarovars) will be generated by BISAG-N for every district based on:

          1. **New sites:** availability of wastelands and rainwater; topography; Soil (depth/ type); geology. In particular, following factors should be considered:

             1) Availability of Land (Wasteland)

             2) Availability of Rain Water through drainage

             3) Topography- depression, low lying area (preferable)

             4) Soil depth- Deep

             5) Soil type- Neither alkaline, saline, nor acidic

             6) Geology–No lineament/fault etc. at the site

          2. **Rejuvenation:** Realizable additional capacity.

          3. ## The **distance from residential areas and infrastructural works**.

       4. The district may also receive suggestions from public representatives, PRIs, members of the public, civil society organisations (CSOs), academic institutions and research bodies etc. on potential sites. The Amrit Sarovar portal can be used to generate technical

       parameters for each suggested site. Based on this exercise, a list of potential sites should be generated. While finalising the sites, the district may focus on water-stressed blocks.

       5. Each site would be visited by joint teams of both technical and administrative officials to examine its feasibility. These teams should be constituted by the district administration drawing upon human resources from all relevant agencies in order to complete it in the shortest possible time. The teams would hold discussions with all relevant stakeholders including downstream farmers, and potential users and also visit the catchment area, drainage channels etc. Apart from commenting upon the feasibility of sites, the teams would also report on other associated actions needed such as removal of encroachments, treatment of greywater, disputes etc. Based on this exercise, the potential sites would be ranked on objective parameters and should be prioritized in selection accordingly. The list may be vetted, if required, by the concerned officials of the relevant departments of the districts.

       6. The sites of the *Sarovars* located in the villages of freedom fighters and post- independence martyrs should be prioritized.  
       7. State Government should undertake construction/rejuvenation of Amrit Sarovar on Government/ Community lands (other than private lands) in convergence mode with various schemes of Central Government as well as State Governments.  
       8. Amrit Sarovar in the forest areas may be constructed only after due clearance from the concerned forest department. Amrit Sarovars in forest areas, may be constructed by the forest department themselves. If construction by the forest department is not feasible, then a No Objection Certificate (NOC) should be provided to the implementing agency, which may be entrusted with the work.  
       9. The districts should draw up an **Action Plan** for Mission Amrit Sarovar, which should include details of sites for Amrit Sarovars, sources of funding, executing agencies, agencies/supervisors responsible for monitoring and documentation, timelines for activities, methods for citizen mobilisation and celebration of the development of Amrit Sarovars etc.  
       10. **The selection of Amrit Sarovar sites will require approval from a special Gram Sabha**. Additionally, the Gram Sabha will appoint a *Panchayat Partinidhi* (PP) who will be responsible for supervising the development of the Amrit Sarovar on its behalf.

    6. ## **Activities to be undertaken at the Sarovar Sites**

       1. Special care should be taken to ensure proper treatment of the bund around the structure by ensuring layer-wise compaction, including through the use of machinery (excluding works taken up under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), turfing and appropriate slope thereof.  
       2. In the case of rejuvenation of existing water bodies, there are detailed guidelines that

       have been issued by the National Water Mission. Rejuvenation may include cleaning/desilting, removal of encroachments, clearing the channels for water flow, treatment of catchment area and improving water quality if required.

       3. ***Common Signage (Board and Logo):***To mark the occasion, an information board should also be put up at every Amrit Sarovar, displaying all the information related to the work available to the public. The information board will have a common signage (board) of standard size ( 5 feet height, 4 feet width) and a common logo, the design of the board and logo is attached as **Annexure *A***.  
       4. The details of contributions/donations received (labour/ materials/ machine) towards the Amrit Sarovar should be listed on a separate display board installed near the Citizen Information Board/Display board.

    7. ## **State/District Level Committee:**

       1. For the effective implementation & coordination of the Mission at the ground level, committees will be formed at the State level under the chairpersonship of the Chief Secretary and district level under the chairpersonship of the District Magistrate (DM)/ District Collector (DC) respectively including all the stakeholders involved as its members.  
       2. The committees shall ensure vertical and horizontal coordination and problem resolution and also monitor the progress of the Mission from time to time.

    8. ## **Technical aspects:**

       States/UTs to consider the following technical aspects while planning and implementing the Mission Amrit Sarovar –

       1. **Catchment demarcation:** The catchment of the Sarovar should be demarcated and the

       \- discharge of runoff water (quantity of water into the *Sarovar*) should be calculated and accordingly the structures of the Amrit Sarovar should be designed.

       2. **Catchment treatment:** Treatment of the catchment should be done as per the in situ requirement and should be included in the Detailed Project Report (Estimate). Different sites require different kinds of treatment measures as per the soil, rainfall, topography, location, etc. graded bunds, guide bunds, loose boulder structures, open inlets, stone bunds, hedges etc should be provided in the catchment along with plantation. Catchment treatment of the Amrit Sarovar should be taken up as per the ridge-to-valley approach.  
       3. **Inlet channels**: The inlet channels in the catchment areas should be treated according to the ground condition. There should not be scouring of the base, formation of gullies and

       breaches in the channels.

       4. **Silt Trap:** The provision of a silt trap should be made in desirable intervals for the sedimentation of silt from the discharge runoff. This should be provided wherever sources of water enter the Amrit Sarovar.

       5. **Calculation Sheet**: A calculation sheet should be provided in the estimate to know the base, stripping area, fine dressing & grass turfing area and the stone pitching area by chainage calculation of the entire embankment of the Amrit Sarovar.  
       6. **Compaction of Soil**: Layer-wise compaction of the soil of subgrade (ramming & rolling) should be done and the breaking of clods with a size not more than 5-7 centimetres. Provision should be made in the estimate for compaction of soil.  
       7. **Masonry Structures:** The masonry structures such as masonry inlet, outlet(surplus), sluice etc should be provided as per the specification calculated by design. The level of all the structures should also be checked with reference to a benchmark.  
       8. **Berm:** Berms should be provided along the embankment for better stability to the embankment from wave action erosion and breaches.  
       9. **Slope of the embankment:** The upstream and downstream slope should be provided sufficiently so that the phreatic line/seepage line should fall within the embankment (bund) and should be protected by grass turfing or any other means for stability of the structure.

    1. *Jan Bhagidaari* (People’s Participation) is key to the entire initiative, as it is meant to evoke the collective spirit of the community.

    2. People’s participation is required at all levels of execution of Mission Amrit Sarovar:

       1. The foundation stone for each Amrit Sarovar will be laid by a freedom fighter or a member of their family, a family member of a post-independence martyr, or a local Padma awardee. If none of these individuals are available, the eldest citizen of the respective local Gram Panchayat should be engaged to perform the ceremony.

       2. Community members are encouraged to participate in the development of Amrit Sarovar 

        by donating construction materials, and benches, and through *Shram Daan* (volunteer 

        labour). Support can also be sought via crowdfunding and CSR contributions. If the 

        village community wishes to undertake beautification efforts at the *Sarovar* site, they 

        should mobilize necessary donations to fund these enhancements. 

       3. On the occasion of every Republic Day (26th January) and Independence Day (15th August) Tricolor is to be hoisted at Amrit Sarovar sites, by the freedom fighter or his/her family members, by the family member of a post-independence martyr or a local Padma Awardee. If none of these individuals are available, the eldest citizen of the respective local Gram Panchayat should be engaged in flag hoisting.

       4. The development of Amrit Sarovar will be celebrated through various associated events such as foundation stone laying, plantation, flag hoisting on Republic Day \&Independence Day, and the dedication of the *Sarovar* to the community. These events should actively involve elected representatives, PRI representatives, Self Help Groups (SHGs), youth, and school children. Special recognition will be given to a freedom fighter or their family member, a family member of a post-independence martyr, or the eldest citizen of the local Panchayat, who will be honoured with a place of pride at all such events.

       5. ## **Mapping of Users’ Group:**

          1. Effective maintenance and sustainability of Amrit Sarovars requires a formation and 

 clear mapping of users’ groups associated with each *sarovar* largely drawn from 

 members of SHGs. 

2. Possible users of such water structures, including for irrigation, fisheries, duckery, cultivation of water chestnut, animal husbandry etc., should be identified for taking up livelihood generation activities. These activities will be managed by mapped user groups, each linked to their respective Amrit Sarovar.

   3. Proper identification and coordination of these user groups are essential for the optimal use and upkeep of the *sarovars.*  
      4. This group should be engaged with the project from conceptualization till its completion 

       and later use, with full involvement in all stages of Amrit Sarovar's development— 

       feasibility assessment, execution, utilization, maintenance and sustainability. 

         5. The user group will also be responsible for the ongoing use and maintenance of the Amrit Sarovar including the plantation activities.  
         6. The removal of silt from the catchment area should be done by the users’ groups voluntarily after every monsoon season.

      6. **Community Hubs:** Amrit Sarovar sites are to be developed as vibrant Community Hubs to promote unity and a sense of belonging. These sites should serve as focal points for a variety of activities, including national festivals, social initiatives such as *Swachchata* Rallies and *Jal Shapath* (water conservation pledges), school events, religious celebrations, morning walks, yoga sessions, school games, and other recreational

      activities. By hosting these diverse activities, Amrit Sarovars will enhance community engagement and foster a stronger, more connected community.

      7. ## **Role of Deendayal Antyodaya Yojna-National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY- NRLM) and State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLM):**

         1. The DAY-NRLM/SRLM will play a key role in ensuring the success of income-generating activities undertaken by User Groups in connection with the Amrit Sarovar since they comprise largely of members drawn from SHGs. Their focus shall be on maximizing the economic output from livelihood activities, thereby enhancing community income and sustainability.

         2. DAY-NRLM/SRLM, through their existing schemes and projects, will provide comprehensive hand-holding support to the User Groups to ensure entrepreneurial growth. This support will span the entire process of income generation—beginning with capacity building and training, to helping establish market linkages for selling products and ensuring access to necessary resources. The objective is to ensure end-to-end assistance, enabling User Groups to develop their businesses and generate steady, sustainable income streams.  
         3. Moreover, DAY-NRLM/SRLM shall coordinate with other government departments and programs to amplify the impact of these efforts. They will facilitate access to additional resources, infrastructure, and financial incentives, particularly for Self-Help Groups (SHGs), to boost productivity and profitability. By aligning with various rural development schemes, DAY-NRLM/SRLM will help User Groups scale up their operations, tap into new markets, and foster greater economic resilience.

   1. Railways, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and state PWDs may also support the District Authorities in desilting/excavation of earth of identified water bodies or construction of new water bodies at suitable sites in the vicinity of railway lines and national/state highways if such water bodies or sites meet the criterion for construction of Amrit Sarovar and such earth can be used for their projects/activities productively.

   2. The District Authorities may identify possible sites for the creation of new water bodies, near the work sites of the agencies and indicate such sites to the local representatives of Railways, NHAI, state PWDs, etc. for excavation & use of excavated material in railway embankment and in road works, wherever quality of earth is found suitable for rail and

      road construction. District authorities would facilitate in providing requisite permits etc in this regard.

   3. The regional/state authorities of the above shall coordinate with the State Nodal Officer of the Mission Amrit Sarovar to facilitate these linkages.

   4. **Use of soil and silt excavated during the process of development of Amrit Sarovar in Central Infrastructure Projects:**

      1. Construction of Amrit Sarovar provides a huge amount of silt and soil which can be utilized for infrastructure development works especially the railways and roadways projects.  
      2. Gram Panchayat will decide on a fair disposal of silt coming out of this Amrit Sarovar construction/renovation.  
      3. Both the Railways Board and Ministry of Road Transport & Highways shall work in close coordination with district administration for the carriage of soil from Amrit Sarovar to their embankment sites.  
      4. The borrow areas declared for railway and highway projects may also be converted into Amrit Sarovar.

      7. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) may coordinate with Railways and Highways for carriage of excess soil from Amrit Sarovar and may issue advisory to the concerned agencies to coordinate with Railways and Highways for utilization of the excess soil excavated from Amrit Sarovar and also from pipeline works. Also, share a list of identified sites to Railway and NHAI for utilization of the excess soil excavated from Amrit Sarovar. They could also utilize the soil from Amrit Sarovar being undertaken in rural areas for their infrastructure projects.  
      8. The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) may issue directives in this regard for projects being taken up by the State PWDS from the Central Road Infrastructure Fund (CRIF). MoRTH may use advisory to State PWDs regarding utilizing excess soil from Amrit Sarovar for their projects.  
      9. **Waiver of Royalty:** Regarding the incentivization of the Railways and the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways for facilitating the use of surplus soil from Amrit Sarovar projects, the Government of Maharashtra issued an order dated 29th November 2017, the

      model order by Govt. of Maharashtra, **stipulates that minor minerals (soil) can be provided free of cost for National Highway projects, and it waives the requirement for a transport license from the Revenue Department**, which may be referred by other States/UTs for its adoption for exemption of soil/earth generated from the development of Amrit Sarovar and waiver of royalty if the same is utilized for railway, highway and other infrastructure projects. A copy of the order is attached at **Annexure B**. It would facilitate ease of movement of surplus soil and earth from Amrit Sarovar to their construction sites.

    All Amrit Sarovars constructed/rejuvenated will be geo-tagged at three different stages i.e. before the construction, during the construction and after the completion of asset creation using the GeoMGNREGA app of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.

    7. ## **Use of Supervision Tools of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS:**

       Amrit Sarovar will be utilising various supervision tools thatare already being utilised for monitoring under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.

1. **National Mobile Monitoring System (NMMS)**: Real-time attendance of workers at the worksite shall be taken twice a day through National Mobile Monitoring System.

2. **Area Officer App**: Area officer App shall be utilised by the collector,Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Zila Parishad (ZP), and Block Development Officer (BDO) for inspection and monitoring of the gram Panchayat along with Amrit Sarovar worksite.  
3. **Monitoring by Drone**: Drone technology may be utilized to monitor the progress of Amrit Sarovar worksites following the SOP issued by Ministry of Rural Development accessed from NREGASoft- https://nregaplus.nic.in/netnrega/writereaddata/Circulars/24742- MGNREGA\_SOP\_DRONE\_Bilingual(E\&H)\_Final\_29.11.2023.pdf

   1. To ensure the quality of Amrit Sarovar, a total of 25 indicators are identified – attached at **Annexure C**. Out of these 25 indicators, 9 critical indicators have been identified, which significantly impact the sustainability of a *Sarovar* over time. These include pondage area, water holding capacity, presence of berm, bund treatment, silt trap, grass turf/lining, catchment area treatment, and inlet/outlet.

   2. If a *sarovar* complies with all 9 indicators, it is to be classified as an ideal Amrit Sarovar. However, if it fails to comply with any of the 7 indicators \- pondage area, water holding capacity, berm, bund treatment, grass turf/lining, silt trap and catchment area treatment \- it is considered an Amrit Sarovar with **major defects**. Similarly, compliance with these parameters but non-compliance with any of the remaining 2 indicators, namely treatment of catchment area and inlet/outlet, classifies the *sarovar* as an Amrit Sarovar with **minor defects**.  
   3. States/UTs to take corrective action for *sarovars* with minor and major defects to mark the

      *sarovar* as **completed**.

   1. After the completion of construction/rejuvenation, Amrit Sarovar is flagged as ‘Sarovar Ready for inspection’. To ensure the quality of construction/rejuvenation of Amrit Sarovar

      and mark the Sarovar from ‘Sarovar Ready for inspection’ to ‘Completed’ inspection of

      *sarovars* using the Amrit Sarovar Inspection App is a mandatory step.

   2. The latest version of Amrit Sarovar Inspection App available in Google Play store is to be used for inspecting the quality of Amrit Sarovar.  
   3. The Amrit Sarovar Inspection Mobile App enables the inspection team to examine Amrit Sarovar over 25 parameters (checklist for inspection) including its identification, construction, usage, maintenance and community aspects along with 1-3 photographs.  
   4. District level teams are to inspect all the Amrit Sarovars in the district, and the report submitted by District level teams is further approved or rejected by the State Level Team depending on the status. If the quality of any Amrit Sarovars is not at par i.e. if found with minor or major defects then it is to be re-inspected again after corrective action and the same is to be updated in the portal.

   5. Further, central teams and state teams shall conduct surprise inspections and sample checks over and above the inspections conducted by the district level teams.

   1. ## **Republic Day/ Independence Day (26th January/ 15th August)**:

      1. Independence Day to be celebrated at Amrit Sarovar sites by engaging local stakeholders, including schools, community groups and government officials, to ensure active participation and a meaningful celebration. On this occasion activities like flag hoisting, *Tiranga Yatra*, cultural programme, cleanliness drive and interactive sessions are to be organized. It is to be ensured that photographs of all activities are uploaded on the Mission Amrit Sarovar portal using the mobile application.

   2. ## **World Environment Day (5th June)**:

      1. States/UTs are to organise tree plantation drives, clean-up activities and awareness campaigns about the importance of water conservation and biodiversity at all Amrit Sarovar sites on World Environment Day (WED) and upload the photographs of the activities at the portal using Amrit Sarovar Mobile Application.

   3. ## **International Yoga Day (21st June)**:

      1. States/UTs are to organise yoga sessions at the Amrit Sarovar Sites on International Yoga Day by engaging local community, school children and villagers and upload pictures of Yoga Day activities organised at Amrit Sarovar sites.

   4. ## **World Water Day (22nd March)**

      1. States/UTs are to organise clean-up activities and awareness campaigns about the

      importance of water conservation at all Amrit Sarovar sites on World Water Day.

   5. ## **Plantation:**

      1. Plantation of suitable seedlings should be taken up stage-wise in the catchment area and toe of downstream of the embankment. Horticulture plants, bamboo plants and any other plants as per the suitability along with neem (*Azadirachta indica*), peepal (*Ficus*

      *religiosa*), and banyan (*Ficus benghalensis*) and native plants should be planted around the Amrit Sarovar. There should be more green cover in the Amrit Sarovar area, which will be helpful in improving the soil moisture condition and limiting soil loss.

      2. A commemorative plantation of trees should be conducted at each Amrit Sarovar work site on 15th August (Independence Day) and 5th June (World Environment Day) every year. This event should be led by a freedom fighter or a member of their family, a family member of a post-independence martyr, or a local Padma awardee. If no such individuals are available, the eldest citizen of the respective local Gram Panchayat should be invited to lead the plantation.

      In order to effectively assess the impact of the construction or rejuvenation of Amrit Sarovars within a Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Level Officers (PLOs) are required to capture and document key parameters that reflect the changes brought about by these initiatives. These parameters will help quantify the environmental, agricultural, and hydrological benefits achieved through the Mission Amrit Sarovar.

   1. ## **Enhancement in Plantation and Green Coverage:**

      PLOs must measure the increase in green cover resulting from the plantation of various plants and saplings around the Amrit Sarovars. The number of saplings planted, their growth, and the overall increase in the area under plantation should be recorded. This data will help assess the contribution of the Sarovar to improving biodiversity and enhancing local ecosystems.

   2. ## **Carbon Sequestration over time :**

      The increase in vegetation around the Amrit Sarovars will contribute to carbon sequestration and reduce the carbon footprint of the area in the long term.

      *Key Metrics to Capture for Plantation and Carbon Sequestration:*

      * Number of saplings/plants planted

      * Species of trees/plants

   3. ## **Increase in Water Holding Capacity:**

      The construction or rejuvenation of Amrit Sarovars is expected to enhance the water holding capacity in the Gram Panchayat. PLOs must measure the overall increase in water storage capacity due to these interventions. This is a crucial factor in improving water availability for various uses, including irrigation and domestic chores.

      *Key Metrics to Capture:*

      * Pre-construction water holding capacity (in cubic meters)

      * Post-construction water holding capacity (in cubic meters)

      * Percentage increase in water storage

      * Period of availability of water (perennial /seasonal) By (Capturing Length, Breadth and Depth of *sarovar)*

   4. ## **Enhancement of Irrigation Potential:**

      With the availability of additional water from Amrit Sarovars, the irrigation potential of the area is likely to improve. PLOs must calculate and capture the expansion in irrigated land area as a result of this additional water supply. This data will reflect the impact of the *sarovar* on agricultural productivity in the village.

      Key Metrics to Capture:

      * Area of land irrigated during Kharif crop before and after *sarovar* construction

      * Area of land irrigated during Rabi crop before and after *sarovar* construction

   5. ## **Groundwater Recharge:**

      The rejuvenation or construction of Amrit Sarovars contributes to the natural recharge of groundwater. PLOs must measure and record the increase in groundwater levels or recharge rates. This will help determine the effectiveness of the *sarovars* in improving groundwater availability for domestic and agricultural use.

      Key Metrics to Capture:

      * Pre and post-construction groundwater levels (in meters) in nearby two-three open wells with location (latitude and longitude).

      * Number of wells/borewells benefiting from the recharge.

   6. ## **Income generation activities:**

      This key parameter focuses on the capacity of user groups to generate income through the sustainable use and management of *sarovar*. It highlights how *sarovar* serves as a livelihood source, empowering communities and driving local economic growth.

      Key Metrics to Capture:

      * Total number of members in the user group

      * Livelihood activities adopted/revenue stream generated through *sarovar* usage

      * Number of households benefitting directly from Amrit Sarovar through income enhancement opportunities.

      * Average increase in income generated per user group through *sarovar* activities.

      All the above parameters must be captured through the Mobile Application. PLOs are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data, which will be maintained and monitored in the Management Information System (MIS). This data will serve as a key reference for assessing the long-term impact of the Mission Amrit Sarovar initiative. The detailed SoP on the guidelines to capture data is attached as **Annexure D**.

   1.

   2. Public contribution (crowdfunding/Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)) for the work is also permitted.

   3. Mahatma Gandhi NREGS funds should not be used for the beautification of works.

   1. Districts and states should thoroughly document the entire initiative, capturing all stages of Amrit Sarovar’s development, including community mobilization, citizen donations, and other unique features. This documentation should be prepared in both video and written formats, covering aspects such as site selection, foundation laying, implementation stages, community participation, financial details, convergence efforts, water utilization (irrigation, aquaculture), cost-benefit analysis, and other relevant aspects of the Amrit Sarovar project. States/UTs must ensure comprehensive coverage of these elements in the documentation process.  
   2. Production of short films by the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting.

   3. A separate national-level detailed report will be documented on Mission Amrit Sarovar.

   4. Panchayat Level Officer (PLO) would also be responsible for uploading at least 3 videos of the site viz. before commencement, during development and on completion and upload any other media documenting the development of Amrit Sarovars.  
   5. Ministries, states or districts may also post progress, stories etc. on Social Media concurrently.  
   6. **Information, Education and Communication (IEC) Nodal Officer for Mission Amrit Sarovar:** States/UTs to nominate an IEC Nodal Officer specifically for Mission Amrit Sarovar. The IEC Nodal Officer will be responsible for ensuring that high-quality photographs and other relevant visual documentation are regularly captured and uploaded to the Mission Amrit Sarovar portal. This role is crucial for maintaining a comprehensive and visually engaging record of the project’s progress, helping to highlight the initiative's impact and success across different regions for the information of the general public.

     *Note: Data to be captured from open wells/borewells within 1000 meters radius of the sarovar*

   ## **Measurement Guidelines :**

1. In the case of more than one well around the Amrit Sarovar, the well number and well name should be mentioned along with the well ID. For well ID, the English alphabet should be added after the Amrit Sarovar ID. For example, if Amrit Sarovar id is 12345 the four identified wells around Amrit Sarovar would be as follows:

   1. 12345-A

   2. 12345-B

   3. 12345-C

   4. 12345-D

2. Ensure that no water has been extracted from the well in the past 10 to 12 hours before measurement. If extraction has occurred, wait 10 to 12 hours before taking the measurement.

3. All groundwater levels should be measured from the ground surface.  
4. Record the depth to water level consistently from the same measuring point each time( pre & post completion of Amrit Sarovar).

5. Measure the diameter of the well in meter  
6. When measuring from the top of the well parapet, calculate the actual groundwater level as follows:

   Actual groundwater level (m)

   \= (equal to)

   Groundwater level from the top of the parapet (m)

   − (minus / subtract)

   Length of the parapet outside the ground surface (m)

7. Unit of measurement should be **Meter**  
8. Enter the actual groundwater level accurately

9. It is advisable to capture the groundwater level data from all the identified open wells around the Amrit Sarovar on the same day.  
10. In case the well is dry (either pre or post construction), measure from the bottom of the well to the ground level of the well, i.e., the complete depth of the well in meters.

11. Location (Latitude and Longitude) of the well should be captured using the NoteCam mobile app available on the Google play store. While capturing the location, ensure that the accuracy of the location is within 10 meters.  
12. The water level should be measured in a simple way: first gently lower the measuring tape or marked rope tied with heavy metal weight or stone into the well, and record the depth from the reference point.  
13. For critical measurements, repeat the process two to three times and average the readings to improve accuracy.  
14. Once the water level is detected, record the depth of the water table.  
15. A picture of the well should be captured using the **NoteCam mobile app**

16. The location should be uploaded to the Amrit Sarovar dashboard.

    **Depth to Water level (mbgl) \= Depth of water level from MP	Height of Parapet (m)**

    4. **Income generation activities**

    Data to be captured in three stages:

1. **During** the construction/rejuvenation of *sarovar* –

   * Total number of members in the user group

   * Livelihood activities adopted/ Revenue stream generated through *sarovar* usage

   * Number of households benefitting directly from Amrit Sarovar through income enhancement opportunities.  
   * Average income generated by User group owing to *sarovar* activities

   5. **Enhancement in Plantation and Green Coverage** and

   6. **Carbon Sequestration over time**

   Data to be captured in the following stages:

1. ## **During the 1st Year of Plantation**

   * Event of plantation (part of *sarovar*/World Environment Day/Independence Day/ Monsoon)

   * Number of saplings/plants planted under Amrit Sarovar

   * Species of trees/plants

   * Month and year of plantation
