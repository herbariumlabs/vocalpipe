**Project on Model Organic Cluster Demonstration and Model Organic Farm under PKVY scheme.**

Considering the existing potential of organic farming and the future demand for organic proauce, the Government is promoting organic farming across the country. The Paramparagat Krishi

### Vikas Yojana (PKVY) is a comprehensive scheme under National Mission of Sustainable

Agriculture (NMSA) to promote organic farming through a cluster approach along with Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) of certification. This centrally sponsored scheme is being implemented by the states government on farmers’ field. This scheme was initiated for implementation in the year 2015-16 but State Governments have not achieved the assigned target due to lack of infrastructure support and knowhow about the scheme. On the other hand the availability of expert resourceful agencies have not been utilized due to policy constrains where these agencies can support in a major way in the implementation of PKVY Scheme. Keeping in view it is proposed to involve/invite these agencies in major role to provide Model Organic Cluster Demonstration and Model Organic Farm. At present, under this scheme there is no direct involvement of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), Central Agricultural Universities (CAUs), Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), which have good knowledge in the field of organic farming and have availability of large number of field farms & infrastructure. The existing huge potential of these organizations in the form of qualified Human Resources and large infrastructure including farms can be put to use for demonstration of organic farming technologies. To boost the organic farming across the country, there is a need to implement **Model Organic Cluster demonstration and model**

**organic farms** under the PKVY scheme through these institutions. National Advisory Committee

### (NAC) has decided the inclusion of Model Organic Clusters / Farms under the guidelines of The

Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) in the meeting dated 28.12.2016.
