**0 	4.3.3.Two** months training programme aims at transforming persons qualified in the field of agriculture and allied sectors into agri\-entrepreneurs. It is an intensive

capacity building effort by the NTI faculty in association with locally available experts and successful agri-entrepreneurs. The training programme is divided into two categories of activities:

1. 	Exposing the trainees into.,potential agri\-ventures in their area and providing additional subject matter training to refresh their knowledge and skills. Besides motivation, training will also concentrate on building communication skills, record maintenance, schemes/ programmes from where financial assistance is available etc. For instance, trainees interested in setting up Soil Testing Laboratories, Small Scale Bio-inputs Preparation Units, Custom Hiring of Machineries will be impartec:f requisite skills and knowledge. The basic idea is to customize the training modules based individual and collective needs of the entire group while adhering to the prescribed syllabi which is available at [www.agriclinics.net/scheme\-training.htm.](http://www.agriclinics.net/scheme-training.htm)

   2. 	Facilitate the trainees to choose a venture and to prepare DPR based on market survey, hands on experience with the support of experienced bankers. Detailed interactions should be arr. ged with stakeholders such as farmers, bankers, department officials, input dealers, NGOs working in the area. Identification and analysis of farmers' problems and provision solutions through extension and business advisories are focused upon. Assessing technical feasibility and financial viability of ventures, hands\-on interface with the successful entrepreneurs and DPR preparation with assistance by experienced bankers as resource persons are the other crucial parts of this activity.  
      4. **MANAGE** will coordinate scheduling of training in each NTI by sanctioning one or more batches simultaneously depending on the availability of selected candidates, infrastructure and logistic facilities.  
      5. The threshold percentage for success rate for awarding another course to the same NTI shall be minimum 50% every year Based on documentation prescribed for assessing the success rate, verification shall be carried out by any two members of the team menti- ned at para 4.1.1 above (nominees of sufficiently senior levels will also be permissible for this purpose) based on the record available in NTL This team of two or more members shall also consider periodic & surprise inspection reports while recommending sanction of another course.

4. **Admission** of Expenditure: The utilizations certificate shall be admitted by MANAGE as per the cost norms of ACABC or actual expenditure claimed whichever is less. NTis must maintain records related to actual number of candidates who are not staying in the training institute/hostel. Such candidates have to be considered as Day- Scholars and to be reported to MANAGE as per Annexure VII. Any deviation in the admission of the expenditure against the amount claimed in the Utilization Certificate will be informed to NTI by MANAGE. Any unspent or un\-admitted amount shall be returned by NTI within a fortnight from receipt of the communication in this regard from MANAGE. MANAGE shall withhold the release of further funds to NTls which do not adhere to the above guidelines, besides recovering"the excess from Bank Guarantee.

   5. **Release of Handholding Fund:**

      1. 	Half of the handholding amount i.e. Rs. 2,500/- per trained candidate shall be released to the NTI on receipt of list of projects submitted to bank (for candidates who intend to establish the venture with bank fin.ance) along with proof of submission. NTis must submit Utilizations Certificate for this amount within a year from the date of completion of respective training programmes as per  the  format  available  at  http://  [www.agriclinics.net](http://www.agriclinics.net/)  /guideHnes

         /handholdinguc-allcategories.pdf

         2. 	Remaining 50% of the handholding amount i.e. Rs. 2,500/- per established candidate shall be released to NTI on receipt of proof for Agri-Venture establishment.

In case of self financed Agri-Ventures, NTis may claim full handholding amount on submission of proof for Agri-venture establishment.

      6. **Incentives to Candidates and NTis**

         1. 	NTis with cumulative and respective batch success rate of more than 50 percent are eligible to get an additional incentive of Rs. 2000/- per candidate for every candidate established after 50% success rate, reported in respective batch. NTis shall submit receipt to MANAGE for accounting purpose and Utilization Certificate is not needed for this amount.

         2. 	Every candidate who establishes his/her venture and submits proof to that effect is eligible to receive an incentive of Rs. 1000/-. This incentive amount may be electronically transferred to the candidate on verification by NTL

         **4,5.6.3.** As handholding and reporting the progress are continuous activities, MANAGE may release the handholding amount to NTis on bi-monthly basis.

...  
•

7. **Payment of bandholding charges to another NTI**

   1. Presently, the Training institutes where the candidates undergo training receive the handholding charges. For some reasons (e.g. distance, inactive NTls etc), the NTI which trains a particular candidate might not have been able to submit the DPR or successfully complete the handholding support leading to setting up of venture. While such handholding is to be provided for one year, a trained candidate may know whether the handholding is on the right track.  
      2. If a venture is not successfully established within one year and the candidate

         feels that this has happened due to the lack of appropriate handholding by NTI	**E)**

         that trained him, he may opt for subsequent handholding by a different NTL In such a case, full handholding amount of Rs. 5000/ \- (where even the first instalment would not have been disbursed due to non-submission of DPRs) or 2nd instalment of Rs. 2,500/- shall be paid to such another NTI, which will be considered for handholding charges only after the trained candidate expresses his willingness to get associated with such other NTI in writing to MANAGE. Besides this, the NTI which is willing to provide handholding to a candidate not trained by it has to convey its willingness to MANAGE in writing to provide handholding. Confirmation about setting up of a successful venture as a sequel to such handholding by another NTI will be reported i\_n the prescribed format. Tl1t: above steps wiU ensure non-duplication ot payment to more than one NTL Responsibility of handholding of candidates trained by NTls, which have been subsequently declared as inactive, may be given to willing/ active NTls in respective States.

      8. **Criteria for declaring Recognized NTI as Inactive NTI**

1. Not conducting any programme during the last one year

2. Cumulative Success rate below 35°to (except NTls in J\&K and NE States)

3. Not starting training within six months from the date of signing MOU

4. Not providing handholding activities as per guidelines

5. 	Default in submitting UCs for more than a year (to be declared inactive only after receiving UCs)

6. Violating the norms of MOU or these instructions.

   Any one of the criteria is sufficient to consider any NTI as inactive.

   6. **Certificates to successful ventures:	8**  
      Certificates are being issued to trainees by MANAGE after successful completion	•  
      of two month training. It has been decided that successfully established ventures	•  
      will a get a certificate recognizing that their enterprise is set up under the Scheme.	•  
      of State Agriculture University /lCAR institute as per the following procedure.	**C**

recommendation to MANAGE as above.

* Certificates consisting Can.didate's ID No. and venture details will be issued by MANAGE indicating the date on which verification was conducted.

  This certificate entitles the agri-preneurs to be recognized by the Development Departments in supplementing the efforts of public extension services. Proof of establishment of venture will be provided in the format given in Annexure VIII.

  7. **Refresher & Sensitization Training**

     1. 	About 500 selected agri-preneurs will undergo refresher training every year. This training of about 3-5 days duration may be conducted in specialized Institutions like SAUs/ ICAR Institutes /IIMs/lITs/CSIR Institutes /DST Institutes/ reputed Private/ Non- governmental Institutions. Detailed financial norms for refresher courses under ACABC Scheme are given at Annexure-LX.  
     2. NABARD will organize sensitization training/workshops to motivate the bankers across the country to provide credit to Agri-preneurs for establishing ventures. Budget of Rs. 25 lakh per year has been provided to NABARD for the purpose. NABARD will submit details of cost norms, numbers of courses, duration and officers to be trained. NABARD will necessarily inform MANAGE and DAC\&FW for participation of their representatives in such sensitization programmes.

  5. **CREDIT SUPPORT**

1. **Linkage with Credit**

   1. 	Assistance under the scheme would be purely credit linked and subject to sanction of the project by banks based on economic viability .and commercial considerations. The eligibleJiriancial institutions under the scheme are:  
1) Commercial Banks  ...

2) Regional Rural Banks

3) State Cooperative Banks

4) State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks		,-

5) Such other institutions eligible for refinance from NABARD.

   2. **Project Cost Ceiling**

      1. 	Ceiling of project cost for subsidy is Rs. 20 lakh for an individual project (25 lakh in case of extremely successful individual projects) and up to Rs. 100 lakh for a group project (Established by a group comprising at least 5 trained persons under the scheme). The bank may, nevertheless, subject to their wn satisfaction, finance groups formed by 2 or more trained persons under the scheme, with in the TFO ceiling Rs. 20 lakh per trained person and overall ceiling of Rs. 100 lakh, whichever is less for the purpose of subsidy. However, the actual credit sanctioned by the bank for a venture established under the scheme could be higher depending on the financial viability and technical feasibility. Thus, for instance, if an individual is granted a loan for TFO of Rs. 35 lakh, subsidy shall be reckoned only on TFO of Rs. 20 lakh.	•

2. To encourage exceptionally successful individual agri-preneurs, the project cost limit for subsidy purposes may be extended by Rs. 5 lakh in addition to the generally applicable project cost limit of Rs. 20 lakh for calculating subsidy. This will serve as an incentive to an agri\-preneur to expand his/her already established and successful venture. Format for considering such cases is given on the MANAGE website http:/ [/www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/](http://www.agriclinics.net/guidelines/) Annexure\-XVII.pdf "(Ventures which score minimum 75 marks as per the format will be considered exceptionally successful). Such cases are to be approved by the Empowered Steering Committee using the criteria given at Annexure X based on the recommendation of the Banker and ATMA official.  
   3. In order to provide extension services using web-enabled resources of DAC\&FW and other agencies, computer, printer and broadband connection should be an integral part of TFO.

      4. To attract more women candidates to the scheme parents/husbands/ in \-laws of the trained women candidate can be made co\-borrowers with the eligibility for subsidy.

      3. **Term Loan:**

         1. The term loan would be composite in nature and participating bank(s) would extend bank loan as per the TFO, which would include fixed capital cost and working capital for one operating cycle. Loan sanctioned will be the differential amount between TFO and margin money.

         2. Composite subsidy will be provided even for low capital investment cases as it is definitely possible that some agri-preneurs already have capital (e.g. a building) to start a venture, thereby requiring minimal capital investment. At least 10% value of the Total Financial Outlay of the project should be in capital form.  
         3. The repayment schedule will be drawn on the total amount of the loan (including subsidy) in such a way that the subsidy amount is adjusted after liquidation of net bank loan (excluding subsidy).

         4. Repayment period will depepd on the nature of activity and will vary between 5 to 10 years. The repayment period may include a maximum grace period of 2 years (to be decided by the financing bank as per needs of individual projects).

         5. 	Rate of interest on term loan shall be as per RBI guidelines and declared policy of the bank in this regard. Interest would be chargeable on borrower's accounts as per RBI/ Bank's policy.

      4. **Margin Money**

         **5.4,1.** The stipulations on margin money shall be in accordance with the guidelines of Reserve Bank of India issued from time to time. In case of loans up to Rs. 5 lakh, no margin money is required as per present norms.

         **5.4.2.** The margin money to be contributed by the general category entrepreneur will be as per prevailing norms. However, concessions would be made in respect of SCs/STs, women and beneficiaries of North-Eastern States, Hill areas. In such cases, a maximum of 50°/o of the  margin money prescribed by banks could be

given by NABARD to meet the shortfall in borrower's contribution, if the bank is satisfied that the borrower is unable to meet the margin money requirements. Such assistance to banks by NABARD will be without any interest. The banks may, however, levy a service charge up to 2% per annum from the borrowers.

5. **Security**

As most of the eligible activities pertain to agricultural input supply and services

**0**	and the cost of investment will be less than Rs. 25 lakh in most cases, the security norms	applicable	to	tiny	industries	as	prescribed	in	RBI	circular

No.RPCD.PLNFS.BC.65/06.02.31/ 99 2000 dated 31.3.2000 would be made applicable to these units. Accordingly, up to a loan amount of Rs. 5 rakh, the loans can be secured against hypot.hecation of assets created and no·further security would be necessary.

6. **Time limit for completion of the project**

   **f:t.6.1.** Time limit for completion of the project would be as envisaged under the project, subject to maximum of 6 months period from the date of disbursement of the first instalment of loan by\_ financial institution, which may be extended by a further period of 6 months, if reasons for such delay are considered justifiable by the financial institution concerned.

   **5.6.2,** If the project is not completed within the stipulated period, benefit of subsidy shall not be available and advance subsidy placed with the participating bank, if any, will have to be refunded forthwith to NABARD.

   7. **Other Conditions**

      1. The participating banks will adhere to the norms of appraising the projects regarding technical feasibility and commercial/financial viability.

         2. The participating banks should ensure insurance of the assets created under the project, wherever required statutorily. If beneficiary opts to buy insurance on these assets, even if insur ce is notrequired statutorily, such·expenditure will be an eligible component of the TFO.

         3. A sign board displaying "Assisted under the Scheme of Agri•Clinics and Agri­ Business Centres, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India" will be exhibited at the unit.  
         4. 	Pre and post completion inspection of the project shall be undertaken by the participating bank to verify\_physical, financial and operational·progress as and when required.

      8. **Refinance Assistance from NABARD**

      NABARD will provide refinance assistance to commercial banks, RRBs, SCBs, SCARDBs and other such eligible institutions at the rate of 100% of the amount financed by the banks as term loan. Rate of interest on refinance will be as decided by NABARD from time to time.

   6. **SUBSIDY**

      1. **Eligibility for Subsidy**

         1. In the Pre-revised Scheme, subsidy was admissible in respect of agriculture graduates trained under ACABC scheme on or after April 1, 2004, for fresh investments made after July 9, 2006\. The candidates trained under the Scheme prior to April 1, 2004 who have made investments after July 9, 2006, were to be considered on a case by case basis. Subject to fulfilment of all other eligibility conditions under the scheme, a Committee headed by Director General (DG), National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management (hereinafter referred to as MANAGE) used to take a decision in such matters. However, very few such cases have been received in lvlANAGE since it was set up, mainly due to ignorance among candidates and financing institutions and distance of MANAGE from their place of operation.

         2. Therefore, it has been decided to remove this cut\-off date of April 11 2004 qua the training date and henceforth all candidates trained under the .scheme shall be eligible for subsidy with respect to investments made after July 9, 2006 (Applicable for loan accounts sanctioned on or after this date). As agreed in the Review Meeting held on 09.11.2010, trained candidates whose knowledge acquired during the training might have become obsolete due to passage of time, may undergo a refresher course. Whether or not a candidate trained sufficiently long time ago needs his skills to be upgraded by refresher courses, shall be decided by the Selection Committee for candidates at the NTI level. However, need for such refresher trainings shall not be considered, if the training has been within 5 years before date of loan application. Funds for such skill upgradation

         charges, savings from funds allocated for refresher courses and budget earmarked for advertisement and publicity of ACABC Scheme with DOE.

         3. Delivery of extension services shall be the main component of ACABC projects for availing of the benefit of subsidy under the Scheme.

      2. **Linking Subsidy Adjustment to Delivery of Extension Services**

         1. 	Adequate safeguards are put in place to ensure providing extension services necessarily by the agri\-preneurs to their clients. In particular, payment of back­ ended subsidy will be linked to extension services provided by tl)e agri\-preneurs. For this purpose, any two out of a group of rank and status not below the following officials/ persons would make a periodic / surprise inspection at least on quarterly basis and submit its report to NABARD/ financing bank / office of ATMA. Record of advisory services provided to farmers by the agri\-preneurs as per the format given at Annexure XI may form the basis for providing the report.

1) Block Technology Manager/Subject Matter Specialists under.ATMA

2) Chairman (or his nominee), ATMA Block Farmers' Advisory Committee

3) Panchayat Members

4) NABARD / Bank official

5) Block level officer of State Department of Agriculture and allied sectors.

2. The financing bank will consider the periodic or surprise visit reports mentioned above while releasing the back-ended composite subsidy to the agri-preneur under

this Scheme. A consolidated report has to be finalized before the expiry of three  
0	years lock\-in period. The financing bank has to send the. report to the NABARD

0 	and ATMA for information. The report may highlight nature of enterprise initiated by agri-preneur, its coverage / reach, impact on income of agri-preneur, impact on

farmers and agricultural development in the area.

3. States are encouraged to provide information on all government policies, programmes, schemes etc to agri-preneurs and also use their services in implementation of extension activities funded by the government.

   3. **Change of Capital** & **Interest Subsidy to Composite Subsidy**

      1. Subsidy pattern has been revised from "capital and interest subsidy" to "Composite Subsidy" which will be back-ended in nature. It will be .44% of project cost for women, SC/ST & all categories of candidates from NE and Hill states and 36% of project cost for all' others. Interest subsidy scheme is replaced with enhanced quantum of back\-ended subsidy.  
         2. The subsidy admissible under the scheme will be kept in the "Subsidy Reserve Fund Account" (Borrower\-wise) in the books of the financing bank. No interest will be charged on this by the bank. In view of this, for the purpo\!:)es of charging interest on the loan component, the subsidy amount should be excluded. The balance lying to the credit of the "Subsidy Reserve Fund Account" will not form part of Demand and Time Liabilities. NABARD will ensure that the banks do not charge interest on subsidy portion of the loan, as back-ended subsidy is released to banks up-front.  
         3. 	In all new cases, subsidy will be released as Composite Subsidy (Annexure XIII). The subsidy in all such cases will be worked out on the basis of the Fixed Capital and one Operating Cycle of the Working Capital as a Composite Loan. Loan / subsidy {i.e. capital and interest) cases sanctioned so far (but not yet closed) shall be converted to Composite Subsidy regime and the differential amount between the Composite Subsidy and subsidy already released shall be paid to the Agricultural entrepreneur (agri-preneurs) as per the Scheme Guidelines (Annexure XIV). Entrepreneurs whose loan accounts have beeq closed can avail fresh loan to expand th project activity or start a new venture under the scheme in which case the TFO for subsidy calculation be limited to Rs. 20 lakh (25 lakh in case of extremely successful) Individual project and Rs. 100 lakh for Group project (Annexure- XV). Following criteria shall be taken into consideration while implementing the above instructions:  
1) 	Revised guidelines on TFO ceiling, revised rates of subsicJy etc., would be applicable only for cases sanctioned by banks on or after August 4, 2010\.  
2) 'Not yet closed' would be interpreted as 'all cases where at least an instalment of subsidy (capital or interest) is yet to be released by NABARD and those cases where full subsidy (capital and interest) has been released

butloan account is not closed (i.e. not fully repaid) as on 04 August, 2010\. However, the loan accounts (not closed) which are NPA as on August 4, 2010 will not be eligible for composite subsidy (only those who are regular in repayment should get the benefit of subsidy).

3) Although subsidy at enhanced rates will be available for projects where bank loan was sanctioned prior to August 4, 2010 (but after July 9, 2006\) they will not be eligible for higher TFO ceiling.

   4. The cases where capital subsidy has been disbursed but interest subsidy is yet to be disbursed or vice-versa, as per the pre-revised scheme,\_ such cases will be reopened and balance of composite subsidy as per the modified guidelines will be released in one lump-sum by NABARD to the concerned bank. Regional Offices of NABARD would obtain a claim for balance subsidy in such cases and sanction the same in the format given at Annexure XIV.  
      5. Candidates trained under this Scheme can avail subsidy from any Scheme of Central or State Government related to his/her field of agri-qusiness, if it is beneficial to the candidate. ·However, subsidy for the same project cannot be availed from more than one Scheme by a candidate.  
         6. 	Sometimes entrepreneurs start small and then ramp up their business later on. Therefore, it has been decided that the benefit of subsidy will be extended up to 2 times to a candidate under the Scheme as per the approved rates mentioned at

         6.3.1 of the project cost of Rs. 20/25 lakhs or Rs. 100 lakhs as the case may be. Such cases may include cases where the project is expanded in phases or financed in phases. However, if an existing venture is expanded or financed in phases, Composite Subsidy limits shall be reckoned only on such incremental component of Total Financial Outlay. Following are the cases where such a facility can be availed:

1. When two independent projects are financed to same beneficiaries.

2. When an existing project (that has availed sttbsidy under the scheme) is undergoing expansion.

3. 	If the fresh/ expansion of project is sanctioned by the bank before August 4, 2010, the TFO ceiling of 10.00 lakh (pre\-revised) will be applicable. The TFO ceiling of 20.00 lakh (revised) would be applicable only for fresh/ expansion of project sanctioned by the bank on or after August 4, 2010\.

   However, in all such cases the maximum amount of subsidy shall be limited to the stipulated TFO ceiling (for both projects put together). In case of expansion of an existing venture, composite subsidy shall be computed only on the TFO for expansion. This will not include the project cost of the existing project.

   7. 	The subsidy will be back \- ended with minimum 3 years lock-in period. This implies that once the loan is taken with subsidy, the account cannot be closed within three years,  
      8. 	The subsidy, which is back ended, will be admissible only if all repayments till date had been made.  
         9. 	The subsidy will be adjusted in one lump\-sum against the last remaining instalments of repayment of bank loan.

**Sub: Submission	of	project	profile-cum-subsidy	claim	under	AC\&ABC**  
**scheme by financing institutes-Extension in time frame-reg**

* Sir,

This has	reference to the communications received from NABARD and    
MANAGE regarding extending the time frame for submission of project profile­ cum-subsidy claim under AC\&ABC scheme. Para 6.4.2 of the guideline prescribes that the project profile and subsidy claim is to be submitted within 15 days of release of first installment of loan amount, through the controlling offices of the financial institutions/banks, to the Regional office of NABARD. Extension is being sought on this time frame.

Ministry has examined this and considers that the time frame of 15 days prescribed in the guideline is indicative to help fast processing of loan applications & subsidy releases to the eligible candidates and not a criteria for rejection of subsidy claims, eligible otherwise. Hence all the banks/financial institutions may be sensitized to process the loan applications and subsidy claims as early as possible and NABARD Regional Offices may be instructed to accept the claims which are genuine. It is also suggested that such cases of subsidy claims already rejected for the reason of submission after 15 days, may be re-considered by NABARD, if fulfilling the criterion otherwise.
