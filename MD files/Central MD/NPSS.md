The National Pest Surveillance System (NPSS) has been launched on 15th August, 2024 by the Hon'ble Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare to enhance the surveillance and management of pest diseases across the country. The system utilizes latest digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI and ML) to provide quick and instant solution regarding pest attacks, crop diseases, crop damages etc. by issuing real time crop protection advisory to the farmers. It includes a user-friendly mobile app and a portal for identification of pests and disease mitigation.

NPSS is being used by the farmers across the country for identification of pests and diseases in 61 crops and pest management advisories for 15 major crops namely cotton, paddy, wheat, maize, pigeon pea, moong, soyabean, sugarcane, brinjal, tomato, apple, banana, grapes, pomegranate. NPSS is currently available in four languages namely English, Hindi, Marathi and Punjabi. So far, 10154 pest management advisories have been issued through NPSS for the benefit of farmers.
